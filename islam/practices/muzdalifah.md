# Muzdalifah: The Sacred Night Stop of Hajj

![Pilgrims gathering at Muzdalifah during Hajj](muzdalifah_hajj.jpg)

Muzdalifah is a critical station in the journey of Hajj—an open plain between Mina and Arafat where pilgrims spend the night under the stars after their day of standing at Arafat on the 9th day of Dhul Hijjah. This sacred location, approximately 3 square kilometers in area, serves as both a physical resting place and a spiritual transition point between the climactic standing at Arafat and the rituals that follow at Mina. After sunset on the Day of Arafat, over two million pilgrims typically make their way to this unenclosed valley to perform the shortened and combined Maghrib and Isha prayers, collect small pebbles for the upcoming stoning rituals, and spend the night in contemplation before departing to Mina after midnight or at dawn. The distinctive experience of resting directly on the earth without tents or permanent structures connects pilgrims to the simplicity practiced by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ during his Farewell Pilgrimage and represents a profound moment of equality and spiritual reflection during the Hajj journey.
