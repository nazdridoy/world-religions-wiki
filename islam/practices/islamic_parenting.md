Islamic parenting represents a comprehensive approach to child-rearing guided by Quranic teachings and Prophetic traditions. This framework encompasses spiritual, moral, intellectual, and physical development with the ultimate goal of nurturing righteous individuals who benefit their families, communities, and humanity. Islam views children as divine trusts (amanah) bestowed upon parents, who bear the responsibility of guiding them toward righteousness while respecting their inherent dignity and unique qualities. From prenatal care through adolescence and beyond, Islamic parenting emphasizes balanced discipline with compassion, consistent religious education, character formation, and the parents' duty to model the behaviors they wish to instill. In contemporary contexts, Muslim parents navigate the challenge of preserving Islamic values while preparing children for meaningful engagement with diverse societies, demonstrating the timeless relevance of Islamic parenting principles across changing cultural landscapes.
