# Khushu: Concentration and Humility in Prayer

Khushu refers to the state of humble concentration, focus, and presence of heart during prayer (salat) in Islam. It represents the spiritual essence of prayer that transforms the physical movements into a meaningful communion with Allah. Far beyond mere ritual performance, khushu embodies the mindful engagement that makes prayer a transformative spiritual experience. When a Muslim achieves khushu, the prayer becomes a moment of genuine connection with the divine—a temporary departure from worldly concerns to focus completely on Allah. This central aspect of Islamic worship is described in the Quran: "Successful indeed are the believers who are humble in their prayers" (Quran 23:1-2), highlighting its significance in elevating the quality and spiritual impact of one's devotional practices.
