Taraweeh prayers are special nightly prayers performed during the Islamic month of Ramadan. Distinct from the five daily obligatory prayers, taraweeh is a recommended (sunnah) practice consisting of multiple units of prayer (rak'ahs) during which portions of the Quran are recited with the goal of completing the entire Quran by the end of the month. While not mandatory, taraweeh holds significant spiritual value in Islamic practice, representing devotion, community gathering, and intensive worship during the sacred month. The practice reflects the heightened spiritual consciousness that characterizes Ramadan and provides Muslims with an opportunity for extended night prayers, Quranic reflection, and communal solidarity.
