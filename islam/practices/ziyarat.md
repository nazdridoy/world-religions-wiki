# Ziyarat: Visitation of Sacred Sites

![Pilgrims visiting Islamic sacred sites](ziyarat_illustration.jpg)

Ziyarat, meaning "visit" or "visitation" in Arabic, refers to the practice of visiting sacred sites in Islam, particularly the graves of prophets, companions of Muhammad, and revered Islamic saints (awliya). While distinct from the obligatory Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, ziyarat holds significant spiritual value for many Muslims as an act of devotion, remembrance, and seeking blessing (barakah). The practice varies widely across different Islamic traditions, with Sunni and Shia Muslims having differing perspectives on its significance, permissibility, and proper conduct. Through these visits, Muslims seek to strengthen their spiritual connection, reflect on mortality, and honor the legacy of those who exemplified Islamic virtues.
