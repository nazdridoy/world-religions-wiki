# Salat: The Ritual Prayer in Islam

Salat, the ritual prayer performed five times daily, stands as the second pillar of Islam and forms the cornerstone of Muslim devotional life. Described in Islamic tradition as "the believer's ascension" (mi'raj al-mu'min), salat creates a direct connection between the worshipper and Allah, structuring the believer's day around remembrance of the divine. More than mere supplication, salat is a comprehensive act of worship involving specific physical movements, recitations, and mental focus that engages the entirety of the human beingâ€”body, mind, and soul. The Prophet Muhammad described salat as "the coolness of my eyes" and emphasized its centrality by stating, "The difference between us and them (non-believers) is salat; whoever abandons it has disbelieved." Through its consistent practice, Muslims affirm their submission to Allah, cultivate spiritual discipline, and maintain consciousness of divine presence throughout their daily lives.
