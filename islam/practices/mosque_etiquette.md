# Mosque Etiquette: Sacred Conduct in Islamic Houses of Worship

![Muslims observing proper etiquette in a mosque](mosque_etiquette.jpg)

Mosque etiquette encompasses the comprehensive set of traditional practices, customs, and behavioral norms that guide Muslims' conduct when visiting and worshiping in a mosque (masjid). These protocols are derived from Quranic injunctions, prophetic traditions (hadith), scholarly consensus, and culturally evolved practices that collectively emphasize reverence, mindfulness, and community harmony in sacred spaces. Far more than mere formalities, mosque etiquette reflects Islam's holistic approach to worship—where physical actions, social interactions, and internal spiritual states are integrated elements of devotion. By observing these practices, Muslims honor the mosque's status as Allah's house on earth (buyūt Allāh), demonstrate respect for fellow worshippers, and create an atmosphere conducive to focused worship and spiritual contemplation. Whether entering a mosque for daily prayers, Friday congregations, or special occasions, these time-honored customs help maintain the mosque's sanctity while facilitating an optimal environment for individuals and the community to connect with their Creator.
