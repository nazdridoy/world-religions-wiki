# Islamic Calendar (Hijri Calendar)

![Islamic lunar calendar with crescent moon](islamic_calendar.jpg)

The Islamic calendar (at-taqwīm al-hijrī) represents a distinctive lunar timekeeping system that has structured Muslim religious and cultural life for over fourteen centuries. Consisting of twelve lunar months totaling 354 or 355 days, this calendar—established during Caliph Umar's reign—begins with the momentous migration (Hijra) of Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE, marking year one of the Islamic era. Unlike solar calendars, the Hijri calendar follows the moon's phases completely, with each month beginning at the sighting of the new crescent moon (hilal), creating a calendar that migrates through the seasons, completing a full solar year cycle approximately every 33 years. This lunar foundation directly connects to Quranic injunctions regarding worship timing and reflects Islam's emphasis on natural observation and divine ordering of time. While presenting practical challenges in a world dominated by the Gregorian calendar, the Islamic calendar remains central to determining religious observances including Ramadan, the Hajj, and Islamic festivals, serving as both a practical timekeeping method and a profound spiritual framework that connects Muslims across generations to their religious heritage and to cosmic rhythms established by divine design.
