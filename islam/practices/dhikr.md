# Dhikr: Remembrance of Allah

Dhikr (also transliterated as zikr or thikr), Islam's practice of divine remembrance, represents the quintessential meditative dimension of Muslim spirituality—a practice that transforms mundane moments into sacred encounters with the Divine. Far more than simple recitation, dhikr embodies the Quranic injunction to "remember Allah standing, sitting, and [lying] on your sides" (4:103), infusing everyday existence with awareness of the Divine. Through repetitive phrases glorifying Allah, requesting forgiveness, or affirming divine unity, practitioners anchor themselves in transcendent reality amid worldly distractions. Whether performed through silent contemplation, whispered recitation, melodic chanting, or bodily movement, dhikr creates sacred time and space within ordinary life. This practice—described by the Prophet Muhammad as "the best of your deeds" and "the most purifying for your hearts"—serves as both spiritual technique and transformative state of being. For Muslims across diverse traditions, dhikr manifests the Quranic promise that "verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest" (13:28), offering a pathway to inner tranquility, spiritual presence, and intimate communion with the Divine reality that underlies all existence.
