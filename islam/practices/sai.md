# Sa'i: The Ritual Walk Between Safa and Marwah

![Pilgrims performing Sa'i between the hills of Safa and Marwah](sai_illustration.jpg)

Sa'i, meaning "to strive" or "to seek" in Arabic, is an essential ritual of both Hajj and Umrah where pilgrims walk seven times between the small hills of Safa and Marwah, adjacent to the Kaaba in Mecca. This ritual commemorates the desperate search of Hajar (Hagar), wife of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham), for water to quench the thirst of her infant son Ismail (Ishmael) after they were left in the barren valley of Mecca by divine command. Her faith-driven effort, running anxiously between the two hills, was rewarded when God caused the miraculous spring of Zamzam to gush forth. Today, pilgrims reenact this profound display of trust in God, perseverance, and maternal devotion, finding in it lessons of steadfastness, active faith, and divine responsiveness to human need.
