# Waqf: Islamic Endowments for Community Benefit

![Historic waqf complex with mosque, school, and public fountain](waqf_complex.jpg)

Waqf (plural: awqaf) is one of Islam's most distinctive socio-religious institutions—a form of perpetual charitable endowment that has shaped Muslim societies for over thirteen centuries. By dedicating property or assets for religious or charitable purposes in perpetuity, Muslims establish a continuous flow of benefits for the community while securing spiritual rewards that continue even after death. Throughout Islamic history, waqf institutions have funded mosques, schools, hospitals, public fountains, libraries, and countless social services, creating a sustainable civil infrastructure that combines pious intentions with practical community development. This uniquely Islamic institution embodies the faith's emphasis on charitable giving, social responsibility, and the concept that all wealth ultimately belongs to God and should benefit His creation.
