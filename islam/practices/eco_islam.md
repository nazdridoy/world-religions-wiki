# Eco-Islam: Environmental Ethics and Practices

![Muslim environmental stewardship](eco_islam.jpg)

Eco-Islam represents the growing movement that connects Islamic spiritual and ethical teachings with environmental consciousness and sustainable practices. Drawing upon Quranic principles, prophetic guidance, and traditional Islamic legal concepts, eco-Islam reframes contemporary environmental challenges through an Islamic worldview that emphasizes human responsibility as stewards (khalifah) of the Earth. Rather than being a modern innovation, eco-Islam recovers and applies classical Islamic principles about resource conservation, animal welfare, and ecological balance to current environmental crises. As Muslims worldwide increasingly recognize the alignment between faith obligations and environmental protection, eco-Islamic practices and perspectives offer both practical approaches to sustainable living and a theological framework that motivates environmental activism as an expression of religious devotion.

## Theological Foundations

### Stewardship (Khilafah)
- **Humans as trustees**
  - Quranic designation of humans as khalifah (stewards/vicegerents)
  - "It is He who has appointed you vicegerents on the earth" (Quran 6:165)

  - Earth as a sacred trust from Allah
  - Accountability for how natural resources are used

### Creation as Divine Signs

  - Natural world reflecting divine attributes
  - "And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and the diversity of your languages and colors. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge" (Quran 30:22)
  - Contemplation of nature as a form of worship

- **Respect for creation**
  - All created beings as communities like humans

### Balance and Moderation
