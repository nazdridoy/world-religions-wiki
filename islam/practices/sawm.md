# Sawm: The Islamic Practice of Fasting

![Muslims breaking fast at sunset during Ramadan](sawm_iftar.jpg)

Sawm (صَوْم) is the Arabic term for fasting and represents the fourth pillar of Islam. Most prominently practiced during the holy month of Ramadan, sawm requires Muslims to abstain from food, drink, smoking, and sexual relations from dawn (fajr) until sunset (maghrib) for the entire lunar month. This practice of self-restraint extends beyond physical abstention to include guarding one's speech, actions, and thoughts against immoral or negative expressions. Rooted in the Quranic injunction "O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become righteous" (2:183), sawm serves as an annual period of spiritual renewal, self-discipline, and increased devotion. The fast is not merely hunger or thirst but a comprehensive spiritual exercise designed to purify the soul, strengthen willpower, cultivate empathy for the less fortunate, and deepen one's relationship with Allah.
