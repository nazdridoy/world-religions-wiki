Wudu (also spelled Wudhu or Wudoo) is the Islamic ritual washing performed by Muslims before prayer, Quran recitation, and other acts of worship. This purification ritual is a prerequisite for the validity of salat (prayer) and represents both physical cleanliness and spiritual preparation. The practice originates from the Quranic command: "O you who believe! When you prepare for prayer, wash your faces and your hands to the elbows, wipe your heads, and wash your feet to the ankles" (Quran 5:6). Through this methodical cleansing, Muslims enter a state of ritual purity (tahara) while cultivating mindfulness of God's presence and preparing mentally and spiritually for communion with the Divine.
