# Mahr: The Islamic Bridal Gift

Mahr is a mandatory gift from the husband to the wife upon marriage in Islam, representing a fundamental financial right that establishes the economic foundation of the marital relationship. Unlike a bride price paid to the woman's family or a dowry brought by the bride, mahr is a direct gift to the wife herself, becoming her exclusive property that she may use or invest as she wishes. This practice, firmly established in the Quran and Prophetic tradition, serves multiple purposes: honoring the woman, providing her with financial security, symbolizing the husband's commitment, and establishing the seriousness of the marital contract. From simple token amounts to substantial wealth transfers, mahr practices vary widely across Muslim cultures while maintaining the core religious requirements of being a genuine gift that becomes the bride's personal asset.
