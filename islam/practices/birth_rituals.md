# Birth Rituals in Islam: Welcoming New Life

![Muslim family celebrating birth with rituals](birth_rituals_islam.jpg)

In Islam, the arrival of a child is celebrated as a divine blessing and profound responsibility. From the moment a baby is born, a series of traditional practices and religious rituals are performed to welcome the newborn into the Muslim community, establish their identity as a believer, and secure their spiritual well-being. These rituals—including the adhan (call to prayer) whispered in the newborn's ear, tahnik (sweetening the baby's palate), choosing a meaningful name, shaving the head, and performing aqiqah (sacrifice)—combine spiritual significance with practical customs that have been observed since the Prophet Muhammad's time. Together, they mark the beginning of a child's journey in faith, acknowledge the parents' gratitude to Allah, and integrate the infant into the broader Muslim community. While varying in expression across different cultures, these practices reflect Islam's deep reverence for new life and the importance placed on raising children in accordance with Islamic principles.
