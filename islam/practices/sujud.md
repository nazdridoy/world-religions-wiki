# Sujud: Prostration in Islamic Prayer

![Muslim in prostration during prayer](sujud_prayer.jpg)

Sujud, the act of prostration in Islamic prayer, represents the pinnacle of submission and humility in a Muslim's worship. When a worshiper places their forehead, nose, palms, knees, and toes on the ground, they demonstrate the ultimate physical expression of reverence to Allah. This position—where the head, considered the most noble part of the human body, touches the ground—symbolizes complete surrender to the divine will. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said, "The servant is nearest to his Lord during prostration," highlighting sujud as a moment of profound spiritual intimacy. Occurring twice in each prayer unit (rakah), prostration embodies Islam's central theological principle that humans achieve their highest spiritual station through humble submission to their Creator, making it both physically and spiritually the lowest yet most exalted position in prayer.
