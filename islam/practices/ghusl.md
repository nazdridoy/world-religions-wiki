![Illustration of water for ghusl purification](ghusl_illustration.jpg)

Ghusl is the Islamic ritual of full-body purification through washing with water. More comprehensive than the partial ablution (wudu), ghusl becomes obligatory after certain events or states including sexual intercourse, emission of semen, completion of menstruation, childbirth, and upon embracing Islam. This major ritual purification is an essential prerequisite for various acts of worship and represents the spiritual cleansing necessary to approach Allah in a state of complete purity. The practice, established through the Quran and exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad, combines physical cleanliness with spiritual readiness, embodying Islam's holistic approach to worship and purity.

## Theological Foundations

### Quranic Basis
- **Divine Command**:
  - "O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying or in a state of janabah [major ritual impurity], except those passing through [a place of prayer], until you have washed [your whole body]..." (Quran 4:43)
  - "And if you are in a state of janabah, then purify yourselves." (Quran 5:6)
  - Connection between physical cleanliness and spiritual readiness
  - Emphasis on purity before approaching Allah in worship

- **Conceptual Framework**:
  - Distinction between minor impurity (requiring wudu) and major impurity (requiring ghusl)
  - Understanding of tahara (purity) as essential to Muslim life
  - Ritual purity as preparation for communion with the Divine
  - Balance between inner purity and outer cleanliness

### Prophetic Example
- **Sunnah Methods**:
  - Prophet Muhammad's detailed instructions for ghusl
  - Multiple authentic narrations describing his practice
  - Emphasis on thoroughness and intention
  - Demonstration of water conservation even in ritual washing

- **Contextual Guidance**:
  - Occasions when the Prophet performed ghusl
  - His teachings about necessity versus recommendation
  - Adaptations for different circumstances (illness, travel)
  - Balance between ritual requirements and practical considerations
