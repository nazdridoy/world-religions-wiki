# Aqiqah: The Islamic Birth Celebration

![Family celebrating Aqiqah with sacrifice and feast](aqiqah_celebration.jpg)

Aqiqah is the Islamic tradition of sacrificing an animal on the occasion of a child's birth as an expression of gratitude to Allah. This practice, established by the Prophet Muhammad, traditionally takes place on the seventh day after birth and coincides with other important newborn rituals such as naming the child and shaving the baby's head. More than merely a celebration, aqiqah serves multiple spiritual and social functions: it expresses parents' thankfulness for their child, establishes the infant's identity in the Muslim community, provides charity to those in need, and follows the prophetic example. While not obligatory according to most scholars, aqiqah is strongly recommended and widely practiced across Muslim communities worldwide, though with various cultural adaptations. Through this meaningful sacrifice, families inaugurate their child's life journey with generosity, communal connection, and remembrance of Allah's blessings.
