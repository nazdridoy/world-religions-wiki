# Istighfar: The Practice of Seeking Divine Forgiveness

![Muslim in prayer seeking forgiveness](istighfar.jpg)

Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) represents a foundational spiritual practice in Islam, embodying the recognition of human imperfection and the boundless mercy of Allah. This practice involves the verbal, mental, and heartfelt acknowledgment of one's sins and shortcomings, accompanied by sincere repentance and commitment to improvement. The Quran repeatedly emphasizes Allah's attribute as Al-Ghafoor (The Most Forgiving), encouraging believers to seek forgiveness regularly. Prophet Muhammad exemplified this practice by performing istighfar at least 70-100 times daily despite his sinless status. Beyond mere verbal repetition, authentic istighfar involves genuine remorse, cessation of sinful behavior, commitment to improvement, restoration of rights, and renewed dedication to obedienceâ€”creating a transformative spiritual discipline that purifies the soul, renews faith, and maintains a humble, conscious relationship with the Divine.
