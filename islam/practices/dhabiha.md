# Dhabiha: Islamic Method of Animal Slaughter

![Islamic ritual slaughter illustration](dhabiha_method.jpg)

Dhabiha refers to the prescribed Islamic method of slaughtering animals for meat consumption, transforming what would otherwise be merely a functional process into a sacred ritual. This method emphasizes respect for the animal's life, minimization of suffering, and acknowledgment that all life belongs to Allah. For meat to be considered halal (permissible), it must be obtained through this specific process, which includes invoking Allah's name, using a sharp instrument for a swift, clean cut of the throat vessels, and allowing complete blood drainage. The dhabiha method represents Islam's holistic approach to consumption, where ethical treatment of animals, hygienic practices, and spiritual mindfulness converge. By ritualizing slaughter, Islam elevates a necessary act for human sustenance into an opportunity for remembrance of divine providence and the cultivation of compassion toward all living beings.
