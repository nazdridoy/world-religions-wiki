# Muraqaba: Islamic Spiritual Vigilance and Meditation

![Muslim in deep meditative state of muraqaba](muraqaba.jpg)

Muraqaba, derived from the Arabic root meaning "to watch over" or "to observe," represents a profound Islamic spiritual practice involving conscious awareness of Allah's perpetual presence and vigilant observation of one's inner states. This contemplative discipline transcends mere meditation, embodying a comprehensive spiritual attitude where the practitioner maintains constant awareness that Allah observes all thoughts, feelings, and actions. Rooted in the Quranic emphasis on divine omniscience and the prophetic tradition of ihsan (excellence in faith), muraqaba cultivates a heightened state of God-consciousness (taqwa) through systematic attention to one's spiritual heart. While sharing superficial similarities with meditative practices in other traditions, muraqaba remains distinctly Islamic in its theological foundations, methodological approaches, and ultimate purposeâ€”transforming the believer's consciousness to achieve perpetual awareness of divine presence, leading to spiritual illumination, ethical refinement, and the progressive unveiling of deeper spiritual realities.
