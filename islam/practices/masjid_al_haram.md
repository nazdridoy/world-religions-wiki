Masjid al-Haram, the Sacred Mosque of Mecca, stands as Islam's holiest sanctuary and the focal point of Muslim devotion worldwide. Enclosing the sacred Ka'bah—the cubic structure believed to have been built by the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Isma'il (Ishmael)—this grand mosque represents the physical and spiritual center of Islam. As the destination of the annual Hajj pilgrimage and the direction of prayer (qiblah) for Muslims everywhere, Masjid al-Haram embodies both divine connection and human history. With continual expansions throughout Islamic history, from its humble beginnings to its current capacity of over two million worshippers, the mosque reflects the evolution of Islamic civilization while maintaining its essential role as the earthly focus of divine worship, where the temporal and eternal intersect in a space venerated by over 1.8 billion Muslims.
