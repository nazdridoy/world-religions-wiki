# Witr: The Odd-Numbered Prayer in Islam

![Muslim performing witr prayer](witr_prayer.jpg)

Witr is a special Islamic prayer characterized by its odd number of prayer units (rak'ahs), typically performed as the final prayer of the night. This uniquely structured worship serves as a spiritual seal to a Muslim's daily prayers, with the word "witr" itself meaning "odd number" in Arabic. While not among the five obligatory daily prayers, witr holds a highly emphasized status, with the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ consistently maintaining this practice throughout his life, even while traveling. The distinct odd-numbered format—usually three, five, seven, or eleven rak'ahs—symbolizes the Islamic concept of Allah's oneness and preference for odd numbers. Traditionally performed after the night ('Isha) prayer and before dawn (Fajr), witr provides believers with a final opportunity for supplication and spiritual connection before retiring for the night or concluding late-night devotions, making it a cherished practice that bridges obligatory worship with voluntary devotion.
