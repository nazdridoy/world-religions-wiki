# Environmental Ethics in Islam

![Natural landscape with Islamic calligraphy](islamic_environmental_ethics.jpg)

Islamic environmental ethics is rooted in the fundamental principle that humans are khalifah (trustees) appointed by Allah to care for the earth and its resources. This divine stewardship carries profound responsibilities toward all creation, establishing a holistic framework of ecological consciousness that predates modern environmentalism by centuries. Through Quranic injunctions, prophetic traditions, and foundational Islamic legal principles, Muslims are guided to maintain balance (mizan) in nature, avoid waste and excess (israf), respect all living beings, and ensure just distribution of natural resources. These teachings have historically shaped Muslim societies' relationship with the environment and are increasingly relevant as contemporary Muslims navigate global ecological challenges. By reviving and reinterpreting these rich traditions, Islamic environmental ethics offers a spiritually grounded approach to sustainability that balances human needs with the rights of all creation.

## Theological Foundations
