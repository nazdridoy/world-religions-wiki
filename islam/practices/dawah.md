# Dawah: Invitation to Islam

![Muslims engaged in dawah activity sharing Islamic literature](dawah.jpg)

Dawah (دعوة), literally meaning "invitation" or "call," is the Islamic practice of inviting people to understand and embrace the faith through dialogue, education, and outreach. Rooted in the Quranic injunction to "invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction" (16:125), dawah represents Islam's missionary dimension, though it differs significantly from proselytization in other religious traditions. As a fundamental religious duty, dawah encourages Muslims to share their faith through exemplary conduct, reasoned discourse, and compassionate engagement rather than coercion. Throughout Islamic history, dawah methodologies have evolved from personal conversations to sophisticated global movements employing modern communication technologies, while maintaining core principles of respect for human dignity, freedom of choice, and peaceful persuasion.
