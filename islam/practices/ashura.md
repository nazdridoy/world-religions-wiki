# Ashura: The Tenth of Muharram

![Ashura observance with prayer and remembrance](ashura.jpg)

Ashura, observed on the 10th day of Muharram (the first month of the Islamic calendar), holds profound religious significance across various Muslim traditions. For Sunni Muslims, it commemorates the day when Prophet Musa (Moses) and his followers were saved from Pharaoh through divine intervention, while for Shia Muslims, it marks the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, at the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE. This day of historical remembrance, spiritual reflection, and communal solidarity invites Muslims to contemplate sacrifice, justice, and moral courage while renewing their commitment to stand against oppression and uphold divine principles regardless of consequences.
