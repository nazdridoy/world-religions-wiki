# Quranic Recitation: Tilawah and Tajwid

![Person reciting Quran with proper technique](quran_recitation.jpg)

Quranic recitation (Tilawah) is a profound spiritual practice in Islam that involves the melodic, rhythmic, and rules-based vocalization of the Quran. Muslims believe the Quran is the literal word of Allah as revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, making its proper recitation not merely an artistic endeavor but a deeply sacred act. The science of proper recitation, known as Tajwid, encompasses precise rules governing pronunciation, phonetics, and rhythm. Through this practice, Muslims connect directly with divine revelation, seeking both spiritual elevation and a deeper understanding of Allah's message. The Quran itself encourages its melodious recitation: "Recite the Quran with measured rhythmic tones" (Quran 73:4), making this practice central to Islamic worship and spiritual development.
