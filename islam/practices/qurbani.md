# Qurbani: Animal Sacrifice in Islamic Tradition

![Qurbani sacrifice during Eid al-Adha](qurbani_sacrifice.jpg)

Qurbani (also called Udhiyah) is the ritual animal sacrifice performed during Eid al-Adha, commemorating Prophet Ibrahim's (Abraham's) willingness to sacrifice his son in obedience to Allah. This practice represents one of Islam's most profound demonstrations of devotion and sacrifice. When Allah intervened and provided a ram to sacrifice instead, this divine substitution established a tradition that Muslims worldwide continue to observe. Beyond its religious significance, Qurbani embodies principles of generosity, community welfare, and gratitude, as the meat from the sacrificed animals is divided among family, friends, and those in needâ€”ensuring that everyone in the community can participate in the celebration.
