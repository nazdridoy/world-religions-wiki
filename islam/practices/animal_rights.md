# Animal Rights in Islam

![Muslim caring for animals illustration](islamic_animal_care.jpg)

Islam presents a comprehensive ethical framework regarding humanity's relationship with animals, established over fourteen centuries ago at a time when animal welfare was rarely considered. Through Quranic injunctions and prophetic teachings, Muslims are instructed to view animals not as mere resources but as communities like humans, deserving of compassionate treatment and respect. Islamic tradition balances human utilization of animals for food, transportation, and labor with strict guidelines that prohibit cruelty, mandate humane treatment, and recognize animals' intrinsic value as Allah's creation. From specific rules about slaughter methods to broader principles about kindness toward all creatures, Islam promotes a stewardship model where humans are accountable for their treatment of animals in this world and the next. These principles continue to inform Muslim perspectives on contemporary animal welfare issues, providing an ethical foundation that bridges traditional religious values with modern concerns about animal rights.
