# Mihrab: The Sacred Prayer Niche

The mihrab is one of the most distinctive architectural features in Islamic sacred spaces, serving as a prayer niche that indicates the qiblah—the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca, which Muslims face during prayer. More than merely functional, the mihrab evolved into a highly symbolic and often elaborately decorated focal point within mosques worldwide. This concave niche typically built into the qiblah wall represents the spiritual gateway toward the holiest site in Islam and symbolizes the presence of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ who once led prayers. While not explicitly mentioned in the Quran or early hadith collections, the mihrab emerged during the first Islamic century as a practical innovation that soon acquired deep theological significance. Its development reflects the interplay between worship requirements, artistic expression, and cultural adaptations throughout Islamic civilization, making it both a universal element in mosque architecture and a canvas for regional artistic traditions.
