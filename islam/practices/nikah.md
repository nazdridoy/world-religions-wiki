# Nikah: Islamic Marriage

![Traditional Islamic marriage ceremony](nikah_ceremony.jpg)

Nikah, the Islamic marriage contract, represents a sacred covenant between a man and woman that establishes legal intimacy and forms the foundation of family life in Muslim society. More than just a social arrangement, marriage in Islam is described as completing "half of one's faith" and serves multiple purposes: fulfilling human companionship needs, providing a legitimate framework for intimacy, ensuring societal continuity, and creating a nurturing environment for raising children. The Prophet Muhammad emphasized marriage as his sunnah (practice), encouraging Muslims to marry when able. While the specific customs surrounding marriage vary widely across different Muslim cultures, the core religious requirements remain consistent, focusing on mutual consent, public declaration, and contractual clarity regarding rights and responsibilities.
