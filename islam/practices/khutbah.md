# Khutbah: The Islamic Sermon

![Imam delivering khutbah from a minbar](khutbah.jpg)

The khutbah is a formal sermon or religious address in Islam, most prominently delivered during the Friday (Jumu'ah) congregational prayers, but also presented during Eid celebrations and other significant occasions. As a divinely ordained practice mentioned in the Quran (62:9) and established by the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, the khutbah serves as a vital bridge between religious knowledge and community practice. More than mere oratory, it represents a sacred institution through which spiritual guidance, moral instruction, social cohesion, and intellectual engagement flow into the Muslim community. Throughout Islamic history, the khutbah has evolved in form while maintaining its essential function as a means of religious education, community counsel, and spiritual nourishment. The khutbah embodies Islam's emphasis on the integration of knowledge and action, combining theological reflection with practical guidance for daily life, making it one of the most enduring and universally practiced elements of Islamic tradition across diverse cultures and time periods.
