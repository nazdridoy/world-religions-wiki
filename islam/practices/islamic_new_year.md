The Islamic New Year marks the beginning of the Hijri calendar, occurring on the first day of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic lunar year. Unlike secular new year celebrations, the Islamic New Year is characterized by quiet reflection rather than elaborate festivities. It commemorates the Hijrah (migration) of Prophet Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE, a pivotal event that established the first Muslim community and marked the beginning of Islamic civilization. This observance invites Muslims to contemplate historical sacrifice, renewal of faith, and spiritual recommitment while recognizing the passage of time as a divine gift requiring mindful stewardship.
