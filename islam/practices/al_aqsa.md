![Al-Aqsa Mosque with the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem](al_aqsa.jpg)

Al-Aqsa Mosque (المسجد الأقصى‎, Al-Masjid al-Aqsa, "the Farthest Mosque") holds profound significance in Islamic tradition as Islam's third holiest site after Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina. Located in the Old City of Jerusalem, it stands on the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif or "Noble Sanctuary"), the site mentioned in the Quran as the destination of the Prophet Muhammad's Night Journey (Isra) and the location from which he ascended to heaven (Mi'raj). The term "Al-Aqsa" refers both to the silver-domed mosque itself and, more broadly, to the entire 35-acre compound that includes the Dome of the Rock, Islamic museums, and other religious structures. For Muslims worldwide, Al-Aqsa represents a vital spiritual connection to prophetic history, serves as a powerful symbol of religious identity, and constitutes an essential pilgrimage site that has shaped Islamic devotion and practice for over fourteen centuries.
