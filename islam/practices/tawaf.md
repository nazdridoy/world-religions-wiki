# Tawaf: The Ritual Circumambulation of the Kaaba

Tawaf is the Islamic ritual of circumambulating (walking around) the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, seven times in a counterclockwise direction. This practice represents one of the most central and visually distinctive acts of Islamic worship, performed during both Hajj (the annual pilgrimage) and Umrah (the lesser pilgrimage). As pilgrims circle Islam's holiest structure, they engage in a practice dating back to the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and symbolically express their unity of purpose in worshipping Allah while physically manifesting their spiritual orbit around the divine center of their faith. The repeated circling embodies the concept that Allah is the axis of the believer's existence, with all actions and intentions revolving around divine guidance.
