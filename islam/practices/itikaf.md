# I'tikaf: Spiritual Retreat in the Mosque

![Muslim in I'tikaf in a mosque](itikaf.jpg)

I'tikaf, derived from the Arabic root meaning "to devote" or "to seclude oneself," represents a profound spiritual practice in Islam where believers temporarily withdraw from worldly affairs to reside in a mosque for dedicated worship and contemplation. This practice of sacred seclusion embodies the essence of spiritual focus, creating a protected space and time for deepening one's relationship with Allah through prayer, Quranic recitation, remembrance, and reflection. Rooted in the Prophetic tradition—Muhammad consistently observed i'tikaf during the last ten days of Ramadan—this practice serves as a spiritual intensive that allows Muslims to temporarily set aside worldly distractions and immerse themselves in devotional activities. While most commonly associated with Ramadan's final days, i'tikaf transcends mere ritual observance to become a transformative spiritual experience that purifies the heart, clarifies the mind, and strengthens the soul's connection to its Creator, ultimately preparing the practitioner for more mindful engagement with the world upon return.
