# Qiyam: The Standing Position in Islamic Prayer

![Muslim in qiyam position during prayer](qiyam_prayer.jpg)

Qiyam, the standing position in Islamic prayer (salat), represents the fundamental posture that initiates each prayer cycle (rakah) and embodies the respectful stance of a servant before Allah. This essential element of Islamic worship symbolizes the human being's upright position before their Creatorâ€”expressing readiness, attentiveness, and humility. During qiyam, Muslims stand with focused intention, reciting the opening chapter of the Quran (Al-Fatiha) and additional verses, establishing the spiritual foundation for the physical movements that follow. The significance of qiyam extends beyond its physical aspect, embodying the spiritual uprightness and moral rectitude that Islam encourages in all aspects of life, making it both a bodily position and a metaphor for the believer's relationship with God.
