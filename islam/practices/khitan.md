# Khitan: Islamic Male Circumcision

![Islamic circumcision ceremony illustration](khitan_ceremony.jpg)

Khitan, the practice of male circumcision in Islam, represents an important religious tradition that connects Muslims with the Abrahamic covenant while serving as a symbol of Islamic identity and cleanliness. Unlike other Islamic rituals directly mentioned in the Quran, circumcision derives its religious significance primarily from prophetic tradition (sunnah) and scholarly consensus, with most jurists considering it obligatory or highly recommended for Muslim males. While commonly performed during infancy or early childhood in many Muslim cultures, the timing, ceremonial aspects, and social expressions surrounding khitan vary considerably across different regions—from simple medical procedures to elaborate community celebrations. This practice bridges religious obligation, cultural heritage, and modern medical considerations, evolving continually as Muslims balance traditional religious values with contemporary health practices and ethical discourse on children's bodily autonomy.
