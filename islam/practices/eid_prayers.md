# Eid Prayers: Celebrating Islamic Festivals

![Eid prayer congregation in an open field](eid_prayers.jpg)

Eid prayers (Salat al-Eidain) are special congregational prayers performed during Islam's two major festivals: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Distinct from the five daily prayers, these unique devotional gatherings mark joyous occasions in the Islamic calendar and embody the community spirit central to Islam. Performed in the morning after sunrise, Eid prayers feature distinctive elements including additional takbirs (declarations of Allah's greatness) and are followed by a sermon addressing themes of gratitude, unity, and spiritual renewal. As one of Islam's most visible communal rituals, Eid prayers bring together Muslims across social and economic divisions, manifesting the egalitarian principles of the faith while creating a shared experience of celebration and worship that reinforces both individual faith and communal bonds.
