Masjid al-Nabawi, the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, stands as Islam's second-holiest sanctuary after Masjid al-Haram in Mecca. Originally built by Prophet Muhammad himself shortly after his migration (Hijrah) to Medina in 622 CE, it served not only as a place of worship but also as the center of the first Muslim community's social, political, and educational activities. Today, this magnificent mosque encompasses the final resting place of Prophet Muhammad beneath its distinctive green dome, making it a profoundly significant pilgrimage destination visited by millions of Muslims annually. Through successive expansions over fourteen centuries—from its humble beginnings as a simple rectangular structure to its current capacity of over one million worshippers—Masjid al-Nabawi embodies the continuity of Islamic tradition while symbolizing the enduring spiritual connection between Muslims and their Prophet. The mosque's unique status is reflected in the hadith stating that prayer within its precincts carries a reward equal to a thousand prayers elsewhere (except Masjid al-Haram), underlining its special place in Islamic devotional geography.
