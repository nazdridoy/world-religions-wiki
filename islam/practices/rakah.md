# Rak'ah: The Fundamental Units of Islamic Prayer

The rak'ah (plural: raka'at) constitutes the fundamental building block of Islamic prayer (salat), representing a complete sequence of standing, bowing, and prostrating postures accompanied by specific recitations. Every prescribed prayer consists of a designated number of these units, which combine physical movement with mental focus and verbal remembrance to create a holistic form of worship. The Arabic word "rak'ah" derives from the root meaning "to bow," highlighting the central bowing motion (ruku') that characterizes each unit. Through the systematic repetition of these prayer units, Muslims engage in a comprehensive act of submission that integrates body, mind, and spirit in worship of Allah.
