Shab-e-Barat (Night of Fortune or Night of Innocence), observed on the 15th night of Sha'ban (the eighth month of the Islamic calendar), holds special significance as a night when Allah's mercy and forgiveness are believed to be abundant. Known by various names across the Muslim world—Laylat al-Bara'ah in Arabic, Berat Kandili in Turkish, and Nim Sha'ban in Persian—this night is traditionally understood as a time when divine decrees for the coming year are determined. While not mentioned explicitly in the Quran, various hadith and cultural traditions have elevated its importance, particularly in South Asia, Turkey, and parts of the Middle East.
