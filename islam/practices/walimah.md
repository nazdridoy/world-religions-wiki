# Walimah: The Islamic Wedding Feast

![Islamic wedding feast](walimah_feast.jpg)

Walimah is the traditional Islamic wedding feast or celebration held after the marriage contract (nikah) has been completed. This festive gathering serves as a public announcement of the marriage, bringing together family, friends, and community members to witness and celebrate the union. The walimah represents an important social and religious practice that fulfills the Prophetic tradition of announcing marriages publicly, distinguishing a legitimate union from a secret one, and sharing joy with the community. While the nikah itself constitutes the legal and religious marriage ceremony, the walimah completes the social dimension of marriage in Islamic tradition, emphasizing community participation, generosity, and the celebration of a divinely-sanctioned relationship.
