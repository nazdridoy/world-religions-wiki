# Laylat al-Qadr: The Night of Power

![Mosque illuminated during Laylat al-Qadr](laylat_al_qadr.jpg)

Laylat al-Qadr, commonly translated as "The Night of Power" or "The Night of Decree," stands as one of Islam's most sacred and mysterious nights—a singular evening during Ramadan when the Quran began its revelation to Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. This momentous night carries extraordinary spiritual significance, described in the Quran as "better than a thousand months" (97:3), indicating that worship performed during these blessed hours holds greater spiritual value than continuous devotion for over 83 years. While its precise date remains deliberately concealed within the odd-numbered nights of Ramadan's final ten days (with particular emphasis on the 27th night in many traditions), this divine ambiguity inspires believers to intensify their spiritual efforts throughout this period. Muslims worldwide commemorate this night through extended prayer, Quranic recitation, contemplation, and supplication—seeking divine forgiveness, spiritual elevation, and the special mercies that descend as "angels and the Spirit come down, by the permission of their Lord, with every decree" (97:4). The night represents a cosmic moment when divine destiny is manifested, prayers find special acceptance, and the veil between the created and divine realms grows thin, offering believers an unparalleled opportunity for spiritual transformation and divine connection.
