Laylat al-Qadr, often translated as the "Night of Power" or "Night of Decree," represents the most sacred night in the Islamic calendar. Commemorating the first revelation of the Qur'an to Prophet Muhammad through the angel Jibril (Gabriel), this night is described in the Qur'an as "better than a thousand months" (97:3). While its exact date remains deliberately unspecified, most Islamic traditions place it within the last ten nights of Ramadan, with particular emphasis on the odd-numbered nights (21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, or 29th). Characterized by intensified worship, night-long prayer, and spiritual contemplation, Laylat al-Qadr is considered a time of extraordinary divine blessing when prayers are especially efficacious, sins are forgiven, and divine decrees for the coming year are believed to be determined. For Muslims worldwide, this night represents the spiritual apex of Ramadan, embodying the quintessence of divine revelation, mercy, and spiritual opportunity.
