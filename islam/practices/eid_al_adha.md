Eid al-Adha, also known as the Feast of Sacrifice or Greater Eid, is one of the two major Islamic festivals celebrated worldwide. It commemorates Prophet Ibrahim's (Abraham's) willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of submission to Allah's command, and Allah's mercy in providing a ram as a substitute sacrifice. This significant festival occurs on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the final month of the Islamic lunar calendar, and marks the conclusion of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. As a celebration of faith, sacrifice, and community, Eid al-Adha embodies core Islamic values of submission to Allah, charitable giving, and strengthening family and community bonds.
