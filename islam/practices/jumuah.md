![Jumu'ah prayer at a mosque](jumuah_prayer.jpg)

Jumu'ah (Friday Prayer) is a central communal ritual in Islam, serving as the weekly congregational prayer held every Friday in place of the Zuhr (noon) prayer. Considered obligatory for adult male Muslims, it represents one of Islam's most significant religious gatherings. The Qur'an specifically mentions this prayer: "O you who believe! When the call is made for prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave business" (62:9). Beyond its ritual significance, Jumu'ah establishes a powerful rhythm to Muslim life, reinforcing community bonds, spiritual renewal, and Islamic education through the khutbah (sermon) that accompanies the prayer.
