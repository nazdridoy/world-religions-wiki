Muslim communities in Western societies represent a significant and growing demographic navigating the practice of their faith within predominantly non-Muslim cultural, political, and social contexts. From historic communities to recent immigrants and converts, Western Muslims develop distinctive approaches to maintaining Islamic practices while engaging with secular or Christian-influenced environments. This experience encompasses both challenges—such as balancing religious obligations with workplace demands, confronting misconceptions, and addressing Islamophobia—and opportunities for developing contextually relevant expressions of faith that contribute to religious diversity and pluralism. The evolving practices of Western Muslims illustrate Islamic tradition's adaptability and the dynamic interplay between religious commitment and cultural context, often producing innovative theological approaches, institutional forms, and community structures that enrich both Islamic tradition and Western societies.
