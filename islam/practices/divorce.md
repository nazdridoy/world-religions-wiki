# Divorce in Islam: Dissolution of Marriage with Dignity

![Image of Islamic legal documents](islamic_divorce.jpg)

While marriage in Islam is highly valued as a sacred covenant and foundation for family life, Islamic law recognizes that some unions cannot be sustained. Divorce (talaq) in Islam represents a carefully structured process that acknowledges human realities while establishing protections for both parties, especially women and children. Though described in a hadith as "the most detested permissible act in the sight of Allah," divorce is permitted as a last resort when reconciliation efforts have failed and continuing the marriage would cause greater harm than its dissolution. Islamic divorce procedures balance the need for decisive resolution with safeguards against impulsive decisions, incorporating waiting periods, financial provisions, and mediation attempts. These regulations aim to provide a framework for ending marriages that preserves dignity, ensures material support, protects children's welfare, and allows for the possibility of reconciliation when feasible.
