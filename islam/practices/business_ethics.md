![Image of halal business transaction](islamic_business_ethics.jpg)

Islamic business ethics represents a comprehensive moral framework that guides economic activity according to Islamic principles, seeking to integrate spiritual values with commercial pursuits. Rather than separating religious and economic spheres, Islam provides a holistic approach that views business transactions as acts that carry both worldly and spiritual consequences. These ethics are derived from the Quran, Prophetic traditions (hadith), scholarly consensus, and analogical reasoning, forming a system that emphasizes justice, transparency, mutual benefit, social responsibility, and the understanding that all wealth ultimately belongs to God. From prohibitions against interest and excessive speculation to encouragement of fair dealing and charitable giving, Islamic business ethics aims to create economic prosperity while maintaining moral integrity, balancing the pursuit of profit with ethical constraints that preserve human dignity and social welfare.
