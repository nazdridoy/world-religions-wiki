# Mawlid: Celebrating the Prophet's Birth

![Mosque illuminated for Mawlid celebration](mawlid.jpg)

Mawlid an-Nabi (Birth of the Prophet) commemorates the birthday of Prophet Muhammad, observed primarily on the 12th day of Rabi' al-Awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar. This observance, practiced in most Muslim countries and communities worldwide, represents a significant expression of love and reverence for the Prophet through poetry, prose, gatherings, charity, and spiritual reflection. While not practiced during early Islamic history and considered a religious innovation by some scholars, Mawlid celebrations have become deeply embedded in Muslim cultural traditions across diverse regions, serving as occasions for Muslims to renew their connection to prophetic teachings, express communal solidarity, and cultivate deeper appreciation for Muhammad's exemplary character and enduring spiritual legacy.
