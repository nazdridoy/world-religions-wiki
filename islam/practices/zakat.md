# Zakat: The Purification of Wealth

![Zakat being given to the poor](zakat_charity.jpg)

Zakat is the third pillar of Islam, representing the obligatory giving of a portion of one's wealth to specified categories of people in need. This practice serves as both a spiritual purification of wealth and a practical mechanism for social welfare within the Muslim community. Unlike voluntary charity (sadaqah), zakat is a mandatory religious duty for every Muslim who possesses wealth above a prescribed threshold (nisab) for one lunar year. The word "zakat" in Arabic linguistically means "purification" and "growth," signifying how this practice purifies the remainder of one's wealth and leads to its spiritual and material blessing, while fostering compassion, social responsibility, and economic justice within the ummah (Muslim community).

  - Graduated scale for livestock
- **Zakatable Assets**:
  - Cash and monetary holdings
  - Gold and silver
  - Trade inventory and business assets
