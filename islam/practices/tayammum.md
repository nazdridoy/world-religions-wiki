# Tayammum: Dry Ablution in Islam

![Illustration of tayammum dry ablution procedure](tayammum_illustration.jpg)

Tayammum is a ritual purification practice in Islam that serves as a substitute for wudu (minor ablution) or ghusl (major ablution) when water is unavailable, insufficient, or when its use might cause harm. This provision exemplifies Islam's emphasis on both ritual purity and practicality, demonstrating the religion's consideration of circumstances and human limitations. As mentioned in the Quran (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:6), tayammum represents a divine concession that allows Muslims to maintain their prayer schedule even in challenging situations, thereby preserving the essential connection between the believer and Allah.

- **Textual Guidance**:
  - "...and if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and find no water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands [with it]. Allah does not intend to make difficulty for you, but He intends to purify you and complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful."
  - Emphasis on Allah's intention to provide ease

### Prophetic Teachings
- **Hadith Foundation**:
  - Prophet Muhammad's demonstrations of proper technique
