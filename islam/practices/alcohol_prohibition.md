# Alcohol Prohibition in Islam

The prohibition of alcohol (khamr) represents one of Islam's most well-known dietary restrictions and stands as a clear example of how Islamic law seeks to protect individuals and society from harm. This prohibition was revealed progressively in the Quran, acknowledging the cultural attachment to alcohol while gradually establishing a complete ban. Today, abstention from alcohol remains a defining characteristic of Muslim identity worldwide, though interpretations and adherence vary across different cultural contexts and individual practices.

## Quranic Foundation

### Progressive Revelation
- **First Stage**: Initial recognition of both benefits and harms
  - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:219) - "They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, 'In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit.'"
  - Acknowledgment of some utility while emphasizing greater harm
  - No explicit prohibition at this stage

- **Second Stage**: Restriction on prayer while intoxicated
  - Surah An-Nisa (4:43) - "O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying"
  - Created practical limitations on alcohol consumption
  - Established connection between worship and sobriety

- **Third Stage**: Complete prohibition
  - Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:90-91) - "O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters, and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful. Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not desist?"
  - Definitive prohibition establishing alcohol as haram (forbidden)
  - Connects prohibition to social harmony and spiritual focus

### Definition of Khamr
- Hadith of the Prophet: "Every intoxicant is khamr, and every khamr is haram" (Sahih Muslim)
- Extends prohibition to all intoxicating substances regardless of source
- Applies to substances that "cloud the mind" (literal meaning of khamr)
