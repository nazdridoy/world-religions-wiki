# Shahadah: The Islamic Declaration of Faith

![Calligraphy of the Shahadah](shahadah_calligraphy.jpg)

The Shahadah (Arabic: الشهادة‎, aš-šahādah, "the testimony") is the Islamic declaration of faith and the first of the Five Pillars of Islam. This simple yet profound statement—"Lā ʾilāha ʾillā Llāh, Muḥammadun rasūlu Llāh" (There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah)—serves as the foundation of Muslim identity and belief. Uttering this declaration with sincere conviction marks one's entry into the Islamic faith. More than just words, the Shahadah encapsulates the essential monotheistic doctrine of Islam (tawhid) and affirms the prophetic mission of Muhammad as the final messenger of God. This testimony is simultaneously a rejection of polytheism, a confirmation of Islamic monotheism, and an acknowledgment of divine revelation through prophethood.
