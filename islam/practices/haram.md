# Haram: Prohibited Matters in Islam

![Image of common prohibited items in Islam](haram_prohibitions.jpg)

Haram in Islam refers to that which is forbidden by divine commandâ€”actions, substances, and behaviors explicitly prohibited in Islamic law. Derived from the Quran and Prophetic traditions, these prohibitions form essential ethical boundaries that shape Muslim life, establishing moral limits intended to protect individual well-being, social harmony, and spiritual integrity. While the term "haram" is often associated with dietary restrictions, it encompasses a much broader range of prohibitions affecting worship, business transactions, interpersonal relations, and personal conduct. These prohibitions are not arbitrary restrictions but are understood as divine guidance designed to safeguard human welfare across physical, psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions. The concept of haram works in complementary opposition to halal (the permissible), together forming a comprehensive ethical framework that guides Muslim decision-making across all aspects of life.
