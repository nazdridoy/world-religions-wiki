# Umrah: The Lesser Pilgrimage

Umrah, often referred to as the "lesser pilgrimage" or "minor pilgrimage," is a sacred Islamic ritual involving a visit to the Kaaba in Mecca. Unlike Hajj, Umrah can be performed at any time of the year and is not obligatory for Muslims, though it is highly recommended as a spiritually enriching act of devotion. The Arabic word "Umrah" stems from "i'timaar," meaning "to visit a populated place." Through this sacred journey, Muslims seek spiritual purification, forgiveness of sins, and a deeper connection with their faith. The ritual provides a profound opportunity for believers to walk in the footsteps of Prophet Muhammad and commemorate the legacy of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his family, while experiencing the spiritual unity of the global Muslim community.
