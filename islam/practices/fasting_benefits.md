Fasting in Islam transcends mere abstention from food and drink to encompass a comprehensive system of physical, spiritual, psychological, and social benefits. As one of the five pillars of Islam, fasting (sawm) during Ramadan and recommended voluntary fasts throughout the year serves multiple purposes in the holistic development of the Muslim individual and community. The multilayered benefits of Islamic fasting reflect its divine origin as a practice designed to purify the soul, discipline the body, and strengthen communal bondsâ€”all while conferring numerous health advantages scientifically recognized in contemporary research. Through temporary physical deprivation, the fasting person gains lasting spiritual elevation and a deeper appreciation of Allah's blessings, developing greater empathy for those in need and heightened consciousness of the Creator.
