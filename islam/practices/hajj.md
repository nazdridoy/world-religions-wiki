Hajj is the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and represents the fifth pillar of Islam. This mandatory religious duty must be carried out at least once in a lifetime by every adult Muslim who is physically and financially capable. Taking place during Dhul Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic lunar calendar, Hajj commemorates the actions of the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham), his wife Hajar (Hagar), and their son Ismail (Ishmael). The pilgrimage unites Muslims of all races, nationalities, and socioeconomic backgrounds in a profound demonstration of equality before God as they perform a series of rituals over five to six days. With origins dating back to the time of Ibrahim, restored by Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE, and now drawing over two million participants annually, Hajj represents one of the world's largest regular gatherings of people and serves as a powerful symbol of Muslim unity, submission to Allah, and spiritual renewal.
