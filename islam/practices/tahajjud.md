# Tahajjud: The Night Prayer

Tahajjud prayer, often called "the night vigil" or "night prayer," represents one of Islam's most profound spiritual practices—a voluntary prayer performed in the depths of night, during the hours when most people sleep. It embodies the height of devotional intimacy between the worshipper and Allah, occurring in what the Quran describes as "the watches of the night" (73:20). While not obligatory like the five daily prayers, tahajjud carries exceptional spiritual significance, being emphasized in both Quranic verses and numerous Prophetic traditions. This special prayer offers spiritual seekers an opportunity for solitude with their Creator, a time when prayers are more readily accepted, sins forgiven, and the soul finds its greatest peace. Through regular tahajjud practice, Muslims seek to follow the example of the Prophet Muhammad, who never abandoned this prayer even during his most challenging times, and aim to cultivate a deeper consciousness of the Divine presence.
