# Hijab: Modesty and Identity in Islamic Dress

![Illustration of various styles of hijab](hijab_styles.jpg)

Hijab refers primarily to the Islamic principle of modesty in dress and behavior, though it is commonly associated with the headscarf worn by many Muslim women. This practice emerges from Quranic injunctions and prophetic traditions that encourage modest appearance for both men and women, though with specific applications for each gender. For Muslim women who observe hijab, it represents a multifaceted religious practice encompassing spiritual devotion, identity expression, cultural heritage, and personal choice. Beyond its physical manifestation, hijab embodies a philosophy of modesty that extends to conduct, speech, and interaction in society, reflecting the Islamic value of haya (modesty and shyness) as a virtue that preserves dignity and fosters respectful relationships between genders.
