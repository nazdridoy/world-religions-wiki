# Minbar: The Pulpit of Islamic Oratory

![Ornate wooden minbar in a mosque](minbar.jpg)

The minbar is an elevated pulpit in mosques from which the imam delivers the Friday sermon (khutbah) and other important religious addresses. This distinctive architectural feature, typically positioned to the right of the mihrab (prayer niche), has evolved from the Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ simple raised platform to elaborate structures that often showcase the pinnacle of Islamic woodworking, stone carving, or metalwork. Beyond its practical function of elevating the speaker for better visibility and acoustics, the minbar holds profound symbolic significance as a representation of religious authority, knowledge transmission, and community guidance. Throughout Islamic history, the minbar has served as a critical communication hub for religious instruction, social cohesion, and occasionally political discourse, making it not merely a piece of mosque furniture but a central institution in Muslim communal life that embodies the integration of spiritual, educational, and societal dimensions of the faith.
