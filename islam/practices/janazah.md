Janazah refers to the comprehensive set of Islamic funeral rites and practices surrounding death, burial, and mourning. These practices are designed to honor the deceased, comfort the bereaved, and remind the community of life's impermanence while affirming the Islamic belief in resurrection and afterlife. From the moment of death through burial and beyond, Islamic funeral practices combine religious obligations with expressions of respect and compassion, maintaining dignity for the deceased while providing structured support for grieving families. Though cultural variations exist across the Muslim world, the core religious requirements remain consistent, emphasizing simplicity, promptness, community participation, and the theological understanding that the soul has returned to its Creator. These practices serve both practical and spiritual purposes, facilitating the transition of the deceased to the afterlife while guiding the living through the process of loss and remembrance.
