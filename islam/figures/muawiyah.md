![Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan](../../images/muawiyah.jpg)

Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan (c. 602-680 CE) was the founder of the Umayyad Caliphate and ruled as the first Umayyad caliph from 661 to 680 CE. Initially an opponent of Islam and Prophet Muhammad, he later converted and rose to prominence as a scribe of revelation, a military commander, governor of Syria, and ultimately the fifth caliph. His controversial rise to power following the First Fitna (civil war) and his establishment of hereditary dynastic rule marked a pivotal transition in early Islamic history.

## Early Life and Conversion

Muawiyah's background set the stage for his political career:

- Born around 602 CE in Mecca into the powerful Banu Umayya clan of the Quraysh tribe
- Son of Abu Sufyan and Hind bint Utbah, both prominent opponents of early Islam
- His father led the Meccan forces against Muslims at the Battle of Badr (624 CE)
- Converted to Islam along with his father and other Meccans after the conquest of Mecca in 630 CE
- Appointed as one of the scribes who recorded Quranic revelations
- Was the brother-in-law of Muhammad through his sister Umm Habiba, who was one of the Prophet's wives

## Rise to Prominence

Muawiyah's political ascension was methodical:

- Served as a military commander during the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar
- Participated in the conquest of Syria under his brother Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan
- Appointed by Caliph Umar as governor of Damascus after his brother's death
- Expanded his authority when Caliph Uthman, his cousin, appointed him governor of all Syria
- Developed Syria into a power base, building a strong army and navy
- Conducted successful naval campaigns against the Byzantine Empire
- Became the first Muslim leader to establish a significant naval force in the Mediterranean
- Built an efficient administrative system in Syria, incorporating Byzantine practices

## Conflict with Ali

The dispute between Muawiyah and Ali ibn Abi Talib shaped early Islamic political divisions:

- After Uthman's assassination in 656 CE, refused to pledge allegiance to newly elected Caliph Ali
- Demanded justice for his murdered kinsman Uthman before acknowledging Ali's authority
- Raised an army in Syria to challenge Ali, claiming to avenge Uthman's blood
- Led his forces against Ali's at the Battle of Siffin (657 CE)
- When facing defeat, reportedly had his soldiers raise Qurans on spears calling for arbitration
- The arbitration at Adhruh (659 CE) failed to resolve the dispute but weakened Ali's position
- Proclaimed himself caliph in Jerusalem in 660 CE, creating a rival caliphate in Syria
- After Ali's assassination in 661 CE, negotiated with Ali's son Hasan for the caliphate
- Secured sole rule through the "Year of Unity" (Aam al-Jama'ah) when Hasan abdicated

## Caliphate and Administration

As caliph, Muawiyah established systems that would define the Umayyad era:

- Moved the capital from Kufa to Damascus, shifting the Islamic political center northward
- Established an efficient postal system (barid) for communications across the empire
- Organized a sophisticated intelligence network for political control
- Created the diwan al-khatam (chancellery) that sealed official documents
- Maintained Byzantine administrative structures in conquered territories
- Employed Christians and other non-Muslims in his administration
- Continued the expansion of the Islamic empire into North Africa and Central Asia
- Strengthened the navy, targeting Byzantine naval power and conducting raids on Cyprus and Rhodes
- Built the Dome of the Rock complex in Jerusalem, a significant early Islamic monument
- Established Arabic as the administrative language, replacing Greek and Persian

## Controversial Legacy

Muawiyah's legacy remains complex and divisive:

- Transformed the caliphate from an elected office to a hereditary monarchy when he appointed his son Yazid as successor
- This breach of the election principle is condemned by many Muslim historians
- Instituted the practice of public cursing of Ali in Friday prayers, which continued until Umar II ended it
- Depicted positively in Sunni tradition as a companion of the Prophet and a capable administrator
- Viewed critically in Shia Islam as a usurper who denied Ali and his descendants their rightful leadership
- Credited with maintaining unity in the Islamic world after the First Fitna
- Criticized for emphasizing Arab supremacy over non-Arab Muslims (mawali)
- Praised for his political acumen, diplomatic skills, and administrative innovations

## Character and Personal Qualities

Contemporary accounts describe Muawiyah as:

- Patient, forbearing, and diplomatic (his hilm or forbearance was legendary)
- Politically shrewd and pragmatic rather than ideologically rigid
- Generally mild in punishment and preferring bribery over force
- Eloquent in speech and persuasive in negotiation
- Tolerant of opposition when it did not threaten his rule
- Quote attributed to him: "I do not apply my sword where my lash suffices, nor my lash where my tongue is enough. Even if there was only one hair binding me to my people, I would not let it break."
