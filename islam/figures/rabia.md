Rabi'a al-Adawiyya al-Qaysiyya (c. 717-801 CE) was a prominent Muslim saint, mystic, and poet who made profound contributions to the early development of Sufism. She is particularly renowned for introducing the concept of Divine Love (hub Allah) as the central element in the Sufi approach to God, emphasizing a relationship with the Divine based on love rather than fear of punishment or hope for reward.

## Life and Early Years

Born in Basra, Iraq, around 717 CE into a poor family, Rabi'a's life began with hardship. According to traditional accounts, she was orphaned at a young age and later separated from her sisters during a famine. She was captured and sold into slavery but eventually gained her freedom due to her master's recognition of her extraordinary piety and spiritual devotion.

After gaining freedom, she lived an ascetic life, dedicating herself entirely to worship and contemplation. She reportedly refused numerous marriage proposals, including one from the famous Sufi Hassan of Basra, preferring to maintain her complete devotion to God alone.

## Spiritual Approach and Teachings

Rabi'a's mystical approach represented a revolutionary development in Islamic spirituality. Her key contributions include:

- **Disinterested Love of God**: She taught that God should be loved for His own sake, not for fear of Hell or desire for Paradise. This concept is captured in her famous prayer: "O God! If I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell, and if I worship You in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise. But if I worship You for Your Own sake, grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty."

- **Divine Intimacy**: She emphasized direct, personal communion with God.

- **Spiritual Equality**: As a woman who achieved high spiritual status, she demonstrated that the path to God was open to all regardless of gender.

- **Asceticism**: She embraced voluntary poverty and rejection of worldly pleasures as a means of purifying the heart for divine contemplation.

## Poetic Legacy

Though few of her works have survived in written form, several poems and prayers attributed to her have been preserved through oral tradition and the writings of later Sufi authors. Her poetry expresses the depth of her mystical experiences and devotion:

"I have loved Thee with two loves:  
A selfish love and a love that is worthy.  
As for the love which is selfish,  
I occupy myself therein with remembrance of Thee to the exclusion of all others.  
As for that which is worthy of Thee,  
Therein Thou raisest the veil that I may see Thee.  
Yet is there no praise to me in either this or that,  
But the praise is to Thee, whether in that or this."

## Influence on Sufism

Rabi'a's influence on the development of Sufism has been profound and enduring:

- She shifted the focus of Sufi practice from asceticism based on fear to mysticism based on love.
- She introduced the concept of unconditional divine love that became central to later Sufi thought.
- Her life and teachings served as an inspiration for both male and female mystics who came after her.
- She legitimized women's spiritual authority within the Islamic tradition.
- She provided a model of celibate devotion to God that offered an alternative to conventional roles for women.

## Historical Context and Legacy

Rabi'a lived during the formative period of Islamic thought, when the foundations of Islamic law, theology, and mysticism were being established. Her perspective provided a counterbalance to the more legalistic approaches developing at the time, emphasizing the inner dimension of religious experience.

Though historical details of her life are sometimes difficult to separate from hagiographical elements added by later admirers, her impact on Islamic spirituality is undeniable. She is remembered as:

- One of the first Sufi mystics to articulate the doctrine of Divine Love
- A pioneer of women's spiritual leadership in Islam
- A model of piety and devotion for all Muslims, regardless of gender
- A precursor to the great flowering of Persian Sufi poetry that would follow centuries later
