Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792 CE) was an influential Islamic scholar, theologian, and reformer from the Najd region of central Arabia. He founded what became known as the Wahhabi movement, a puritanical reform movement advocating a return to what he viewed as the pristine Islam of the early Muslim community (salaf). His alliance with Muhammad ibn Saud established a powerful religious-political partnership that eventually led to the formation of the Saudi state, and his theological vision continues to influence Islamic thought worldwide, particularly Salafism and related movements.

## Early Life and Education

Born in the town of Uyaynah in Najd, central Arabia:

- Raised in a family of Hanbali scholars; his father was a judge (qadi)
- Received his early education from his father in Islamic jurisprudence
- Demonstrated exceptional intelligence and memorized the Quran at a young age
- Traveled extensively for knowledge, studying in Medina, Basra, and possibly Damascus
- Influenced by the works of Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya
- Developed growing concerns about what he perceived as religious innovations and deviant practices
- Returned to Najd with a reformist vision after completing his studies

His intellectual formation occurred during a period when much of the Islamic world was experiencing political decline and what he viewed as religious stagnation.

## Religious Reforms and Teachings

Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's reformist ideology centered on several key principles:

### Strict Monotheism (Tawhid)

- Emphasized absolute monotheism (tawhid) as the core of Islam
- Divided tawhid into three categories: oneness of lordship, worship, and divine names/attributes
- Condemned what he saw as shirk (polytheism) in popular religious practices
- Opposed veneration of saints, tomb visitation, and intercession through the Prophet or saints
- Rejected mystical practices he deemed contrary to pure monotheism

### Opposition to Innovations

- Called for eliminating bid'ah (religious innovations) not founded in early Islam
- Advocated direct engagement with Quranic and hadith texts rather than reliance on later interpretations
- Criticized established schools of jurisprudence for uncritical following (taqlid)
- Sought to restore what he believed was the pure practice of the salaf (early Muslims)
- Rejected celebrations of the Prophet's birthday and certain Sufi practices

### Political Implementation

- Promoted the concept of commanding right and forbidding wrong through state power
- Advocated physical enforcement of religious norms
- Called for jihad against those he deemed polytheists, including fellow Muslims he considered deviant
- Envisioned a society governed exclusively by his interpretation of Islamic law

## Alliance with Ibn Saud

The pivotal moment in Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's life came with his alliance with Muhammad ibn Saud in 1744:

- Expelled from his hometown of Uyaynah for his controversial views
- Found refuge in Dir'iyyah, where he met Muhammad ibn Saud
- Formed a pact where Ibn Saud would protect and implement Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's religious teachings
- Ibn Saud adopted Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's religious ideology as the state's official doctrine
- This alliance marked the beginning of the first Saudi state
- Their descendants continue to rule Saudi Arabia today, with the Al Sheikh (Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's descendants) serving as religious authorities alongside the Al Saud political leadership

This political-religious alliance created a powerful movement that eventually conquered much of the Arabian Peninsula.

## Major Works

Ibn Abd al-Wahhab authored several influential texts:

- **Kitab al-Tawhid** (Book of Monotheism) - His most famous work outlining his concept of pure monotheism
- **Kashf al-Shubuhat** (Clarification of Doubts) - Addressing objections to his teachings
- **Usul al-Iman** (Foundations of Faith) - Detailing essential beliefs of Islam
- **Al-Qawa'id al-Arba'** (The Four Rules) - Explaining key principles regarding polytheism
- **Nawaaqid al-Islam** (Nullifiers of Islam) - Listing actions that invalidate one's Islam
- Multiple treatises on specific issues like prayer, jurisprudence, and Quranic interpretation

His writings are characterized by direct language, extensive use of Quranic verses and hadith, and strong polemics against opposing viewpoints.

## Legacy and Influence

Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's impact has been profound and controversial:

- Established a religious movement that became the official interpretation of Islam in Saudi Arabia
- Influenced modern Salafi movements worldwide, though not all Salafis accept the Wahhabi label
- Inspired various Islamic revivalist movements in the 19th-20th centuries
- His ideas spread globally through Saudi funding of mosques, schools, and literature
- Remains a polarizing figure, viewed as a purifier of Islam by followers and as extreme by critics
- Critics accuse his movement of fostering intolerance, while supporters see him as reviving authentic Islam
- His vision shapes contemporary debates about Islamic orthodoxy, innovation, and practice

The global spread of oil wealth in the 20th century allowed Saudi Arabia to promote his teachings internationally, magnifying his influence far beyond Arabia.

## Controversies

Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's legacy is marked by several major controversies:

- His takfir (excommunication) of Muslims who didn't accept his interpretations
- Destruction of historical sites and tombs in areas under his movement's control
- Military campaigns against other Muslim communities deemed deviant
- Rigid application of his understanding of Islamic law
- Treatment of Shiites and Sufis, whom he considered outside true Islam
- Whether his movement represents authentic Hanbali thought or a deviation from it
- His relationship with Ottoman authorities, whom his followers eventually opposed

These controversies continue to shape discussions about his movement's place within broader Islamic traditions.
