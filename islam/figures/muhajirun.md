# Muhajirun

![Muhajirun](../../images/muhajirun.jpg)

The Muhajirun (Arabic: المهاجرون, "the emigrants" or "those who undertook Hijrah") were the first converts to Islam who fled from Mecca to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in 622 CE to escape persecution from the Quraysh tribe. This migration, known as the Hijrah, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar and was a pivotal moment in early Islamic history.

## Historical Context

Prior to the Hijrah, the early Muslims in Mecca faced increasing persecution from the city's polytheistic leaders who viewed Muhammad's monotheistic message as a threat to their religious, social, and economic systems. Following the death of Muhammad's uncle and protector Abu Talib and his wife Khadijah, the situation became increasingly dangerous for the Muslim community.

After establishing initial contact with people from Yathrib who had accepted Islam (later known as the Ansar), Muhammad instructed his followers to gradually migrate to this more welcoming city. This migration occurred in small groups over several months, with Muhammad himself being among the last to leave Mecca.

## Significance in Islamic History

The Muhajirun hold a special place in Islamic history for several reasons:

- **Faith and Sacrifice**: They demonstrated extraordinary commitment to their faith by leaving behind homes, property, businesses, and sometimes family ties for the sake of their religious beliefs.

- **Foundation of Ummah**: Together with the Ansar (the "helpers" from Medina), they formed the core of the first Muslim community or ummah.

- **Quranic Recognition**: The Quran specifically praises the Muhajirun in several verses, acknowledging their sacrifice and promising them divine reward.

- **Political Significance**: Their migration transformed Islam from a persecuted religious movement to a political entity with territory and governance.

- **Calendar Marker**: The importance of their migration is reflected in the adoption of the Hijrah as the starting point of the Islamic lunar calendar.

## Notable Muhajirun

Among the prominent individuals who undertook the Hijrah were:

- **Abu Bakr al-Siddiq**: Muhammad's closest companion who accompanied him during the journey from Mecca to Medina.

- **Umar ibn al-Khattab**: Future second caliph who initially emigrated with about twenty other Muslims.

- **Uthman ibn Affan**: Wealthy merchant who would become the third caliph.

- **Ali ibn Abi Talib**: Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law who stayed behind in Mecca initially to fulfill the Prophet's instructions.

- **Bilal ibn Rabah**: Former slave who became the first muezzin (caller to prayer) in Islam.

- **Suhaib al-Rumi**: Byzantine-origin companion who gave up his wealth to emigrate.

- **Abu Salamah and Umm Salamah**: Early emigrants; Umm Salamah later became a wife of the Prophet.

## Brotherhood Between Muhajirun and Ansar

One of Prophet Muhammad's first acts upon arriving in Medina was to establish a system of brotherhood (mu'akhat) between the Muhajirun and Ansar. Each emigrant was paired with a "helper" from Medina who would share his wealth, home, and resources. This unprecedented social bond helped:

- Integrate the newcomers into Medinan society
- Alleviate the economic hardship of those who had left everything behind
- Create a new social order based on faith rather than tribal affiliation
- Demonstrate Islamic principles of brotherhood and solidarity

This relationship is considered one of the most successful examples of refugee integration in history and is frequently cited as an exemplar of Islamic social values.

## Legacy in Islamic Thought

The status of the Muhajirun established several important concepts in Islamic thought:

- **Hijrah as spiritual concept**: Beyond the historical event, hijrah came to symbolize the spiritual journey from sin to faith, or from wrong to right.

- **Precedence (sabiqah)**: Early conversion and migration established a concept of precedence in virtue and status within the community.

- **Model of sacrifice**: Their willingness to sacrifice worldly possessions for faith became a model for later generations.

- **Political legitimacy**: In early Islamic political thought, being from the Muhajirun was considered an important qualification for leadership.
