# Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini

Ayatollah Ruhollah Mousavi Khomeini (1902-1989) was an Iranian political and religious leader who founded the Islamic Republic of Iran and served as its first Supreme Leader. A prominent Shia cleric, philosopher, and revolutionary, Khomeini led the 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the Pahlavi monarchy and established a new theocratic system of government. His political theory of Wilayat al-Faqih (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) transformed traditional Shia political thought and continues to shape Iranian politics and broader Islamic political movements.

## Early Life and Education

Born in Khomein, central Iran, to a family of religious scholars, Khomeini lost his father to the violence of local landowners when he was only a few months old. Raised by his mother and aunt, he began his religious education at a young age, studying Arabic grammar, logic, and Islamic jurisprudence.

In 1922, he moved to the Shia seminary center of Qom, where he studied under prominent scholars including Ayatollah Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi. While pursuing traditional religious studies, Khomeini also developed interests in philosophy, mysticism (irfan), and ethics. He became recognized as a mujtahid (qualified to make independent legal judgments) by the 1930s and achieved the rank of Ayatollah by the 1950s.

## Political Activism and Exile

Khomeini's political activism emerged gradually, but several key events shaped his opposition to the Shah's regime:

- In 1941, he published his first political treatise, "Kashf al-Asrar" (Unveiling of Secrets), criticizing secularization policies
- During the early 1960s, he vocally opposed the Shah's "White Revolution" reforms, particularly land reform and women's suffrage
- In June 1963, his arrest after a fiery speech against the Shah sparked major protests now commemorated as the "15 Khordad Uprising"
- Following his release, he continued criticizing the regime, particularly the immunity granted to American military personnel in Iran

In 1964, Khomeini was exiled from Iran, first to Turkey, then to Iraq where he lived in Najaf for 13 years. During this period, he refined his revolutionary ideology and delivered his famous lectures on "Islamic Government" that outlined the Wilayat al-Faqih theory. These lectures, circulated on cassette tapes in Iran, formed the theoretical foundation for the coming revolution.

In 1978, pressure from the Shah led Iraq to expel Khomeini, who then settled in Neauphle-le-Ch√¢teau near Paris. This strategic location provided him better access to international media and became the command center for the revolution.

## The Iranian Revolution

From exile, Khomeini orchestrated opposition to the Shah through a network of clerical students, utilizing modern communication methods while building a broad revolutionary coalition that included secular nationalists, leftists, and Islamists. His simple but powerful messaging promised independence from foreign influence, social justice, and a return to Islamic values.

As protests intensified through 1978, Khomeini maintained an uncompromising stance against the Shah's regime. On February 1, 1979, he returned triumphantly to Iran, greeted by millions of supporters. Ten days later, the monarchy collapsed, and Khomeini quickly moved to consolidate power. 

Initially appointing a provisional government led by secular nationalist Mehdi Bazargan, Khomeini simultaneously established parallel revolutionary institutions, including the Revolutionary Guard and revolutionary committees. Through a carefully managed referendum, the Islamic Republic was formally established with overwhelming approval in April 1979.

## Political Theory and Governance

Khomeini's most significant ideological contribution was his theory of Wilayat al-Faqih:

1. **Traditional Background**: Traditionally, Shia doctrine held that in the absence of the Twelfth Imam (believed to be in occultation), religious authorities should provide guidance but not direct political rule.

2. **Khomeini's Innovation**: He argued that during the Imam's occultation, the most qualified jurist should assume political leadership to ensure implementation of Islamic law.

3. **Justification**: He framed this as necessary to protect Islam from corruption and foreign influence, and to create a just society.

4. **Implementation**: This theory became enshrined in Iran's 1979 constitution, creating the position of Supreme Leader with extensive powers over all branches of government.

Under his leadership, the Islamic Republic featured several key characteristics:

- A hybrid system combining theocratic elements with republican institutions
- Prioritization of Islamic jurisprudence over secular legislation
- Strong anti-imperialist foreign policy, particularly against the United States ("Great Satan") and Israel
- Export of revolutionary ideology to other Muslim societies
- Enforcement of conservative Islamic social codes

## Major Events During Leadership

Khomeini's decade as Supreme Leader was marked by tumultuous events:

- **U.S. Embassy Hostage Crisis (1979-1981)**: Revolutionary students seized the American embassy in Tehran, holding 52 Americans hostage for 444 days
- **Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988)**: Iraq under Saddam Hussein invaded Iran, leading to a devastating eight-year conflict
- **Internal Power Struggles**: Elimination of political rivals including liberals, nationalists, and leftists who had been revolutionary allies
- **Cultural Revolution**: Purging of universities and imposition of Islamic standards in education and society
- **Fatwa Against Salman Rushdie (1989)**: Shortly before his death, Khomeini issued a controversial fatwa calling for the death of author Salman Rushdie for alleged blasphemy

## Religious and Philosophical Thought

Beyond political theory, Khomeini's intellectual work spanned several domains:

- **Mysticism**: He wrote extensively on Islamic mysticism and spiritual philosophy, viewing political struggle as part of a larger spiritual journey
- **Ethics**: His work "Forty Hadiths" explored ethical dimensions of Islamic traditions
- **Jurisprudence**: He produced detailed legal rulings on ritual and social matters
- **Poetry**: He composed Persian poetry under the pen name "Hindi," revealing a more contemplative dimension

This combination of mystical insight, philosophical depth, and political radicalism made Khomeini a complex figure who defied simple categorization.

## Legacy and Influence

Khomeini died on June 3, 1989, with his funeral drawing an estimated 10 million mourners. His legacy continues to shape contemporary politics:

- **In Iran**: His political system endures under his successors, though with ongoing tensions between revolutionary ideals and pragmatic governance
- **In Shia Communities**: His elevation of clerical political authority transformed traditional quietist tendencies
- **In Sunni Political Islam**: While doctrinally different, his successful revolution inspired Islamist movements globally
- **In Western Relations**: His anti-Western stance established patterns of confrontation that continue to influence international relations

Assessments of Khomeini remain sharply divided. Supporters view him as a champion of Islamic authenticity and resistance to imperialism, while critics cite his regime's human rights abuses, suppression of dissent, and rigid implementation of religious law.
