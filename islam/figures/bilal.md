# Bilal ibn Rabah

![Bilal ibn Rabah](../../images/bilal_ibn_rabah.jpg)

Bilal ibn Rabah (580-640 CE), also known as Bilal al-Habashi, was one of the most trusted and loyal companions of Prophet Muhammad. Born into slavery in Mecca, he became one of the earliest converts to Islam and endured severe persecution for his faith. After gaining freedom, he became Islam's first muezzin (caller to prayer) and holds a distinguished place in Islamic history as a symbol of equality, perseverance, and devotion.

## Early Life and Enslavement

Bilal was born around 580 CE in Mecca. His father was an Arab slave and his mother, Hamama, was a former Abyssinian (Ethiopian) princess who had been captured and sold into slavery. Due to his lineage, Bilal is often referred to as "al-Habashi" (the Abyssinian).

He was owned by Umayyah ibn Khalaf, a wealthy and prominent Meccan who was fiercely opposed to Muhammad's message. Bilal worked as a slave in Mecca, performing various duties for his master in the harsh conditions typical of slavery in pre-Islamic Arabia.

## Conversion to Islam and Persecution

When Muhammad began preaching Islam in Mecca around 610 CE, Bilal was among the earliest converts. His acceptance of the new faith was a profound personal transformation, embracing monotheism and rejecting the polytheistic practices of his master and Meccan society.

When Umayyah discovered Bilal's conversion, he subjected him to extreme torture to force him to renounce Islam:

- He was dragged through the streets of Mecca
- He was beaten severely and regularly
- He was taken to the desert during the hottest part of the day, where a heavy rock was placed on his chest
- Despite this torture, Bilal refused to renounce his faith, repeatedly saying "Ahad, Ahad" (One, One), affirming the oneness of God

## Freedom and Life as a Muslim

Abu Bakr, one of Muhammad's closest companions and later the first caliph, was deeply moved by Bilal's suffering and steadfastness. He purchased and freed Bilal, an act that Muhammad highly commended. After gaining his freedom, Bilal became a constant companion of the Prophet.

His most significant honor came when Muhammad selected him to be the first muezzin of Islam. According to tradition, after the Muslims migrated to Medina, they discussed how to announce the times of prayer. Bilal was chosen to make the call to prayer (adhan) because of his powerful, beautiful voice. He would climb to the roof of the mosque and call the faithful to prayer five times daily.

## Role in Early Islamic History

Bilal played important roles in key events of early Islamic history:

- He participated in the major battles alongside Muhammad, including Badr, Uhud, and the conquest of Mecca
- When Muslims reconquered Mecca in 630 CE, Muhammad asked Bilal to climb on top of the Kaaba to perform the adhan, symbolically marking the triumph of Islam in the city that had once persecuted its followers
- He served as Muhammad's treasurer and personal attendant
- He was among the select companions who were with the Prophet during his final illness

## Character and Attributes

Historical accounts describe Bilal as:

- Tall and thin with a dark complexion
- Possessing a powerful and melodious voice
- Deeply devoted to Muhammad and the Islamic faith
- Humble despite his elevated status
- Steadfast in the face of persecution
- Meticulous and trustworthy in his responsibilities

## Life After Muhammad's Death

After Muhammad's death in 632 CE, Bilal was deeply affected by the loss of his beloved Prophet. According to tradition, he found it emotionally difficult to make the call to prayer without Muhammad being present to hear it.

During Abu Bakr's caliphate, Bilal asked permission to leave Medina and participate in jihad (in its meaning of striving in God's cause) in the expanding Muslim territories. He moved to Syria, where he lived until his death.

There are different accounts about when and where he performed the adhan after Muhammad's death. Some traditions say he refrained entirely, while others mention that he made the call to prayer when Caliph Umar visited Jerusalem, and on a few other significant occasions when requested by the Prophet's family.

## Death and Legacy

Bilal died in Damascus (or possibly Aleppo) around 640 CE, during the caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab. He was approximately 60 years old.

His legacy in Islamic history and culture is profound:
