# Muhammad in Shia Tradition

![Muhammad in Shia Islam](../../images/muhammad_shia.jpg)

The Prophet Muhammad (c. 570-632 CE) holds a position of profound reverence in Shia Islam, where he is viewed not only as the final messenger of God but also as the initiator of a divinely appointed leadership lineage through his family. The Shia perspective on Muhammad emphasizes his role in establishing the Imamate and preserves distinctive narratives about his life, teachings, and intentions that differ in certain respects from Sunni traditions.

## The Infallible Prophet

Shia Islam considers Muhammad to be ma'sum (infallible), meaning:

- Protected from sin (both major and minor)
- Preserved from error in matters of religious teaching
- Guided by divine wisdom in all aspects of leadership
- Possessing perfect knowledge bestowed by God
- Exemplifying the ideal of human spiritual attainment

This concept of infallibility extends to the Imams who succeeded him, beginning with Ali ibn Abi Talib, creating a continuous line of divinely protected religious authority.

## Designation of Ali

Central to Shia understanding of Muhammad's mission is the event of Ghadir Khumm, which occurred shortly before the Prophet's death. According to Shia sources:

- Muhammad stopped at Ghadir Khumm with thousands of returning pilgrims
- He delivered a sermon emphasizing the weight of the "two trusts" he was leaving: the Quran and his family (Ahl al-Bayt)
- He raised Ali's hand declaring, "For whomever I am their mawla (master/guardian), Ali is their mawla"
- He received the final Quranic revelation affirming the completion of religion (5:3)

Shias interpret this event as Muhammad's explicit designation (nass) of Ali as his successor in both temporal and spiritual authority, implementing a divine command.

## The Ahl al-Bayt

In Shia tradition, Muhammad's emphasis on his family (Ahl al-Bayt) represents a cornerstone of his prophethood:

- He frequently highlighted their special status and purity
- The "Verse of Purification" (33:33) is understood to refer specifically to Muhammad, Ali, Fatimah, Hassan, and Hussein
- He compared his family to Noah's Arkâ€”those who board it will be saved
- The Tradition of the Cloak (Hadith al-Kisa) shows his special relationship with the five purified ones
- He established the principle that love for his family is obligatory for believers

Shia Muslims believe Muhammad intended his family to serve as guides, interpreters of revelation, and spiritual authorities after his death.

## Foresight of Future Events

Shia tradition maintains that Muhammad was given knowledge of future events affecting his community, including:

- The martyrdom of Hussein at Karbala, which caused him great distress
- The usurpation of leadership from Ali and subsequent tribulations
- The sufferings that would befall his daughter Fatimah after his death
- The sequence of twelve Imams who would succeed him
- The occultation of the twelfth Imam and his eventual return

This foreknowledge is seen as part of the burden of prophethood that Muhammad carried, knowing the trials his family and true followers would face.

## Distinctive Narrations

Shia collections of hadith preserve numerous traditions about Muhammad that are either absent from or given less prominence in Sunni sources:

- His repeated statements about Ali's status as his successor
- More extensive accounts of his special relationship with Fatimah
- Traditions emphasizing the elevated status of the Ahl al-Bayt
- Narratives about specific opponents who would later betray his wishes
- Different accounts of certain historical events like the incident of "pen and paper" on his deathbed

Shia religious authorities apply strict criteria in authenticating hadith, with emphasis on narrations coming through the Imams from the Prophet's household.

## Commemorative Practices

Shia Muslims commemorate Muhammad in distinctive ways:

- Special observances on his birthday (Mawlid an-Nabi) and death anniversary
- Recitation of the Ziyarat Ashura, which begins by sending greetings to the Prophet
- Poems and elegies emphasizing his sorrow over his grandson's martyrdom
- Regular invocations of blessings upon Muhammad and his family in prayer and daily life
- Pilgrimage rituals to his tomb that include specific supplications recognizing his appointed successors
