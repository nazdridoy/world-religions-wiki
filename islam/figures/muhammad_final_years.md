# Final Years of Prophet Muhammad

![Prophet Muhammad's Final Years](../../images/muhammad_final_years.jpg)

The final years of Prophet Muhammad's life (628-632 CE) represent a pivotal period in Islamic history, marked by the consolidation of the Muslim community, major diplomatic achievements, military victories, and the establishment of Islam as the dominant religion in the Arabian Peninsula. These years witnessed the transition from a period of struggle to one of triumph, and ultimately culminated in the Prophet's farewell pilgrimage and his passing.

## Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (628 CE)

In the sixth year after the Hijra, Muhammad led approximately 1,400 Muslims toward Mecca to perform the Umrah (lesser pilgrimage). When they reached Hudaybiyyah on the outskirts of Mecca, the Quraysh blocked their entry. After negotiations, both parties agreed to a treaty that:

- Established a ten-year peace between Muslims and the Quraysh
- Allowed Muslims to return the following year for pilgrimage
- Permitted tribes to freely ally themselves with either the Muslims or the Quraysh
- Required the Muslims to return to Medina without completing the pilgrimage that year

Initially appearing as a setback to some companions, the treaty proved strategically advantageous, creating a peaceful environment that enabled the rapid spread of Islam. The Quran referred to it as a "clear victory" (48:1), and within two years, the Muslim community had doubled in size.

## Letters to Foreign Rulers (628-629 CE)

Following the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, Muhammad initiated a diplomatic campaign by sending letters to major rulers of the time, including:

- Heraclius, the Byzantine Emperor
- Khosrow II, the Sassanid Emperor
- Negus of Abyssinia
- Muqawqis, the ruler of Egypt
- Various tribal leaders in Arabia

These letters invited the rulers to accept Islam and acknowledge Muhammad's prophethood. While responses varied from respectful consideration to outright rejection, this initiative positioned Islam as a religion with universal aspirations.

## Conquest of Mecca (630 CE)

When the Quraysh and their allies violated the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah by attacking a tribe allied with the Muslims, Muhammad mobilized an army of 10,000 and marched on Mecca. The overwhelming force led to a nearly bloodless conquest as the Quraysh surrendered without significant resistance.

Upon entering Mecca, Muhammad:
- Declared a general amnesty for the Meccans, sparing even former enemies
- Destroyed the idols in and around the Kaaba, restoring it to monotheistic worship
- Delivered a sermon emphasizing human equality and brotherhood
- Received the allegiance of the Meccan leadership

This event marked a decisive turning point, as the city that had once persecuted Muhammad and his followers now became the spiritual center of Islam.

## Battle of Hunayn and Siege of Ta'if (630 CE)

Shortly after Mecca's conquest, Muhammad faced a coalition of Hawazin and Thaqif tribes at Hunayn. Despite initial setbacks, the Muslims ultimately prevailed. Following this victory, they laid siege to Ta'if, a stronghold of resistance, though Muhammad eventually lifted the siege and returned to Medina, with Ta'if later voluntarily accepting Islam.

## Year of Delegations (630-631 CE)

The ninth year after Hijra is known as the "Year of Delegations" (Aam al-Wufud), when numerous tribal delegations from across Arabia traveled to Medina to pledge allegiance to Muhammad and accept Islam. This period saw the rapid Islamization of the Arabian Peninsula, with tribes sending representatives to learn about the new faith and establish political ties with the emerging Islamic state.

## Tabuk Expedition (631 CE)

Muhammad led his largest military expedition to Tabuk, near the Byzantine border, in response to rumors of a Byzantine invasion. Though no battle occurred as the Byzantine forces did not materialize, the campaign demonstrated the Muslims' military capabilities and secured their northern frontier. This expedition also revealed the existence of "hypocrites" (munafiqun) in Medina who were reluctant to join the difficult campaign.

## Farewell Pilgrimage (632 CE)

In the tenth year after Hijra, Muhammad performed his first and only complete Hajj, known as the Farewell Pilgrimage (Hajjat al-Wada). During this pilgrimage:

- He established the rituals of Hajj that Muslims continue to follow today
- He delivered his famous Farewell Sermon at Mount Arafat, emphasizing:
  - The sanctity of human life and property
  - The equality of all humans regardless of race
  - The rights of women
  - The abolition of pre-Islamic blood feuds and usury
  - The importance of adhering to the Quran and his teachings

The sermon concluded with the revelation of what is believed to be one of the final verses of the Quran: "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion" (5:3).

## Illness and Death (632 CE)

Shortly after returning to Medina, Muhammad fell ill with a fever and severe headaches. Key events during his final days included:

- He continued to lead prayers when possible, but eventually appointed Abu Bakr to lead in his stead
- He freed his slaves and distributed his remaining possessions to the poor
- He offered his final counsels to the Muslim community
- He emphasized the importance of prayer and proper treatment of the vulnerable

Muhammad passed away on the 12th of Rabi al-Awwal (June 8, 632 CE) with his head resting in the lap of his wife Aisha. His death triggered a crisis among the companions, with Umar initially refusing to accept the news. Abu Bakr confirmed the Prophet's passing with the famous words: "Whoever worshipped Muhammad, know that Muhammad has died. But whoever worships Allah, know that Allah is Ever-Living and shall never die."

The Prophet was buried in the room where he died, which is now enclosed within the Prophet's Mosque (Masjid an-Nabawi) in Medina.

## Legacy and Succession

Muhammad left behind no explicit instructions regarding political succession, leading to a momentous gathering at Saqifah where, after debate, Abu Bakr was selected as the first caliph. This decision would have profound implications for the future of the Muslim community and would eventually lead to the Sunni-Shia schism.

The Prophet's legacy, however, transcended political questions. He left behind:
- The Quran, believed by Muslims to be the verbatim word of God
- His Sunnah (practices and sayings) that would form the second source of Islamic law
- A unified Arabian Peninsula under the banner of Islam
- A community poised to expand rapidly beyond Arabia
