Abdullah ibn Abbas (619-687 CE), often referred to as Ibn Abbas, was a paternal cousin of Prophet Muhammad and one of the most knowledgeable scholars among the companions. Revered as "the learned man of the ummah" and "the interpreter of the Quran," Ibn Abbas laid the foundation for Quranic exegesis (tafsir) and played a crucial role in preserving and transmitting Islamic knowledge in the early decades after Muhammad's death.

## Early Life and Family

Ibn Abbas was born in Mecca approximately three years before the Hijra (migration to Medina), making him around 13-14 years old when Prophet Muhammad died. He was the son of Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, the Prophet's uncle, and Umm al-Fadl Lubaba bint al-Harith, making him a member of the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe.

His family connections were significant:
- Paternal cousin of Prophet Muhammad
- Son of Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, progenitor of the Abbasid dynasty
- Brother of Fadl ibn Abbas, another companion of Muhammad
- Nephew of Maymunah bint al-Harith, one of Muhammad's wives

As a young boy, Ibn Abbas was close to the Prophet, who is reported to have made special prayers for him, saying: "O Allah, give him understanding of the religion and teach him interpretation."

## Education and Knowledge

Despite his youth during Muhammad's lifetime, Ibn Abbas became one of the most knowledgeable companions due to several factors:

- He actively sought knowledge from senior companions after Muhammad's death

Ibn Abbas's methodology for interpreting the Quran included:
1. Understanding the Quran through other parts of the Quran
2. Seeking explanations from the Prophet's traditions
3. Consulting the understanding of senior companions
4. Analyzing the linguistic aspects using his knowledge of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry
5. Considering the historical context of revelation
