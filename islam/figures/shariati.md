# Ali Shariati

![Ali Shariati](../../images/shariati.jpg)

Ali Shariati (1933-1977) was an influential Iranian sociologist, philosopher, and revolutionary thinker whose synthesis of Islamic principles with Western critical theory and Third World liberation ideology profoundly shaped Iran's intellectual landscape before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Often called the "Ideologue of the Iranian Revolution," Shariati articulated a revolutionary interpretation of Shi'a Islam that mobilized religious symbolism for social and political transformation. His ideas continue to influence Islamic reform movements, liberation theology, and political discourse in the Muslim world and beyond.

## Early Life and Education

Born on November 24, 1933, in Mazinan, a small village near Sabzevar, Iran, Ali Shariati grew up in a family with deep religious roots and reformist tendencies. His father, Muhammad-Taqi Shariati, was a religious scholar who established the "Center for the Propagation of Islamic Truths" in Mashhad, challenging both traditional clerical interpretations of Islam and secularist narratives.

Shariati's formal education began in Mashhad, where he attended both religious and modern schools. He subsequently studied at the Teachers' Training College and began teaching while becoming involved in nationalist politics during the tumultuous era of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh's government and its overthrow in a CIA-backed coup in 1953.

In 1959, Shariati's academic excellence earned him a scholarship to continue his education in France. At the University of Paris (Sorbonne), he studied sociology and history of religions under prominent scholars like Louis Massignon, Georges Gurvitch, and Jacques Berque. During this formative period in Paris (1959-1964), he immersed himself in Western intellectual traditions—including existentialism, Marxism, and phenomenology—while also connecting with anti-colonial thinkers and movements. He translated works by Frantz Fanon and Che Guevara into Persian and became active in the Iranian student movement abroad.

## Return to Iran and Academic Career

Upon returning to Iran in 1964, Shariati was immediately imprisoned for his political activities abroad. After his release, he began teaching at the University of Mashhad but faced ongoing harassment from the Shah's regime for his increasingly popular lectures that blended religious rhetoric with revolutionary ideas. His academic career oscillated between periods of teaching and government-imposed silence.

The turning point in Shariati's public influence came when he began lecturing at the Hosseinieh Ershad, a modern religious institute in Tehran, between 1969 and 1972. These electrifying lectures, attended by thousands of young Iranians, transformed Islamic discourse in Iran by reinterpreting traditional religious concepts through contemporary sociological, philosophical, and revolutionary frameworks. When the government closed the Hosseinieh Ershad in 1972, Shariati was again imprisoned, spending eighteen months in solitary confinement.

Following international pressure, Shariati was released in 1975. Facing severe restrictions in Iran and suffering from health problems exacerbated by his imprisonment, he left for England in May 1977. Just three weeks after his arrival in Southampton, on June 19, 1977, he died under mysterious circumstances at age 44. While the official cause was listed as a heart attack, many of his supporters believe he was assassinated by SAVAK, the Shah's secret police.

## Intellectual Framework and Key Ideas

Shariati developed a distinctive intellectual system that reinterpreted Islamic concepts through the lens of modern sociology, critical theory, and revolutionary politics. His thought centered on several key themes:

### Revolutionary Shi'ism

Shariati distinguished between what he called "Safavid Shi'ism" (traditional, clerical, and politically quietist) and "Alavi Shi'ism" (dynamic, justice-oriented, and revolutionary). He presented the latter as the authentic tradition stemming from Imam Ali and Hussein, arguing that Shi'ism originated as a revolutionary movement against injustice and oppression before being co-opted by political powers and conservative clergy.

His reinterpretation of the martyrdom of Imam Hussein at Karbala as a paradigm of revolutionary struggle against tyranny—rather than merely an occasion for ritual mourning—became particularly influential, transforming this central Shi'a narrative into a mobilizing symbol for contemporary political action.

### Return to Self (Bazgasht be Khishtan)

Against the twin alienating forces of Western imperialism and Eastern despotism, Shariati advocated cultural authenticity and a "return to self." This did not mean rejecting all Western ideas but rather critically engaging them from a position rooted in one's own cultural tradition. He criticized both uncritical Westernization and reactionary traditionalism, seeking instead a dynamic synthesis that could enable Muslims to become active subjects of history rather than passive objects.

### Religion Against Religion

One of Shariati's most provocative concepts was "religion against religion" (din bar 'alayh-e din), which distinguished between two types of religion: the religion of legitimation that justifies oppression and the religion of liberation that fights against it. This dialectical understanding allowed him to critique religious institutions while affirming religious faith as a potential revolutionary force.

### Social Justice and Tawhid

Shariati reinterpreted tawhid (the Islamic concept of divine unity) as a worldview opposing all forms of social fragmentation, class division, and human alienation. In his framework, tawhid became not just a theological principle about God's oneness but a sociological ideal demanding social unity, economic equality, and the liberation of human potential.

### The Ideal Society

Drawing from both Islamic sources and Western sociology, Shariati outlined his vision of the ideal society as a classless social order (ummat) based on collective ownership of major resources, participatory decision-making, and a commitment to justice. This vision represented an Islamic alternative to both liberal capitalism and Soviet communism during the Cold War era.

## Literary Output

Despite his relatively short life, Shariati was extraordinarily prolific. His complete works comprise nearly 40 volumes in Persian, including:

- **Islamology (Eslamshenasi)**: His systematic attempt to reinterpret Islam as a liberation ideology
- **Return to Self (Bazgasht be Khishtan)**: Essays on cultural authenticity and decolonization
- **Hajj**: A radical reinterpretation of the pilgrimage rituals as symbols of revolutionary struggle
- **Fatima is Fatima**: A feminist reading of the Prophet's daughter as an ideal of female empowerment
- **Red Shi'ism vs. Black Shi'ism**: His distinction between revolutionary and quietist interpretations
- **Martyrdom (Shahadat)**: Analysis of martyrdom as conscious sacrifice for social transformation
- **Religion vs. Religion**: His dialectical approach to religious traditions
- **Waiting: The Religion of Protest**: Reinterpretation of the Shi'a concept of waiting for the Mahdi

These works circulated widely through both official publications and underground networks of cassette tapes, pamphlets, and mimeographed notes from his lectures.

## Influence and Legacy

Shariati's influence spans multiple dimensions:

### Pre-Revolutionary Iran

His reinterpretation of Shi'a symbolism and rituals provided an ideological framework that mobilized traditional religious segments of Iranian society—particularly the youth, students, and middle class—against the Shah's regime. His ideas helped bridge the gap between secular leftist intellectuals and religious forces in the revolutionary coalition.

### Post-Revolutionary Iran

After the 1979 revolution, different factions claimed Shariati's legacy. While the Islamic Republic incorporated aspects of his rhetoric, many of his followers argue that the clerical state that emerged was precisely the form of institutionalized religion he had criticized. His vision of Islamic liberation without clerical domination made him both useful and problematic for the new establishment.

### Global Islamic Thought

Beyond Iran, Shariati's methodology of reinterpreting Islamic concepts through contemporary theoretical frameworks influenced Islamic thinkers across the Muslim world. His work represents one of the most sophisticated attempts to articulate an indigenous Islamic path to modernity that neither rejects the tradition nor surrenders to Western paradigms.

### Liberation Theology

Although emerging from different contexts, Shariati's work shares remarkable parallels with Latin American liberation theology. His articulation of religion as a force for social justice and liberation from oppression continues to resonate with progressive religious movements globally.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Shariati's work has generated significant debate and criticism from multiple perspectives:

- **Traditional Clerics**: Many ulama criticized his non-clerical interpretation of Islam and his selective reading of religious texts without formal theological training.

- **Secular Intellectuals**: Some secular thinkers viewed his religious framing as ultimately reinforcing theological authority despite his progressive politics.

- **Marxists**: Orthodox Marxists criticized his failure to fully embrace historical materialism and his continued emphasis on spirituality.

- **Liberals**: Liberal critics highlighted the potentially authoritarian implications of his communitarian vision and revolutionary politics.

- **Feminists**: While his work on women's issues was progressive for his context, some feminist scholars have noted limitations in his gender analysis.

Despite these criticisms, Shariati's ability to speak meaningfully to multiple audiences—religious and secular, traditional and modern, Eastern and Western—remains a testament to the depth and complexity of his thought.
