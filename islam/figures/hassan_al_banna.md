Hassan al-Banna (1906-1949) was an Egyptian religious leader, reformer, and political activist who founded the Muslim Brotherhood (al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun), one of the most influential and widespread Islamic revivalist movements of the 20th century. As an educator, organizer, and ideologue, al-Banna developed a comprehensive vision of Islamic renewal that combined religious revival with social reform, political activism, and anti-colonial resistance. His ideas and the movement he created continue to shape Islamic thought and politics throughout the Muslim world.

## Early Life and Education

Born in Mahmoudiyah, a rural town in the Nile Delta of Egypt:

- Son of Sheikh Ahmad al-Banna, a respected local imam and scholar who authored books on Islamic tradition
- Received traditional religious education alongside modern schooling
- Memorized the Quran at an early age and showed exceptional intellectual ability
- Became involved with religious societies and Sufi orders during his youth
- Deeply affected by the social and political turmoil in Egypt following World War I
- Trained as a teacher at Dar al-Ulum in Cairo, graduating in 1927
- Disturbed by the growing Western influence and perceived moral decline in Egyptian society
- Directly witnessed British colonial control and its impact on Egyptian life and culture

His formative experiences combined traditional Islamic learning with exposure to modern institutions, creating the foundation for his later synthesis of tradition and modernity.

## Founding the Muslim Brotherhood

In 1928, while working as a schoolteacher in Ismailiyya, al-Banna established the Muslim Brotherhood:

- Initially began with six workers from the Suez Canal Company who approached him for religious guidance
- Started as a religious society focused on moral reform and Islamic education
- Developed an organizational structure combining elements of modern associations with Islamic principles
- Created a multi-tiered membership system with different levels of commitment and responsibility
- Established a newspaper, social services, businesses, and schools under Brotherhood supervision
- Expanded rapidly throughout Egypt, reaching hundreds of branches within a decade
- Developed specialized sections for students, professionals, workers, and other social groups
- Created a paramilitary wing called the "Special Apparatus" (al-Nizam al-Khass) for self-defense and later militant activities

The Brotherhood's growth represented one of the first successful mass Islamic movements that effectively mobilized people across social classes.

## Ideology and Vision

Al-Banna formulated a comprehensive ideology that addressed religious, social, and political dimensions:

### Islamic Revival

- Called for a return to authentic Islam based on the Quran and Sunnah
- Advocated a middle path between rigid conservatism and uncritical Westernization
- Emphasized the comprehensive nature of Islam as a complete system for all aspects of life
- Rejected the separation of religion from politics, economics, or social affairs
- Criticized both traditional religious scholars for isolation and Westernized elites for abandoning Islamic values

### Social Reform

- Established schools, clinics, charitable organizations, and economic enterprises
- Emphasized the importance of education and moral training
- Promoted Islamic social ethics and family values
- Addressed issues of poverty, illiteracy, and public health
- Developed a model of Islamic social welfare as an alternative to secular models

### Political Vision

- Called for gradual Islamization of society and government
- Opposed British colonialism and worked for Egyptian independence
- Rejected both Western capitalism and Soviet communism as foreign ideologies
- Advocated pan-Islamic unity against colonial powers
- Envisioned the eventual establishment of an Islamic state implementing sharia
- Developed a staged approach to political change beginning with individual reform

## Methods and Approach

Al-Banna developed distinctive methods for achieving his vision:

- Emphasized gradual change rather than revolutionary upheaval
- Built a comprehensive organizational structure for sustainable growth
- Combined traditional religious concepts with modern organizational techniques
- Used modern media, publications, and communication strategies
- Created a systematic program for cultivating committed members through religious education
- Deployed flexible tactics depending on political circumstances, from electoral participation to more confrontational approaches
- Balanced between engagement with the existing political system and maintaining ideological purity

His approach proved remarkably adaptable and has allowed the Brotherhood to survive despite decades of repression in many countries.

## Conflicts and Assassination

As the Brotherhood's influence grew, it increasingly came into conflict with authorities:

- Initially maintained relatively good relations with the Egyptian monarchy
- Tensions increased during World War II when the Brotherhood criticized Egyptian government policies
- The Palestine issue became a focal point for Brotherhood activism and criticism of the regime
- After the war, the Brotherhood became increasingly involved in politics and anti-colonial struggles
- Clashed with the government over Egypt's relationship with Britain and position toward Palestine
- The Special Apparatus engaged in bombings and assassination attempts against British installations and Egyptian officials
- The Egyptian government dissolved the Brotherhood in December 1948
- Hassan al-Banna was assassinated on February 12, 1949, likely by government agents, though the case was never officially solved

His assassination at age 43 made him a martyr figure for the movement, but his organizational foundation proved durable enough to survive his death.

## Legacy and Influence

Al-Banna's impact has been profound and far-reaching:

- The Muslim Brotherhood became the prototype for Islamic activist movements worldwide
- His ideas influenced later Islamist thinkers including Sayyid Qutb, though many took his ideas in more radical directions
- The Brotherhood model spread throughout the Arab world and beyond
- His organizational methods have been adopted by diverse Islamic movements
- His emphasis on comprehensive reform influenced Islamic activism for generations
- His movement has produced both moderate Islamic democratic parties and, indirectly, more radical offshoots
- Brotherhood-inspired groups have participated in electoral politics in numerous countries
- His approach to Islamic revival as comprehensive social, political, and spiritual reform remains influential

The tension between the Brotherhood's reformist and revolutionary tendencies has led to diverse interpretations of al-Banna's legacy, with different factions emphasizing different aspects of his thought.

## Major Writings

Al-Banna was not a prolific author but produced influential works:

- **Mudhakkirat al-Da'wa wal-Da'iya** (Memoirs of the Call and the Caller) - Autobiographical reflections
- **Risalat al-Ta'alim** (Epistle of Teachings) - Core doctrines for Brotherhood members
- **Rasail** (Letters/Messages) - Collection of essays addressing various aspects of Islamic revival
- Numerous articles in Brotherhood publications
- Speeches and lectures widely circulated among followers

His writing style was practical and accessible rather than theoretical, focusing on mobilizing followers for action.
