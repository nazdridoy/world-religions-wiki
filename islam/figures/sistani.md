Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali al-Husayni al-Sistani (born 1930) is one of the most influential Shia Muslim clerics in the world and the preeminent marja' taqlid (source of emulation) for millions of Twelver Shia Muslims globally. Based in Najaf, Iraq, Sistani has played a critical role in shaping post-Saddam Iraq's political landscape while adhering to a tradition of quietist clerical involvement in politics that differs from Iran's more interventionist model of governance.

## Early Life and Education

Born in Mashhad, Iran, to a family of religious scholars, Sistani began his religious education at a young age. He moved to Qom to continue his studies before relocating to Najaf, Iraq, in 1951, where he studied under Grand Ayatollah Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei. Following Khoei's death in 1992, Sistani gradually emerged as his successor, despite Saddam Hussein's persecution of Shia clerics during that period.

## Religious Authority

### Marja øiyya

Sistani occupies the position of highest authority in the Shia clerical establishment. His status as a marja' taqlid means that millions of Shia Muslims follow his juridical rulings in matters of religious practice and daily life. His religious opinions (fatwas) and legal rulings are considered binding for his followers.

### Scholarly Approach

Known for his moderate views and traditional methodology, Sistani adheres to a scholarly approach that emphasizes rigorous textual analysis and cautious juridical reasoning. He has authored numerous books on Islamic law, rituals, and practice that are studied throughout the Shia world.

## Political Influence

### Post-Saddam Iraq

After the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and the fall of Saddam Hussein, Sistani emerged as a stabilizing force in a country threatened by sectarian violence and political chaos. He:

- Called for direct elections when the U.S. proposed appointed governance
- Urged Iraqis to participate in the democratic process
- Consistently advocated for national unity across sectarian lines
- Issued fatwas against sectarian violence

### Quietist Tradition

Sistani represents the "quietist" tradition in Shia Islam, which holds that clerics should advise on matters of governance but not directly rule. This stands in contrast to the Khomeinist doctrine of wilayat al-faqih (guardianship of the jurist) practiced in Iran, where the supreme leader has direct political authority.

## Crisis Intervention

In 2014, when ISIS threatened Iraq, Sistani issued a fatwa calling for Iraqis to defend their country, which mobilized thousands of volunteers to join the fight against the terrorist organization. This rare direct call to action demonstrated his willingness to intervene in moments of existential crisis.

Similarly, during the 2019-2020 Iraqi protests, his statements supporting demonstrators' legitimate demands while calling for nonviolence significantly influenced the political response.

## Interfaith Relations

Sistani has promoted interfaith dialogue and peaceful coexistence. His historic 2021 meeting with Pope Francis in Najaf marked a significant moment in Muslim-Christian relations. During this meeting, they discussed the importance of religious leaders working together to promote peace and protect religious minorities.

## Charitable Network

The Sistani establishment oversees an extensive network of charitable organizations, religious schools, hospitals, and social services throughout Iraq and beyond. These institutions serve millions of people regardless of religious affiliation.
