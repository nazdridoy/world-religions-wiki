Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (682-720 CE), also known as Umar II, was the eighth Umayyad caliph who ruled from 717 to 720 CE. Despite his brief reign of only two and a half years, he is widely regarded as one of the finest Muslim rulers and is sometimes referred to as the fifth rightly-guided (Rashidun) caliph for his justice, piety, and reforms. His rule represented a significant departure from the policies of previous Umayyad caliphs and an attempt to align the caliphate more closely with Islamic principles of justice and equality.

## Early Life and Background

Born in Medina to Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan (governor of Egypt and brother of Caliph Abd al-Malik) and Umm Asim bint Asim ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab (a granddaughter of the second caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab), Umar II had lineage connecting him to both the Umayyad dynasty and the family of the second caliph.

He received an excellent education in Medina, studying under some of the most prominent scholars of the time, including the jurist Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib. Growing up in Medina rather than Damascus (the Umayyad capital) exposed him to the traditions and teachings of the Prophet's city, which significantly influenced his religious outlook and political philosophy.

Before becoming caliph, Umar served as the governor of Medina under his cousin, Caliph Al-Walid I (705-715 CE). During this time, he gained administrative experience while developing a reputation for fairness and piety.

## Accession to the Caliphate

Following the death of Caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik in 717 CE, Umar unexpectedly became caliph. According to historical accounts, Sulayman had been impressed by Umar's piety and justice, and on his deathbed, changed his succession plan to name Umar as his successor instead of his own sons.

Upon becoming caliph, Umar's lifestyle changed dramatically. He immediately returned excess wealth from the treasury to the public, gave away his personal luxuries, and adopted a simple lifestyle that contrasted sharply with the imperial grandeur of previous Umayyad caliphs.

## Reforms and Policies

Umar II's reign was characterized by significant reforms intended to correct what he saw as deviations from Islamic principles in the governance of the expanding Muslim empire:

### Administrative and Fiscal Reforms

- Abolished the practice of cursing Ali ibn Abi Talib in Friday sermons, ending an Umayyad political tradition
- Removed unjust taxes (mukus) on non-Arabs and new converts to Islam
- Stopped the practice of confiscating property from non-Muslims
- Equalized stipends between Arab and non-Arab Muslims
- Returned properties unjustly confiscated by previous administrations
- Instituted strict accountability for governors and officials

### Religious and Social Policies

- Emphasized religious learning and scholarship across the empire
- Appointed pious and knowledgeable individuals to government positions
- Sent teachers to distant provinces to educate people about Islam
- Promoted humane treatment of non-Muslim subjects
- Encouraged fair treatment of new converts to Islam
- Implemented public welfare initiatives, including support for orphans and the poor

### Military and Expansion Policies

- Ordered the withdrawal of the ongoing siege of Constantinople
- Focused on consolidation rather than expansion of the empire
- Improved conditions for soldiers and their families
- Ordered armies to avoid destruction of agricultural lands

## Legacy and Impact

Though his reign was brief, Umar II's impact on Islamic history was profound:

- He is often regarded as a model of Islamic leadership and is celebrated for his attempt to align the caliphate with Islamic principles
- His reforms significantly improved the condition of non-Arab Muslims and non-Muslim subjects
- He temporarily slowed the decline of the Umayyad dynasty by addressing systemic injustices
- His policies influenced later Islamic governance models, particularly regarding just rulership
- Many of his administrative reforms survived beyond his reign, even as subsequent caliphs returned to more traditional Umayyad policies

His death in 720 CE at the age of 37 (possibly by poisoning, according to some accounts) cut short what many historians regard as a promising attempt at reform within the Umayyad system. After his death, many of his reforms were reversed by his successors, though his reputation for justice and piety endured.

## Historical Assessment

Both Sunni and Shia historical traditions generally hold Umar II in high regard. He is often described as a just ruler who sought to bridge the growing divides within the Muslim community. His attempts to rectify the injustices of previous Umayyad rulers have earned him a unique place in Islamic historical memoryâ€”an Umayyad ruler respected even by those generally critical of the dynasty.

The prominent historian Ibn Kathir referred to him as the fifth rightly-guided caliph, placing him in the esteemed company of Abu Bakr, Umar ibn al-Khattab, Uthman ibn Affan, and Ali ibn Abi Talib. This assessment reflects the high regard in which he was held by subsequent generations of Muslims.
