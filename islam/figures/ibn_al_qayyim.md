![Ibn al-Qayyim](../../images/ibn_al_qayyim.jpg)

Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (1292-1350 CE), fully named Shams al-Din Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr ibn Ayyub ibn Sa'd al-Zur'i al-Dimashqi, was a prominent Islamic scholar, theologian, jurist, and spiritual writer of the Hanbali school. A principal student of Ibn Taymiyyah, he was instrumental in spreading his teacher's ideas while developing his own intellectual contributions. Known for his encyclopedic knowledge, prolific writing, and nuanced approach to religious questions, Ibn al-Qayyim remains one of the most influential figures in Islamic thought, particularly in the Salafi tradition.

## Life and Education

Born in Damascus in 1292 CE (691 AH) during the Mamluk era, Ibn al-Qayyim grew up in a family connected to Islamic scholarship. His father was the superintendent (qayyim) of the Jawziyya school, from which Ibn al-Qayyim derived his name.

His intellectual formation included:

- Early education in traditional Islamic sciences in Damascus, one of the centers of learning in the Muslim world
- Study under numerous scholars including his father, Ibn 'Abd al-Da'im, and Ibn Taymiyyah
- Mastery of Arabic language, Quranic exegesis, hadith, jurisprudence, theology, and philosophy
- Special focus on hadith sciences and comparative jurisprudence

The defining relationship of his scholarly life was with Ibn Taymiyyah, whom he met around 1312 CE and accompanied for the next fifteen years until the latter's death in 1328 CE. During this period, he shared in Ibn Taymiyyah's struggles, including imprisonment for their theological positions that challenged prevailing orthodoxies.

After Ibn Taymiyyah's death, Ibn al-Qayyim continued teaching at institutions including the Sadriyya school in Damascus and the Umayyad Mosque. He faced persecution and was imprisoned alongside Ibn Taymiyyah for their opposition to certain practices they considered innovations (bid'ah). He died in Damascus in 1350 CE (751 AH) and was buried at the Bab al-Saghir cemetery.

## Intellectual Contributions

Ibn al-Qayyim's thought spans multiple disciplines, making original contributions while often synthesizing and systematizing the ideas of his teacher, Ibn Taymiyyah:

### Theology and Religious Reform

In theological matters, Ibn al-Qayyim advocated a return to scriptural sources while emphasizing rational understanding:

- Promoted strict monotheism (tawhid) and fought against what he viewed as polytheistic practices
- Defended the literal understanding of divine attributes while avoiding anthropomorphism
- Criticized excessive veneration of saints and visits to tombs
- Developed a sophisticated critique of theological determinism while affirming divine predestination
- Argued against uncritical adherence to legal schools (taqlid) in favor of independent reasoning based on textual evidence
- Articulated a middle position between pure literalism and excessive metaphorical interpretation

His theological work is characterized by a methodical, evidence-based approach that attempts to balance revelation and reason.

### Jurisprudence and Legal Theory

In jurisprudence, Ibn al-Qayyim made significant contributions to legal theory (usul al-fiqh) and practical application:

- Emphasized the principles of public interest (maslaha) and the changing nature of legal rulings based on time, place, and circumstance
- Advocated for a contextualized understanding of Islamic law that considers the underlying purposes (maqasid) of Sharia
- Argued that legal rulings should change with changing customs and circumstances
- Developed a sophisticated understanding of legal stratagems (hiyal) and their validity or invalidity
- Advanced the concept that Islamic law aims at securing benefits and preventing harm
- Critiqued rigid formalism in favor of a more flexible approach guided by scriptural principles

His legal approach is encapsulated in his famous statement: "The foundations of the Sharia are wisdom and the welfare of people in this world and the Hereafter."

### Psychology and Spirituality

Perhaps his most enduring contribution lies in the field of Islamic spirituality and psychology, where he developed a sophisticated understanding of the human soul and its spiritual development:

- Elaborated a detailed classification of the soul (nafs) and its states
- Analyzed spiritual diseases and their remedies
- Proposed a comprehensive system of spiritual purification
- Reconciled the apparent tension between spirituality and adherence to religious law
- Critiqued aspects of Sufi practice while incorporating authentic spiritual insights
- Developed a rational yet deeply spiritual approach to worship and devotion
- Emphasized the relationship between faith and action, belief and practice

His approach to spirituality was firmly grounded in scripture while being psychologically insightful and practically oriented.

### Medicine and Natural Sciences

Ibn al-Qayyim also made contributions to medicine and natural sciences:

- Wrote on prophetic medicine (al-tibb al-nabawi) and integrated it with Greek and Islamic medical knowledge
- Discussed physical and spiritual aspects of healing
- Addressed issues of public health and preventive medicine
- Demonstrated knowledge of contemporary medical practices and theories
- Applied empirical approaches to medical questions
