# Muhammad's Early Life

![Muhammad Early Life](../../images/muhammad_early_life.jpg)

Muhammad ibn Abdullah (c. 570-632 CE), the Prophet of Islam, was born in Mecca in the Year of the Elephant, named after an unsuccessful expedition by Abraha to attack the Kaaba. His early life laid the foundation for his later prophethood and established his character as a trustworthy and contemplative individual.

## Birth and Lineage

Muhammad was born into the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe, the most powerful tribe in Mecca. His lineage was prestigious:

- His father, Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib, died before Muhammad's birth
- His mother, Amina bint Wahb, was from the Banu Zuhra clan
- His grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, was a prominent leader of Mecca and custodian of the Kaaba

Muhammad's noble lineage traced back to Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) through his son Ismail (Ishmael), according to Islamic tradition. This connection would later be significant in his establishment of Islam as a continuation of the Abrahamic monotheistic tradition.

## Childhood and Upbringing

Muhammad's early years were marked by personal loss:

- He was born an orphan (as his father had died)
- His mother Amina died when he was six years old
- His grandfather Abd al-Muttalib, who had taken guardianship after his mother's death, died when Muhammad was eight

After these losses, Muhammad came under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, who remained his protector until late in Muhammad's adult life. Despite being from a noble family, Muhammad experienced modest circumstances:

- He worked as a shepherd in his youth, tending to the flocks of Meccans
- He accompanied his uncle on trading journeys to Syria, gaining exposure to different cultures and religious traditions
- He lived through the difficult socioeconomic conditions of Meccan society, developing empathy for the marginalized

## Character Development

Even before receiving revelation, Muhammad was known for his exceptional character:

- He earned the title "al-Amin" (the Trustworthy) among the Meccans
- He was known for his truthfulness, honesty, and fair dealing in business matters
- He avoided the prevalent idolatry and immoral practices of pre-Islamic Meccan society
- He participated in the "Hilf al-Fudul" (Pact of the Virtuous), an alliance formed to protect the rights of the weak and oppressed

## Marriage to Khadijah

A significant turning point in Muhammad's early life was his marriage to Khadijah bint Khuwaylid when he was 25 (she was 40):

- Khadijah was a wealthy businesswoman who hired Muhammad to manage her trade caravans
- Impressed by his honesty and character, she proposed marriage to him
- Their marriage lasted 25 years until her death, and during this time Muhammad did not take other wives
- Khadijah provided emotional and financial support, allowing Muhammad time for contemplation
- She bore him several children, including Fatimah, the only child to give him descendants

## Spiritual Inclinations

Prior to receiving revelation, Muhammad showed spiritual tendencies:

- He frequently retreated to the Cave of Hira for meditation and contemplation
- He was dissatisfied with the idolatry and moral decay of Meccan society
- He was known to contemplate deeply about existence and creation
- He was exposed to monotheistic ideas from the Hanifs, Jews, and Christians in the region

These early years of reflection and moral development prepared Muhammad for his later role as a prophet and established his credibility among those who knew him well.
