# Muhammad's Prophethood

![Muhammad as Prophet](../../images/muhammad_prophet.jpg)

Muhammad ibn Abdullah (c. 570-632 CE) is revered in Islam as the final prophet and messenger of God (Allah). His prophethood represents the culmination of divine revelation in Islamic theology and forms the foundation of Islamic religious practice, belief, and law. Muslims believe that through Muhammad, God revealed the Quran, the unchangeable and final scripture.

## The Call to Prophethood

Muhammad was forty years old when he received his first revelation in the cave of Hira near Mecca:

- The archangel Gabriel (Jibril) appeared to Muhammad during his spiritual retreat
- The first revelation began with the command "Read!" (Iqra), opening Surah Al-Alaq
- Initially frightened by the experience, Muhammad was comforted by his wife Khadijah
- Revelations continued intermittently for 23 years until shortly before his death

This initial experience, known as the "Night of Power" (Laylat al-Qadr), marks the beginning of Muhammad's prophethood and the birth of Islam as a religion.

## The Nature of Revelation

Islamic tradition describes several ways Muhammad received divine revelations:

- Through the angel Gabriel, who sometimes appeared in human form
- As the sound of a bell that would gradually form into comprehensible words
- Direct divine communication without intermediaries
- Through true dreams (particularly in the early period)

These revelations would often occur unexpectedly and were physically demanding, with observers noting that Muhammad would sweat profusely even on cold days during revelation.

## Muhammad's Prophetic Mission

Muhammad's mission as a prophet involved several dimensions:

- **Monotheism**: Calling people to worship one God and reject idolatry
- **Moral Reform**: Establishing ethical principles and social justice
- **Community Building**: Creating a society based on faith and righteousness
- **Legal Framework**: Communicating divine laws and guidance for human affairs
- **Completion**: Finalizing the message sent through previous prophets

Muhammad did not claim to found a new religion but described himself as restoring the original monotheistic faith of Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets, purified from later corruptions.

## Signs of Prophethood

Islamic tradition identifies various signs that Muslims believe validate Muhammad's prophethood:

- **The Quran**: Considered the greatest miracle, an inimitable literary and spiritual masterpiece
- **Miracles**: Various supernatural events, including the splitting of the moon
- **Prophecies**: Predictions about future events that later came to pass
- **Personal Character**: His exemplary conduct and moral excellence
- **Rapid Spread of Islam**: The success and endurance of his message

Unlike previous prophets who were often sent to specific communities, Islamic theology holds that Muhammad was sent as a messenger to all humanity.

## The Seal of Prophethood

Muslims believe Muhammad to be the "Seal of the Prophets" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin) as mentioned in the Quran (33:40), signifying that:

- He is the final prophet in the line of Abrahamic prophets
- No new prophet will come after him
- His message is universal and eternal
- The Quran is the final revelation from God

This concept of finality is fundamental to Islamic theology and differentiates mainstream Islam from later movements that have claimed new prophetic figures.
