# Shirin Ebadi

![Shirin Ebadi](../../images/shirin_ebadi.jpg)

Shirin Ebadi (born 1947) is an Iranian lawyer, human rights activist, and the first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize (2003). As the first female judge in Iran's history before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Ebadi has devoted her career to advocating for democracy, women's rights, children's rights, and freedom of expression within the framework of Islamic law. Her work represents an important voice in the discourse on Islam, human rights, and modernity.

## Early Life and Education

Born in Hamadan, Iran to an educated family, Ebadi moved to Tehran at an early age. She pursued higher education at the University of Tehran, earning a law degree in 1969. Her academic excellence enabled her to become a judge in 1969—at just 22 years old—making her the first female judge in Iranian history. She later earned a doctorate in private law from the same university.

After a distinguished judicial career, including becoming president of Tehran's City Court, Ebadi's professional trajectory changed dramatically with the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

## Post-Revolution Challenges

Following the establishment of the Islamic Republic, Ebadi, along with other female judges, was demoted to a clerical position at the court she once presided over. The new government deemed women unsuitable to serve as judges based on their interpretation of Islamic law.

Rather than accept retirement as offered by the government, Ebadi chose to remain in the legal system, eventually gaining permission to practice as an attorney in 1992. She began taking on controversial cases that other lawyers declined, focusing particularly on:

- Defending political dissidents
- Advocating for religious minorities
- Representing families of intellectuals and journalists killed in the "Chain Murders" of 1998
- Fighting for women's and children's rights

## Human Rights Advocacy

Ebadi's approach to human rights work has been distinctive in several ways:

### Islamic Framework
Unlike some secular activists, Ebadi has consistently argued that human rights and Islam are compatible. She contends that oppressive interpretations of Islam, rather than the religion itself, are responsible for human rights violations in countries like Iran. This position gives her arguments particular resonance in Muslim-majority societies.

### Legal Focus
Her strategy centers on working within existing legal frameworks while pushing for reform, using her detailed knowledge of both Iranian and international law to identify contradictions and advocate for change.

### Institution Building
In 2001, Ebadi co-founded the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran, which provided legal representation to political prisoners and support to their families until its forced closure by the government in 2008.

### Children's Rights
She founded the Association for Support of Children's Rights in Iran and has written several books on children's rights within Islamic contexts.

## Nobel Peace Prize

In 2003, Ebadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize "for her efforts for democracy and human rights, especially the rights of women and children." The Norwegian Nobel Committee particularly noted her emphasis on the compatibility of Islam with fundamental human rights.

The award made her:
- The first Iranian to receive a Nobel Prize
- The first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
- The fifth Muslim to receive any Nobel Prize

The Iranian government's reaction to the award was mixed, with some officials congratulating her while state media downplayed or criticized the honor.

## Exile and Continued Activism

Following the disputed 2009 presidential election in Iran and subsequent Green Movement protests, Ebadi faced increasing persecution. Her husband was detained and tortured, her sister was held hostage, her assets were seized, and her Nobel Prize medal was confiscated (though later returned). While attending a conference in Spain when the crackdown intensified, Ebadi decided not to return to Iran and has lived in exile ever since.

From exile, she has continued her advocacy work by:
- Founding the Centre for Defenders of Human Rights
- Publishing books and articles on human rights in Iran
- Speaking at international forums
- Working with various international human rights organizations
- Advocating for targeted sanctions against Iranian officials responsible for human rights abuses

## Writings and Ideas

Ebadi has authored several influential books, including:
- "The Rights of the Child: A Study of Legal Aspects of Children's Rights in Iran" (1994)
- "History and Documentation of Human Rights in Iran" (2000) 
- "Iran Awakening: A Memoir of Revolution and Hope" (2006)
- "The Golden Cage: Three Brothers, Three Choices, One Destiny" (2011)
- "Until We Are Free: My Fight for Human Rights in Iran" (2016)

Her writing consistently emphasizes that:
- Islamic principles properly understood support human rights
- Cultural relativism should not be used to justify human rights violations
- Democracy and human rights must develop organically within societies rather than being imposed from outside
