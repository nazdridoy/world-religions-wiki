The physical appearance of Prophet Muhammad (570-632 CE) has been described in numerous historical accounts and hadiths. These descriptions, known as "shama'il" (features), have been carefully preserved by his companions and subsequent generations of Muslims, providing a detailed portrait of the Prophet's physical characteristics, demeanor, and personal habits.

## Historical Sources

The most authentic descriptions of the Prophet's appearance come from his companions who lived with him and observed him closely. These accounts were later compiled by scholars such as Imam al-Tirmidhi in his work "Al-Shama'il al-Muhammadiyah" (The Characteristics of Muhammad). Other sources include historical works by Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Kathir, and various collections of hadith.

## Physical Characteristics

According to authenticated narrations, Prophet Muhammad had the following physical attributes:

- **Height and Build**: He was of medium to slightly above average height with a moderate build—neither thin nor corpulent. He had broad shoulders and a strong physique.

- **Complexion**: His skin color is described as neither exceptionally white nor dark, but rather a "wheaten" color (asmar)—a light brown or olive tone that had a luminous quality. His face was described as having a radiant appearance.

- **Face**: His face was slightly round and full, with smooth skin. He had a wide forehead and well-spaced eyes.

- **Eyes**: His eyes were large and dark, with an intense gaze. The whites of his eyes had a slight reddish tint, and his eyelashes were long.

- **Nose**: His nose was slightly raised with a narrow bridge and a slight prominence in the middle.

- **Mouth and Teeth**: He had a moderately-sized mouth with well-set teeth that had small gaps between them. His smile was described as radiant.

- **Hair**: His hair was neither straight nor curly but wavy, reaching between his earlobes and shoulders. As he aged, he developed some gray hairs, particularly at his temples, but they were few in number.

- **Beard**: He maintained a full beard that he would sometimes dye with henna, giving it a reddish tint.

## The Seal of Prophethood

A distinctive physical feature mentioned in many accounts was the "Seal of Prophethood" (Khatam an-Nubuwwah), described as a raised mark or mole between his shoulder blades, approximately the size of a pigeon's egg or a small fist. This was considered a physical sign of his prophethood.

## Demeanor and Presence

Beyond mere physical features, companions often described the Prophet's presence and bearing:

- He walked with purpose, leaning slightly forward "as if descending from a height"
- When he turned to look at something, he would turn with his entire body rather than just his head
- His face was described as being like "the full moon" in its luminosity
- He maintained excellent posture and moved with deliberate, measured steps
- He was described as having a powerful presence that commanded respect, yet was approachable and humble

## Personal Habits and Hygiene

Muhammad paid careful attention to his personal appearance and hygiene:

- He regularly used miswak (tooth stick) to clean his teeth
- He applied kohl (antimony) to his eyes
- He used oil in his hair and beard
- He enjoyed perfume and encouraged its use
- He dressed simply but neatly, favoring white garments

## Artistic Representations

It is important to note that in mainstream Islamic tradition, visual depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are generally avoided to prevent idolatry. Instead, Muslims have preserved his physical description through written accounts and oral tradition. In some Islamic cultures, particularly Persian and Ottoman traditions, stylized depictions with the face veiled or as a blank luminous form have been created, but these are not intended for worship.
