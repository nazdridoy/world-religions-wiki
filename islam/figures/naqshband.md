# Bahauddin Naqshband

![Bahauddin Naqshband](../../images/naqshband.jpg)

Khwaja Bahauddin Naqshband Bukhari (1318-1389 CE) was an influential Central Asian Sufi master who founded the Naqshbandiyya, one of Islam's most widespread and enduring Sufi orders. Distinguished by its adherence to sharia, emphasis on silent dhikr (remembrance of God), and engagement with worldly affairs rather than ascetic withdrawal, the Naqshbandi order continues to exert significant spiritual and social influence across the Islamic world, from Turkey to China and Indonesia.

## Early Life and Spiritual Formation

Born in 1318 CE (718 AH) in the village of Qasr-i Hinduvan (later renamed Qasr-i Arifan) near Bukhara in present-day Uzbekistan, Bahauddin was raised in an environment steeped in Islamic learning and spirituality. According to hagiographical accounts, his spiritual potential was recognized in childhood by the prominent Khwajagan ("Masters") Sufi Muhammad Baba Sammasi, who became his first spiritual guide.

After Sammasi's death, Bahauddin's training continued under Amir Kulal, another distinguished master of the Khwajagan lineage. However, the most transformative influence on his spiritual development came through an unusual psycho-spiritual connection with Khwaja Abdul Khaliq Ghijduwani, who had lived two centuries earlier (d. 1179). Through this spiritual connection (uwaysi transmission), Bahauddin received guidance that would become foundational to his distinctive approach to Sufism.

## Spiritual Method and Teachings

The Naqshbandi path (tariqa) developed by Bahauddin is characterized by several distinctive principles:

1. **Silent Dhikr (Khafi)**: Unlike many Sufi orders that practice vocal remembrance of God, Naqshband emphasized silent, internal dhikr, considering it more profound and less susceptible to ostentation.

2. **Sobriety over Ecstasy**: He advocated spiritual sobriety (sahw) rather than ecstatic states (sukr), preferring clear consciousness in divine remembrance to emotional overwhelm.

3. **Companionship (Suhbat)**: He placed extraordinary importance on spiritual companionship and transmission from heart to heart between master and disciple.

4. **Connection with the Divine While Among Creation**: His principle of "khilwat dar anjuman" (solitude in the crowd) taught spiritual presence with God while remaining engaged in society.

5. **Adherence to the Prophetic Example (Sunnah)**: The Naqshbandi way emphasized meticulous adherence to the Prophet Muhammad's example in both outer conduct and inner states.

6. **Conscious Breathing**: The practice of "hosh dar dam" (awareness in breath) involved infusing each breath with divine remembrance.

7. **Vigilance**: "nazar bar qadam" (watching one's steps) encouraged mindfulness of one's spiritual state in every moment.

Bahauddin synthesized these principles with the earlier teachings of the Khwajagan lineage, particularly the "Eight Principles" of Abdul Khaliq Ghijduwani, creating a comprehensive spiritual methodology focused on purification of the heart and constant awareness of the divine presence.

## Historical and Social Context

Bahauddin lived during a period of political transition and cultural flourishing in Central Asia. The Mongol-founded Chagatai Khanate was giving way to the rise of Timur (Tamerlane), whose empire would soon dominate the region. Despite political upheavals, Bukhara remained a center of Islamic learning and culture.

The Naqshbandi approach reflected the social realities of this environment. Rather than withdrawing from society, Naqshband advocated engagement with the world while maintaining inner detachment—a practical spirituality suited to merchants, artisans, and even political leaders. This worldly engagement would later facilitate the order's spread along trade routes and its influence on political affairs throughout the Islamic world.

## Character and Personal Practice

Historical accounts and hagiographies describe Bahauddin as humble, generous, and rigorously dedicated to the Prophetic example. He earned his livelihood through farming and embroidery (the name "Naqshband" literally means "pattern-binder" or "embroiderer"), refusing to accept donations for spiritual teaching. This commitment to self-sufficiency through honest labor became a hallmark of the Naqshbandi order.

His personal devotional life reportedly involved intense periods of spiritual retreat balanced with community service and teaching. He advocated the "journey to the homeland" (safar dar watan)—an inner journey of self-transformation while remaining physically present in society—rather than extensive physical travels.

## Legacy and Influence

After his death in 1389 CE in Bukhara, where his shrine remains a major pilgrimage site, Bahauddin's spiritual legacy spread widely:

1. **Global Reach**: The Naqshbandiyya became one of the most geographically extensive Sufi orders, reaching from the Balkans to Indonesia and China.

2. **Political Influence**: Unlike some Sufi orders, the Naqshbandis actively engaged with rulers and political authorities, often serving as advisors and moral guides to sultans and emirs.

3. **Intellectual Development**: The order produced significant theological and literary works, with later Naqshbandi masters like Ahmad Sirhindi and Khalid Baghdadi making important contributions to Islamic thought.

4. **Revivalist Movements**: The Naqshbandi emphasis on sharia compliance and the Prophetic example made it a vehicle for religious revival and reform in many regions.

5. **Contemporary Presence**: Today, the Naqshbandiyya remains active across the Muslim world, with various branches adapting to modern contexts while maintaining core principles.

## Distinguished Successors

The Naqshbandi spiritual chain continued through notable successors including:

- **Alauddin Attar** (d. 1400): Bahauddin's immediate successor who consolidated the order
- **Yaqub Charkhi** (d. 1447): Key figure in transmitting Naqshbandi teachings

- **Khalid Baghdadi** (1779-1827): Founder of the Khalidiyya branch that spread throughout the Ottoman Empire
