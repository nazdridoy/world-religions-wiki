Yusuf al-Qaradawi (1926-2022) was an influential Egyptian Islamic theologian and scholar associated with the intellectual leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood. Known for his popular television program "Sharia and Life" on Al Jazeera and his website IslamOnline, Qaradawi became one of the most widely recognized contemporary Sunni Islamic scholars, with a global reach that extended well beyond the Arab world.

## Early Life and Education

Born in a small village in Egypt's Nile Delta in 1926, Qaradawi was orphaned at a young age. He memorized the Quran by age ten and went on to study at Al-Azhar University, the premier institution of Islamic learning in the Sunni world. During his studies, he came under the influence of Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, which would shape his ideological outlook for decades to come.

## Key Contributions and Thought

### Wasatiyya (Middle Way) Approach

Qaradawi is most famous for developing what he called the "wasatiyya" or "middle way" approach to Islam, which he presented as a moderate path between secular liberalism and radical extremism. This approach aimed to apply Islamic principles to modern life while acknowledging contemporary realities.

### Fiqh al-Aqalliyyat (Jurisprudence for Muslim Minorities)

One of Qaradawi's most significant contributions was his development of "fiqh al-aqalliyyat," a jurisprudential framework specifically for Muslims living as minorities in non-Muslim societies. This approach acknowledged the special circumstances facing Muslims in the West and provided more flexible interpretations of certain Islamic laws.

### Media Presence

Qaradawi's weekly program on Al Jazeera, "Sharia and Life," reached tens of millions of viewers across the Arabic-speaking world, giving him unparalleled influence. His ability to address contemporary issues in accessible language made him exceptionally popular among ordinary Muslims seeking guidance on modern challenges.

## Controversies

Qaradawi's positions drew both praise and criticism. He condemned the September 11 attacks and terrorism in general, but supported resistance against occupation, including suicide bombings against Israeli civilians. His views on women's rights were considered progressive within traditional frameworks but restrictive by secular standards. He was banned from entering several countries including the United States, United Kingdom, and France due to alleged extremist positions.

## Later Life and Legacy

After decades of exile in Qatar, Qaradawi briefly returned to Egypt following the 2011 Arab Spring, delivering a Friday sermon to hundreds of thousands in Tahrir Square. However, after the 2013 Egyptian coup, he was sentenced to death in absentia by an Egyptian court. 

Qaradawi died in 2022 at the age of 96 in Qatar. His legacy remains complex: to supporters, he represented a moderate, contemporary vision of Islam; to critics, his positions on certain social issues and political conflicts revealed more problematic views beneath the moderate rhetoric.
