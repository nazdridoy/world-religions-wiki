Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj al-Qushayri al-Naysaburi (c. 815-875 CE), commonly known as Imam Muslim, was one of the most distinguished and authoritative hadith scholars in Islamic history. His hadith collection, Sahih Muslim, is considered the second most authentic collection after Sahih al-Bukhari and forms one of the six canonical hadith collections in Sunni Islam.

## Life and Background

Born in Nishapur in the Khorasan region of Persia (modern-day Iran), Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj dedicated his life to the pursuit of religious knowledge, particularly the collection and authentication of the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad. Like many scholars of his time, he traveled extensively throughout the Muslim world to gather hadiths, visiting centers of learning in Iraq, the Hejaz, Egypt, and Syria.

Muslim's teacher-student relationship with Imam al-Bukhari significantly influenced his methodology in hadith criticism. Though they were contemporaries working toward similar goals, Muslim developed his own distinct approach to hadith compilation.

## Sahih Muslim

Muslim's magnum opus, "Al-Musnad Al-Sahih" (commonly known as Sahih Muslim), is a collection of 7,563 hadith (including repeated narrations) that he selected from approximately 300,000 hadiths he examined throughout his lifetime. Notable features of his collection include:

- **Rigorous Authentication**: Muslim applied strict criteria for accepting hadiths, including unbroken chains of narrators known for their integrity and accurate memory.
- **Thematic Organization**: Unlike some collections, Muslim organized hadiths by subject matter for easier reference.
- **Minimal Repetition**: Compared to al-Bukhari, Muslim tended to limit repetition of hadiths.
- **Comprehensive Chains**: For important hadiths, he often provided multiple chains of narration to strengthen their authenticity.
- **Clear Methodology**: Muslim explained his methodology in the introduction to his work.

The collection took him approximately 15 years to compile, reflecting his meticulous approach to authentication.

## Methodology and Contribution

Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj is known for his precise methodology in evaluating hadith narrators and text. Some distinctive elements of his approach include:

- **Classification System**: He developed a clear system for categorizing hadiths based on their levels of authenticity.
- **Attention to Detail**: He paid particular attention to subtle variations in wording and narration chains.
- **Critical Evaluation**: He was known for his critical faculty in examining narrators' reliability.
- **Contextual Understanding**: He considered the historical and linguistic contexts of hadiths.

Muslim's work, alongside al-Bukhari's, established the gold standard for hadith authentication, influencing all subsequent scholarship in this field.

## Other Works

Though Sahih Muslim is his most famous contribution, he authored several other works:

- **Kitab al-Tamyiz**: A work on hadith methodology
- **Kitab al-Ilal**: A study of defects in hadith
- **Kitab al-Wijdan**: On single-transmitted reports
- **Kitab al-Tabaqat**: A biographical dictionary of narrators
- **Kitab al-Afrad**: On unique narrations

Many of these works have been lost, but their titles indicate Muslim's broad engagement with hadith sciences.

## Legacy and Influence

Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj died in his hometown of Nishapur in 875 CE. His legacy has endured for over a millennium:

- Sahih Muslim is studied in religious institutions worldwide.
- Numerous commentaries have been written on his collection, the most famous being al-Nawawi's explanation.
- His methodology influenced the development of hadith criticism as a scientific discipline.
- His work remains a primary source for Islamic law and practice.
- Along with al-Bukhari, he is often referred to as "the two sheikhs" (al-ShaykhƒÅn), signifying their paramount status in hadith scholarship.
