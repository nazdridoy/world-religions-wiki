Sayyid Qutb Ibrahim Husayn Shadhili (1906-1966) was an Egyptian author, Islamic theorist, and leading intellectual of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood whose writings have profoundly influenced Islamic revivalist movements worldwide. His radical critique of modernity, secularism, and Western civilization, coupled with his vision of an Islamic state governed by Sharia, has made him one of the most influential—and controversial—Islamic thinkers of the 20th century.

## Early Life and Education

Born in the Egyptian village of Musha in Asyut Province, Qutb received a traditional religious education before pursuing modern education at Dar al-Ulum in Cairo, where he graduated in 1933. Initially, he worked as an educator and literary critic, writing poetry and novels while working for the Egyptian Ministry of Education.

In 1948, the ministry sent him to study the educational system in the United States. His two-year stay in America proved to be a transformative experience that cemented his negative view of Western civilization, which he considered spiritually empty and morally decadent.

## Ideological Development

Qutb's ideological journey took him from secular literary criticism to radical Islamist thought:

### Literary Period
In his early career, Qutb was primarily known as a literary critic, poet, and novelist. His works from this period reflected nationalist themes and social concerns.

### Islamic Turn
Upon returning from America in 1950, Qutb had undergone a profound ideological transformation. He formally joined the Muslim Brotherhood in 1953 and soon became the chief editor of the organization's newspaper and a member of its Guidance Council.

### Prison Radicalization
Following the Brotherhood's banning in 1954, Qutb was arrested along with thousands of Brotherhood members. His experience of torture and imprisonment under Nasser's regime intensified his radicalism. Most of his influential Islamist writings were composed during his lengthy imprisonment.

## Key Concepts

Qutb's thought introduced several concepts that have become fundamental to modern Islamist movements:

### Jahiliyyah
Qutb reinterpreted the traditional concept of jahiliyyah (ignorance of divine guidance), which historically referred to pre-Islamic Arabia. He applied it to contemporary Muslim societies that had adopted secular laws and values, arguing that they had reverted to a state of jahiliyyah despite their nominal Muslim identity.

### Hakimiyyah
He emphasized the concept of hakimiyyah (sovereignty), insisting that sovereignty belongs exclusively to God. Any system where humans legislate is, according to Qutb, a form of shirk (idolatry) because it usurps God's legislative authority.

### Islamic Vanguard
Qutb called for a dedicated vanguard of true Muslims to separate themselves spiritually and intellectually from jahili society, then work to establish an authentically Islamic social order.

## Major Works

### "Fi Zilal al-Qur'an" (In the Shade of the Qur'an)
A monumental Quranic commentary written largely in prison, this work interprets the Quran through the lens of contemporary social and political concerns. Rather than focusing exclusively on linguistic analysis or legal derivation, Qutb emphasized the Quran's relevance to modern struggles.

### "Ma'alim fi al-Tariq" (Milestones)
His most influential work, "Milestones" distills Qutb's radical vision and serves as a manifesto for Islamic revival. The Egyptian government considered it so dangerous that merely possessing the book was grounds for arrest during certain periods.

### "Al-'Adalah al-Ijtima'iyah fi al-Islam" (Social Justice in Islam)
Written earlier in his Islamist period, this work presents Islam as a comprehensive system that ensures social justice, in contrast to both capitalism and communism.

## Execution and Legacy

In 1966, Qutb was tried for conspiracy to assassinate President Nasser and overthrow the government. Despite international appeals for clemency, he was executed by hanging on August 29, 1966. His martyrdom cemented his status among his followers.

His legacy is complex and contested:

- His writings have inspired generations of Islamist activists, from moderate reformers to violent extremists
- Many jihadist movements have drawn on his concepts, including al-Qaeda
- His vision of Islam as a comprehensive political system challenges both secular nationalism and traditional quietist interpretations of religion
- Critics argue his binary division of the world into Islamic and jahili has contributed to extremism
- His literary works have been largely overshadowed by his political writings

## Influence on Modern Islamic Movements

Qutb's ideas have influenced:

- The Muslim Brotherhood's evolution, particularly its more radical elements
- The development of jihadist ideology that emerged in the late 20th century
- Islamic political movements across the Muslim world
- Contemporary debates about Islam's relationship to modernity, democracy, and the West
