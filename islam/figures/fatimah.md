# Fatimah al-Zahra

![Fatimah al-Zahra](../../images/fatimah.jpg)

Fatimah al-Zahra (605-632 CE) was the youngest daughter of the Prophet Muhammad and his first wife Khadijah. As the only child of Muhammad to have surviving descendants, she holds a unique place in Islamic history and is revered by all Muslims, but especially by Shia Muslims who trace their lineage of Imams through her marriage to Ali ibn Abi Talib. Known for her piety, eloquence, and moral virtues, Fatimah is considered one of the most important female figures in Islamic tradition.

## Early Life and Family

Born in Mecca five years before Muhammad's prophethood began, Fatimah grew up in a household that would become the epicenter of a new faith. She was the youngest of Muhammad and Khadijah's daughters, with her siblings including Zainab, Ruqayyah, and Umm Kulthum.

Fatimah's early life coincided with the challenging early years of Islam, and she witnessed:
- The persecution of Muslims in Mecca
- The death of her mother Khadijah when Fatimah was around 15 years old
- The migration (Hijra) to Medina
- The establishment of the first Muslim community

These formative experiences shaped her character and strengthened her commitment to Islam.

## Marriage to Ali

Around 624 CE, two years after the Hijra, Fatimah married Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's cousin and close companion. The marriage is significant in Islamic history for several reasons:

- It united two of the central figures of early Islam
- It established the lineage through which Muhammad's descendants would continue
- It exemplified a union based on piety rather than wealth or status
- It is celebrated in numerous traditions as a model of Islamic marriage

According to both Sunni and Shia traditions, when Ali approached Muhammad to ask for Fatimah's hand, several wealthier suitors had already been refused. Muhammad is said to have told Ali that he had been ordered by God to give Fatimah to him in marriage.

## Children and Family Life

Fatimah and Ali had five children:
- Hasan: The second Imam in Shia tradition
- Husayn: The third Imam and martyr of Karbala
- Zaynab: A significant figure known for her bravery at Karbala
- Umm Kulthum: Named after Fatimah's sister
- Muhsin: According to Shia sources, he died before birth due to injuries Fatimah sustained

Fatimah's household was known for its simplicity and devotion to spiritual values despite the hardships they faced. There are numerous accounts of their ascetic lifestyle, with Fatimah performing all household chores herself despite her status as the Prophet's daughter.

## Character and Virtues

Fatimah is known by several honorific titles that reflect her character:
- **Al-Zahra** (The Radiant One): For her luminous spiritual presence
- **Al-Batul** (The Pure/Virgin): For her purity and devotion
- **Umm Abiha** (Mother of her Father): For her care of Muhammad after Khadijah's death
- **Sayyidat Nisa al-Alamin** (Leader of the Women of the Worlds): A title given to her by Muhammad

Her character is described in Islamic tradition as exemplifying:
- Profound piety and devotion in worship
- Patience in the face of hardship
- Generosity despite personal need
- Knowledge of religious matters
- Eloquence in speech and argument
- Modesty and propriety in conduct

## Role During Muhammad's Lifetime

During Muhammad's lifetime, Fatimah played several important roles:
- She cared for her father after her mother's death
- She participated in nursing the wounded during battles
- She supported the early Muslim community through difficult times
- She was known to be unusually close to her father, who showed her great affection
- She was present at many important events in early Islamic history

Muhammad is reported to have said about her, "Fatimah is a part of me, and whoever displeases her displeases me." This statement has been cited extensively in Islamic literature to indicate her special status.

## Final Days and Death

After Muhammad's death in 632 CE, Fatimah faced a period of difficulty and sorrow. The most significant controversy surrounds the issue of inheritance and the leadership succession:

- According to Sunni accounts, she had a disagreement with Abu Bakr over the inheritance of her father's property but eventually accepted the situation
- According to Shia narratives, she strongly protested Abu Bakr's caliphate, believing Ali had been designated as Muhammad's successor, and never reconciled with him

Fatimah died six months after her father, at the age of approximately 27-29. The grief of losing her father is often cited as contributing to her early death. Her burial was conducted privately at night, according to her wishes.

## Significance in Islamic Tradition

### In Sunni Islam
- Revered as one of the four "perfect women" in history (along with Mary, Asiya, and Khadijah)
- Respected as the beloved daughter of Muhammad and source of his descendants
- Exemplar of womanly virtues, piety, and family devotion
- A model for Muslim women in modesty and faith

### In Shia Islam
- Holds an even more elevated position, considered almost infallible
- Seen as central to the concept of Ahl al-Bayt (People of the House)
- Remembered especially during mourning rituals of Muharram alongside Husayn
- Believed to have special intercessory powers
- The lineage of Imams passes through her and Ali

Her final sermon following her father's death is particularly revered in Shia tradition as a powerful statement on justice, divine authority, and the rights of the Ahl al-Bayt.

## Legacy and Influence

Fatimah's descendants through Hasan and Husayn, known as Sayyids or Sharifs, have played significant roles throughout Islamic history as religious leaders, scholars, and rulers. The Fatimid Caliphate, which ruled North Africa, Egypt, and parts of the Levant from 909-1171 CE, was named after her.

In contemporary Muslim world, Fatimah remains:
- A symbol of female piety, strength, and dignity
- Namesake for countless Muslim women across the world
- Subject of poetry, literature, and devotional works
- A central figure in religious commemorations, especially in Shia communities
- An inspiration for various charitable and educational institutions
