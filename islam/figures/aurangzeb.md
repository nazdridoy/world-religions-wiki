![Aurangzeb](../../images/aurangzeb.jpg)

Aurangzeb Alamgir (1618-1707), born Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad, was the sixth emperor of the Mughal Empire, ruling over the Indian subcontinent for 49 years from 1658 until his death in 1707. His reign marked both the territorial zenith of the Mughal Empire and the beginning of its decline. A controversial figure in South Asian history, Aurangzeb is remembered for his military conquests, administrative reforms, religious policies, and austere personal lifestyle. His legacy remains deeply contested, with sharply divergent interpretations among historians, religious communities, and political perspectives.

## Early Life and Rise to Power

Born in 1618 to Emperor Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal (for whom the Taj Mahal was built), Aurangzeb was raised as a prince with extensive education in statecraft, military strategy, Islamic theology, and the arts. As a young man, he served as governor of the Deccan provinces, where he gained valuable administrative and military experience.

Aurangzeb's path to the throne involved a brutal war of succession against his brothers following Shah Jahan's illness in 1657:
- Defeated his eldest brother Dara Shikoh, who was their father's favored successor
- Executed his brothers Dara Shikoh and Murad Baksh
- Imprisoned his father Shah Jahan in Agra Fort until the former emperor's death in 1666
- Crowned himself emperor in 1658 with the title Alamgir ("Conqueror of the World")

## Military Campaigns and Territorial Expansion

Under Aurangzeb, the Mughal Empire reached its greatest territorial extent:

- Reconquered Assam in the northeast
- Expanded into the Deccan plateau by conquering the Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda
- Captured the Maratha fortress of Bijapur after a lengthy campaign against Shivaji and his son Sambhaji
- Extended Mughal control into parts of present-day Afghanistan
- Conducted campaigns in Rajputana against formerly allied Rajput kingdoms

By the end of his reign, the empire stretched from Afghanistan in the northwest to Bengal in the east, and from Kashmir in the north to the Deccan in the south. However, these expansions came at a tremendous cost in resources and manpower, straining the empire's finances and military capabilities.

## Administration and Governance

Aurangzeb was known for his rigorous approach to governance:

- Expanded the mansabdari system of military and administrative ranks
- Established a more comprehensive tax collection system
- Appointed officials based primarily on merit and loyalty rather than heredity
- Enacted measures against corruption and bribery among officials
- Personally reviewed petitions and supervised administration
- Simplified the legal system and codified laws
- Built roads, bridges, and sarais (rest houses) to facilitate trade and communication
- Strengthened frontier defenses through strategic fortress construction

## Religious Policies

Aurangzeb's religious policies represent his most controversial aspects:

- Reimposed the jizya tax on non-Muslims, which had been abolished by Akbar
- Restricted the building of new Hindu temples and the repair of existing ones
- Ordered the destruction of some Hindu temples, particularly those associated with political opposition
- Appointed censors (muhtasibs) to enforce Islamic moral codes
- Banned practices he considered un-Islamic, including music at court, alcohol, and certain celebrations
- Supported the compilation of the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, a comprehensive code of Islamic law
- Promoted Islamic education through madrasas and supported Islamic scholars
- Encouraged conversion to Islam through various incentives

These policies represented a significant departure from the religious tolerance practiced by his predecessors, particularly Akbar. However, historians debate whether these actions were primarily motivated by religious orthodoxy or political pragmatism.

## Personal Character and Lifestyle

Unlike many Mughal emperors known for their opulence, Aurangzeb lived an austere life:

- Followed a strict interpretation of Islamic law in his personal life
- Wore simple clothes and avoided luxuries
- Supported himself by making prayer caps and copying the Quran
- Refused to use state treasury funds for personal expenses
- Maintained a disciplined daily routine focused on governance and religious observance
- Was known for his piety, reportedly performing all five daily prayers and fasting regularly
- Abstained from alcohol and other intoxicants
- Limited artistic patronage compared to his predecessors

## Challenges and Resistance

Despite his military power, Aurangzeb faced significant resistance throughout his reign:

- The Maratha Confederacy under Shivaji and later leaders waged persistent guerrilla warfare
- Sikh resistance in Punjab intensified, especially following the execution of Guru Tegh Bahadur
- Rajput kingdoms that had previously been Mughal allies rebelled
- Jat uprisings occurred in the regions around Agra and Delhi
- The Ahom kingdom in Assam successfully resisted Mughal annexation
- Persistent rebellions in the Deccan drained imperial resources
- Religious tensions increased among various communities

These concurrent challenges stretched imperial resources and administration, laying the groundwork for the empire's later fragmentation.

## Legacy and Historical Interpretation

Aurangzeb's legacy remains deeply contested:

### Traditional Muslim Perspective
- Viewed as a just ruler who governed according to Islamic principles
- Celebrated for his personal piety and simple lifestyle
- Admired for his attempts to create a more Islamic state
- Seen as a defender of Islam in a predominantly non-Muslim land

### Traditional Hindu and Sikh Perspective
- Criticized for religious intolerance and destruction of temples
- Viewed as imposing discriminatory policies against non-Muslims
- Remembered for the execution of Guru Tegh Bahadur and other religious leaders
- Seen as reversing the tolerant policies established by Akbar

### Modern Historical Reassessment
- Recognition that his policies were often more complex and pragmatic than purely ideological
- Acknowledgment that many temple destructions were politically motivated rather than solely religious
- Understanding that he maintained Hindu officials in high positions and granted land to Hindu institutions
- Appreciation for his administrative competence and personal integrity
- Recognition that economic and demographic factors, rather than religious policy alone, contributed to imperial decline

## Decline and Death

The last years of Aurangzeb's reign witnessed the beginning of imperial decline:

- Continuous warfare in the Deccan drained the treasury
- The administrative system became increasingly strained
- Regional powers began asserting greater autonomy
- The emperor himself grew increasingly isolated
- At the age of 88, Aurangzeb died in 1707 in the Deccan
- In his final letters, he expressed concern about the future of the empire

Within decades of his death, the Mughal Empire would lose significant territories and central authority, eventually becoming a nominal power controlled by regional forces and, later, European colonial powers.
