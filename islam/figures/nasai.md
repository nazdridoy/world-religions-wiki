# Al-Nasa'i

![Al-Nasa'i](../../images/al_nasai.jpg)

Abu Abd al-Rahman Ahmad ibn Shu'ayb ibn Ali ibn Sinan al-Nasa'i (829-915 CE), commonly known as Imam al-Nasa'i, was one of the most prominent hadith scholars of the early Islamic era. He is renowned for his compilation "Sunan al-Nasa'i," one of the six canonical hadith collections in Sunni Islam, and is widely respected for having some of the most stringent criteria for hadith acceptance.

## Life and Background

Born in Nasa, Khorasan (in modern-day Turkmenistan), al-Nasa'i began his pursuit of Islamic knowledge from an early age. He embarked on extensive scholarly journeys throughout the Islamic world, including Iraq, Hejaz, Syria, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula, studying under numerous respected authorities of his time.

Al-Nasa'i eventually settled in Egypt, where he taught hadith sciences and developed his methodical approach to hadith criticism. Later in life, he moved to Damascus, where he faced challenges due to his support for Ali ibn Abi Talib and his refusal to recognize some of the political authorities of his time.

## Sunan al-Nasa'i

His major contribution to Islamic scholarship is "Al-Sunan al-Kubra" (The Major Sunan), which he later refined into a more concise work known as "Al-Sunan al-Sughra" (The Minor Sunan) or "Al-Mujtaba." This latter work is the one that became part of the six canonical hadith collections. The collection features:

- **Highly Selective Criteria**: Al-Nasa'i applied the most stringent conditions among the six major collectors for accepting narrators.
- **Legal Focus**: His collection particularly emphasizes hadiths related to legal rulings.
- **Subtle Defect Identification**: He excelled at identifying hidden defects ('ilal) in hadith narrations.
- **Methodical Organization**: Hadiths are arranged according to fiqh (jurisprudence) topics.
- **Critical Commentary**: He often includes remarks on the reliability of narrators and chains of transmission.

The work contains approximately 5,761 hadiths, carefully selected from the vast number he examined throughout his career.

## Methodology and Expertise

Al-Nasa'i was distinguished by his rigorous approach to hadith evaluation:

- **Narrator Criticism**: He developed precise criteria for evaluating the reliability of narrators.
- **Chain Analysis**: He paid particular attention to subtle disconnections in chains of transmission.
- **Comparative Study**: He often compared different versions of the same hadith to identify discrepancies.
- **Textual Criticism**: He examined the text (matn) of hadiths for consistency with established Islamic principles.
- **Historical Context**: He considered the historical context of hadiths in his evaluations.

He was particularly known for his expertise in identifying defects in narrations that appeared sound on the surface, demonstrating his profound knowledge of narrators and transmission history.

## Other Works

Besides his famous Sunan, al-Nasa'i authored several other significant works:

- **Kitab al-Du'afa wa'l-Matrukin**: A compilation of weak and rejected narrators
- **Khasa'is Ali**: A collection of hadiths concerning the virtues of Ali ibn Abi Talib
- **Fadha'il al-Sahabah**: On the virtues of the companions of the Prophet
- **Al-Sunan al-Kubra**: His original, more extensive collection
- **Al-Tafsir**: A work on Quranic exegesis

His work on Ali's virtues reflects his Sunni perspective that nevertheless recognized Ali's special status, a position that sometimes created political difficulties for him.

## Death and Legacy

Al-Nasa'i's death came under tragic circumstances. After moving to Damascus, he was reportedly asked about the virtues of Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan. His response, which was perceived as favoring Ali, angered some locals who physically attacked him. He passed away in 915 CE in Palestine while on his way to Mecca, possibly as a result of these injuries.

His scholarly legacy endures through:

- His position as one of the six canonical hadith collectors in Sunni tradition
- His methodological contributions to the science of hadith criticism
- His influence on subsequent generations of hadith scholars
- His reputation for integrity and unwavering adherence to scholarly principles even when politically inconvenient
