# Saladin (Salah ad-Din)

![Saladin](../../images/saladin.jpg)

Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (1137-1193 CE), commonly known as Saladin in the Western world, was a Kurdish Muslim ruler who founded the Ayyubid dynasty. He is renowned for recapturing Jerusalem from the Crusaders, his military prowess, chivalrous conduct, and magnanimity toward his enemies. As Sultan of Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Palestine, Saladin united Muslim territories and successfully led the Muslim military campaign against the Crusader states in the Levant.

## Early Life and Rise to Power

Saladin was born in 1137 CE in Tikrit (in modern-day Iraq) to a Kurdish family of Armenian descent. His family served the Zengid dynasty, and his father Ayyub (Job) and uncle Shirkuh were military commanders under Nur ad-Din, the ruler of Syria.

Key stages in his rise to prominence include:

- **Early Military Career**: Served under his uncle Shirkuh in Egypt, where they were sent by Nur ad-Din to counter Crusader influence
- **Governor of Egypt**: Appointed vizier of Fatimid Egypt in 1169 after his uncle's death
- **End of the Fatimid Caliphate**: Abolished the Shia Fatimid Caliphate in 1171, bringing Egypt back under nominal Abbasid authority
- **Independence**: Gradually built his power base in Egypt while maintaining nominal allegiance to Nur ad-Din
- **Expansion**: After Nur ad-Din's death in 1174, gradually took control of Damascus and unified Syria and Egypt under his rule
- **Foundation of Dynasty**: Established the Ayyubid dynasty that would rule Egypt and parts of the Middle East for decades

## The Counter-Crusade

Saladin's most celebrated achievements came in his campaigns against the Crusader states. These efforts culminated in the recapture of Jerusalem, which had been under Christian rule for 88 years.

### Military Campaigns

- **Early Confrontations**: Initial skirmishes and battles with Crusader forces, including a defeat at Mont Gisard (1177)
- **Battle of Hattin (1187)**: Decisive victory where he captured King Guy of Jerusalem and effectively destroyed the Crusader army
- **Conquest of Jerusalem (October 1187)**: Recaptured the holy city, considered his greatest achievement
- **Further Conquests**: Captured numerous Crusader strongholds including Acre, Jaffa, and Ascalon
- **Third Crusade**: Successfully defended most of his gains against the forces of Richard I (the Lionheart) of England, Philip II of France, and Frederick Barbarossa

### The Jerusalem Conquest

Saladin's treatment of Jerusalem's inhabitants after his conquest stands in stark contrast to the Crusaders' bloody capture of the city in 1099. He:

- Allowed safe passage for Christian civilians rather than massacring them
- Protected Eastern Christians and allowed them to remain
- Permitted Christian pilgrims to visit the holy sites
- Preserved the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other Christian sanctuaries
- Restored Islamic and Jewish sacred places that had been converted or restricted

## Character and Leadership

Historical accounts from both Muslim and Christian sources portray Saladin as possessing exceptional qualities:

- **Piety**: Devoted to Islamic principles and practices
- **Simplicity**: Maintained modest personal habits despite his status
- **Generosity**: Known for distributing wealth to the poor, leaving little in his treasury upon his death
- **Justice**: Applied law fairly across religious lines
- **Chivalry**: Respected by enemies for his honorable conduct in war and peace
- **Diplomatic Skill**: Balanced complex relationships with Muslim and Christian leaders
- **Military Leadership**: Inspired loyalty through personal courage and strategic acumen

His relationship with Richard I of England exemplifies his character. Despite being fierce enemies on the battlefield, they developed mutual respect. When Richard fell ill, Saladin reportedly sent him peaches, pears, and snow from Mount Hermon to cool his fever.

## Administrative and Cultural Contributions

Beyond military conquests, Saladin made lasting contributions to the regions he ruled:

- **Educational Institutions**: Established madrasas (religious schools) throughout his territories
- **Infrastructure**: Built hospitals, fortifications, and public works
- **Religious Tolerance**: Maintained a policy of religious coexistence that allowed Christians and Jews substantial freedoms
- **Revival of Sunni Islam**: Promoted orthodox Sunni teachings after decades of Fatimid Shia rule in Egypt
- **Architectural Patronage**: Sponsored numerous buildings, including the Citadel of Cairo
- **Judicial Reform**: Appointed qualified judges and sought to standardize legal practices

## Legacy and Historical Significance

Saladin died in Damascus in 1193, shortly after concluding a peace treaty with the Crusaders. His legacy has endured through centuries in both the Islamic world and the West:

### In Islamic History

### In Western Perception

- Gradually transformed in European literature from feared enemy to noble adversary
- Featured positively in works from Dante's "Divine Comedy" to Walter Scott's "The Talisman"
- Often cited as an exemplar of chivalrous conduct, even by his former enemies
