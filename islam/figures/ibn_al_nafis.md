# Ibn al-Nafis

![Ibn al-Nafis](../../images/ibn_al_nafis.jpg)

Ibn al-Nafis (1213-1288 CE), born Ala al-Din Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Abi al-Hazm al-Qarshi al-Dimashqi, was a pioneering Arab physician, anatomist, physiologist, surgeon, ophthalmologist, and Islamic jurist from Damascus, Syria. He is best known for being the first to describe the pulmonary circulation of the blood, a discovery that predated William Harvey's complete description of the circulatory system by more than three centuries. His work represents one of the most important discoveries in the history of medicine and physiology.

## Life and Career

Born in Damascus, Ibn al-Nafis received his education in medicine at the Bimaristan al-Noori, a major hospital and medical college in Damascus. After completing his education, he moved to Cairo, Egypt, where he had a distinguished career as the chief physician at the Al-Mansouri Hospital. He also served as the personal physician to Sultan Baibars.

Beyond his medical work, Ibn al-Nafis was a respected Islamic jurist of the Shafi'i school and wrote on Islamic jurisprudence. He was known for his piety and is said to have never missed the dawn prayer throughout his adult life. Upon his death, he donated his house, library, and clinic to the Mansuriyyah Hospital.

## Medical Discoveries and Contributions

### Pulmonary Circulation

Ibn al-Nafis's most significant contribution to medical science was his correct description of pulmonary circulation:

- He challenged Galen's 400-year-old theory that blood could pass directly from the right to the left ventricle of the heart through invisible pores in the cardiac septum
- Accurately described that blood from the right ventricle must pass through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where it "mixes with air" (is oxygenated)
- Explained that blood then passes through the pulmonary vein to the left ventricle of the heart
- Identified the pulmonary circulation as the mechanism by which the blood is refreshed with both air and the vital spirit before being distributed throughout the body

This discovery was documented in his commentary on Ibn Sina's (Avicenna's) "Canon of Medicine," titled "Sharh Tashrih al-Qanun Ibn Sina" (Commentary on the Anatomy of Ibn Sina's Canon). The significance of this discovery cannot be overstated, as it corrected a fundamental error in Galenic medicine that had persisted for over a millennium.

### Coronary Circulation

Ibn al-Nafis also made important observations about coronary circulation:

- Recognized that the heart is nourished by vessels that run through its substance (coronary arteries and veins)
- Understood that cardiac nutrition happens through vessels that pass into the heart, not through blood in the cardiac chambers as Galen had claimed
- Described aspects of the coronary circulation's anatomy correctly

### Anatomy and Physiology

Beyond circulatory discoveries, Ibn al-Nafis made other important anatomical and physiological contributions:

- Provided accurate descriptions of the bronchi and interaction between the bronchi and arteries
- Improved understanding of the anatomy of the eye and vision mechanisms
- Described aspects of the cerebral anatomy and cranial nerves
- Developed a more sophisticated understanding of how the heart functions as a muscle
- Emphasized observation and dissection over reliance on ancient authorities

### Medical Methodology

Ibn al-Nafis demonstrated a remarkably modern approach to medical science:

- Emphasized empirical evidence over established authority
- Advocated for careful observation and logical deduction
- Criticized blind adherence to ancient Greek medical texts
- Applied principles of Islamic jurisprudence to develop a methodical approach to medical inquiry
- Insisted on verification of theories through careful examination

## Major Works

Ibn al-Nafis was a prolific author who wrote on various aspects of medicine, philosophy, and Islamic jurisprudence:

- **Sharh Tashrih al-Qanun Ibn Sina** (Commentary on the Anatomy of Ibn Sina's Canon) - His most important work containing the description of pulmonary circulation
- **Al-Shamil fi al-Tibb** (The Comprehensive Book on Medicine) - An encyclopedic work intended to contain 300 volumes, though only 80 were completed
- **Mujaz al-Qanun** (The Summary of the Canon) - A synopsis of Ibn Sina's Canon of Medicine
- **Kitab al-Mukhtar min al-Aghdhiya** (The Selected from Food Items) - A work on nutrition and dietetics
- **Al-Risalah al-Kamiliyyah fi al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah** (The Treatise of Kamil on the Prophet's Biography) - A theological-philosophical fictional novel
- **Sharh Epidemiya li-Buqrat** (Commentary on Hippocrates' Epidemics)
- **Kitab al-Mujiz** (The Concise Book) - A medical manual that remained popular for centuries

## Legacy and Influence

The significance of Ibn al-Nafis's discovery of pulmonary circulation was not fully appreciated in the Western medical tradition until much later:

- His work was translated into Latin in 1547 by Andrea Alpago
- It may have influenced later European anatomists, including Michael Servetus, Realdo Colombo, and William Harvey
- The full recognition of his contributions came only in the 20th century, when his manuscripts were rediscovered in 1924 in the Prussian State Library in Berlin by the Egyptian physician Muhyo Al-Deen Altawi

Today, Ibn al-Nafis is recognized as one of the greatest physicians of the medieval period and a crucial figure in the development of cardiology and circulatory physiology. His work exemplifies the important contributions of Islamic medicine to global medical knowledge.

## Philosophical and Theological Thought

Beyond his medical work, Ibn al-Nafis engaged with philosophical and theological questions:

- Developed a materialism-leaning philosophical system that emphasized the physical basis of mental processes
- Wrote on the relationship between faith and reason from an Islamic perspective
- Composed a philosophical novel, "Al-Risalah al-Kamiliyyah," sometimes described as a response to Ibn Tufail's "Hayy ibn Yaqzan"
- Applied logical reasoning derived from Islamic jurisprudence to scientific inquiry
- Contributed to discussions on determinism, free will, and causality
