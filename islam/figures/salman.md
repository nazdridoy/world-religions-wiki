Salman al-Farisi (Persian: سلمان فارسی‎), also known as Salman the Persian or Salman the Pure (d. 656/657 CE), was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad and one of the most revered figures in Islamic history. His remarkable journey from Zoroastrianism through Christianity to Islam, his wisdom, and his role in key events of early Islamic history have made him a symbol of the universal nature of the Islamic message and the spiritual search for truth.

## Early Life and Spiritual Journey

Born in the Persian town of Kazerun into a Zoroastrian family, Salman (originally named Rozbeh) was raised as a devout practitioner of the ancient Iranian religion. As the son of a dehqan (landowner or village headman), he was privileged and well-educated:

- His father was the caretaker of a sacred fire temple, and Salman was being groomed for this responsibility
- As a young man, he encountered Christians and was drawn to their monotheistic beliefs
- Abandoning his family's religion, he traveled to Syria to study Christianity
- He served several Christian scholars, moving from one master to another as they died

According to traditional accounts, the last Christian master informed Salman about the coming of a prophet in Arabia with specific signs. This set Salman on a journey that would be interrupted when he was sold into slavery and passed between Jewish masters before ultimately reaching Medina.

## Meeting the Prophet

When Salman finally reached Medina, Muhammad had already migrated there from Mecca:

- Upon meeting Muhammad, Salman recognized the prophesied signs, including the "seal of prophethood" between his shoulders
- Salman accepted Islam, but remained enslaved until Muhammad helped arrange for his freedom
- The Muslims and Salman made an agreement with his master for his manumission in exchange for planting 300 date palms and a substantial sum
- Muhammad personally helped plant some of the trees, and they miraculously grew in an accelerated fashion

This story of Salman's conversion and freedom appears in various hadith collections and biographies of the Prophet.

## Contributions to Early Islam

Salman made several significant contributions to the early Muslim community:

### The Battle of the Trench (Khandaq)
- Suggested digging a defensive trench around Medina in 627 CE to protect the city from the attacking Meccan forces
- This Persian military tactic was unknown to the Arabs and proved decisive in the battle
- The Prophet acknowledged his valuable strategic advice, saying "Salman is one of us, the people of the Household (Ahl al-Bayt)"

### Bridging Cultures
- Served as a translator and cultural interpreter between the Arabs and Persians
- Helped facilitate the spread of Islam into Persian territories
- Demonstrated that Islam transcended ethnic and cultural boundaries

### Knowledge and Wisdom
- Known for his profound wisdom and spiritual insights
- Transmitted numerous hadith that are recorded in major collections

## Later Life and Legacy

After Muhammad's death, Salman continued to serve the Muslim community:

- He participated in the conquest of Persia during the caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab
- Served as the governor of Ctesiphon (al-Mada'in) in Iraq
- Lived an ascetic lifestyle despite his position, reportedly making basket-weaving his livelihood
- Said to have lived over 250 years according to some traditions, though most historians consider this symbolic of his spiritual wisdom

Salman died around 656-657 CE during the caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan. He was buried in al-Mada'in (modern-day Salman Pak, Iraq), where his tomb became an important pilgrimage site.
