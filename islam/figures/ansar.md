# The Ansar

![The Ansar](../../images/ansar.jpg)

The Ansar ("Helpers" or "Supporters" in Arabic) were the local inhabitants of Medina (formerly known as Yathrib) who converted to Islam and supported the Prophet Muhammad and the Muhajirun (emigrants from Mecca) following the Hijra (migration) in 622 CE. Primarily consisting of members from the Arab tribes of Aws and Khazraj, the Ansar played a crucial role in the establishment and early success of the Islamic community, providing political support, military strength, and material resources during the formative period of Islam.

## Historical Background

Before the arrival of Islam, Medina was inhabited primarily by two major Arab tribes—Aws and Khazraj—along with several Jewish tribes including Banu Qaynuqa, Banu Nadir, and Banu Qurayza. The Arab tribes had been locked in bitter, long-standing feuds, with the most recent major conflict being the Battle of Bu'ath around 617 CE.

The social and political conditions in Medina created an environment receptive to Muhammad's message:

- The Arab tribes were exhausted from years of internal conflict
- The presence of Jewish communities had familiarized the population with monotheistic concepts
- The absence of a unifying leadership created an opportunity for a neutral arbitrator
- Economic challenges made social reforms appealing

## First Contact with Islam

The first significant contact between the people of Medina and Islam occurred during the pilgrimage seasons when Muhammad preached to visitors from various tribes. Key developments included:

- Around 620 CE, a small group from the Khazraj tribe met Muhammad in Mecca and expressed interest in his message
- In 621 CE, twelve men from Medina took an oath of allegiance to Muhammad at Al-Aqaba (First Pledge of Aqaba)
- In 622 CE, a larger delegation of seventy-three men and two women from Medina pledged to protect Muhammad as they would their own families (Second Pledge of Aqaba)

The Second Pledge of Aqaba provided Muhammad with the invitation and security guarantees needed to migrate to Medina, a pivotal moment in Islamic history.

## Role in Early Islamic Society

After the Hijra, the Ansar demonstrated extraordinary generosity and commitment to the new faith:

### Material Support

- They offered housing to the Muhajirun who had left their properties in Mecca
- Many shared their wealth, lands, and even offered to divide their inheritances
- They provided economic support until the Muhajirun could establish themselves

### Political Support

- They accepted Muhammad as both religious and political leader
- They embraced the Constitution of Medina, the first written constitution of the Muslim community
- They helped establish Medina as the first Islamic political entity
- They respected the principle of consultation (shura) established by Muhammad

### Military Contributions

- They formed the majority of fighters in early battles including Badr and Uhud
- They defended Medina during the Battle of the Trench (Khandaq)
- They participated in the conquest of Mecca and subsequent expansion
- Their tribal warrior traditions strengthened the Muslim forces

## Prominent Ansar Figures

Several individuals from the Ansar became significant figures in early Islamic history:

- **Sa'd ibn Mu'adh**: Chief of the Aws tribe who embraced Islam and became a close companion of Muhammad
- **Sa'd ibn Ubadah**: Leader of the Khazraj tribe who was considered for the caliphate after Muhammad's death
- **Ubayy ibn Ka'b**: One of the greatest scholars of the Quran among the companions
- **Abu Ayyub al-Ansari**: Who hosted Muhammad when he first arrived in Medina
- **Hassan ibn Thabit**: Known as the "Poet of the Prophet" who defended Islam through poetry
- **Umm Umara (Nusaybah bint Ka'ab)**: A female warrior who fought in several battles

These individuals exemplified the commitment of the Ansar to the new faith and its prophet.

## The Brotherhood Bond

One of Muhammad's first actions in Medina was to establish a system of brotherhood (mu'akhat) between individual Muhajirun and Ansar. This innovative social bond:

- Created formal relationships between specific emigrants and helpers
- Established legal rights similar to blood relations, including inheritance (in the early period)
- Facilitated economic integration of the Meccan refugees
- Demonstrated the Islamic principle that faith supersedes tribal and blood ties
- Created a new social fabric based on religious identity rather than tribal affiliation

This brotherhood system is considered one of the most successful examples of social integration in history and reflects the depth of the Ansar's commitment to Islam.

## Post-Prophetic Period

After Muhammad's death in 632 CE, the role and influence of the Ansar underwent significant changes:

- During the succession crisis, they initially proposed a shared leadership with the slogan "a leader from us and a leader from you"
- They ultimately accepted Abu Bakr as caliph after his famous speech recognizing the special status of both Muhajirun and Ansar
- Their political influence gradually diminished during the subsequent caliphates
- They remained respected for their historical role and early service to Islam
- Many became transmitters of hadith and religious knowledge
- Their descendants continued to be identified and honored as "children of the Ansar"

## Legacy and Historical Significance

The Ansar's legacy in Islamic history is profound:

- They exemplify the Islamic values of selflessness, brotherhood, and sacrifice
- The concept of "Ansar" became a model for future Islamic movements seeking to establish Muslim communities
- Their acceptance of refugees established a precedent for Islamic hospitality and care for the displaced
- Their willingness to transcend tribal identity for religious brotherhood became a foundational Islamic principle
- Their integration with the Muhajirun demonstrated the universality of the Islamic message across tribal and regional divisions
- Their historical memory is preserved in numerous Quranic verses, hadith, and historical accounts that praise their virtue

The Quran specifically honors them: "And the foremost to embrace Islam of the Muhajirun and the Ansar and also those who followed them exactly in faith. Allah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him" (9:100).
