# Female Sufis

![Female Sufis](../../images/female_sufis.jpg)

Women have played a profound and often overlooked role in the development and practice of Sufism, the mystical dimension of Islam. Throughout history, female Sufi masters (murshidat) and practitioners have contributed significantly to Sufi thought, literature, and practice, often transcending the gender limitations of their societies through their spiritual authority. From the earliest days of Islam to contemporary times, these women have demonstrated that the path of divine love and mystical knowledge recognizes no gender distinctions, as they attained the highest spiritual stations and guided both men and women on the Sufi path.

## Early Female Mystics

The tradition of female Islamic mysticism began in the formative period of Sufism:

### Rabi'a al-Adawiyya (c. 717-801 CE)

- Preeminent early Sufi saint from Basra, Iraq

- Lived as an ascetic, rejecting marriage to focus on devotion to God
- Famous for her poetry expressing pure love for God beyond fear or reward
- Regarded as a spiritual authority by male contemporaries including Hassan al-Basri
- Developed the concept of disinterested love of God for God's sake alone
- Her famous prayer: "O God, if I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell; if I worship You in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise; but if I worship You for Your own sake, do not withhold from me Your Eternal Beauty"
