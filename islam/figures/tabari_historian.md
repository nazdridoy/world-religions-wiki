# Al-Tabari (as Historian)

![Al-Tabari](../../images/tabari.jpg)

Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (839-923 CE) stands as one of the most influential and comprehensive historians of early Islam. His monumental work, "Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk" (History of the Prophets and Kings), also known as "Tarikh al-Tabari," revolutionized Islamic historiography and remains an indispensable primary source for understanding the first three centuries of Islamic history. Beyond his historical writings, al-Tabari was also a distinguished Quranic exegete, jurist, and scholar whose contributions span multiple disciplines.

## Life and Education

Born in Amol in the Tabaristan region of northern Iran (hence the name al-Tabari), he began his education at an early age, displaying remarkable intelligence and memory. He traveled extensively in pursuit of knowledge, studying in centers of learning across the Islamic world including Ray, Baghdad, Basra, Kufa, and Egypt. His teachers included the most renowned scholars of his time, and he collected materials and traditions directly from eyewitnesses and their descendants.

Despite offers of official positions and patronage, al-Tabari maintained his independence as a scholar, living modestly in Baghdad where he taught and wrote until his death in 923 CE.

## Historical Methodology

Al-Tabari's approach to history established new standards for Islamic historiography:

### Isnad System

He meticulously applied the hadith methodology of isnad (chain of transmission) to historical reports, listing the complete chain of narrators for each account and often presenting multiple versions of the same event.

### Comprehensive Chronology

His history follows a strict annalistic approach, organizing events year by year from creation to his own time, with particular emphasis on the Islamic era.

### Compilation without Selection

Al-Tabari often presented contradictory accounts of events without explicitly judging between them, famously stating: "We have merely reported what has been reported to us." This approach preserved a wealth of material that might otherwise have been lost.

### Breadth of Coverage

His work encompasses pre-Islamic history, detailed accounts of the Prophet Muhammad's life, the early caliphates, and events up to 915 CE, offering unparalleled breadth and detail for the formative period of Islamic history.

## Tarikh al-Tabari (History of the Prophets and Kings)

This massive historical chronicle, originally comprising approximately 30 volumes, covers:

- Biblical and ancient histories, including Persian and pre-Islamic Arabian accounts
- A detailed biography of Prophet Muhammad
- The caliphates of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali
- The Umayyad dynasty (661-750 CE)
- The Abbasid dynasty until 915 CE

The work is particularly valuable for its extensive coverage of the first fitna (civil war) among Muslims, the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, and court politics in Baghdad. It preserves accounts from earlier historians whose works have been lost, including Ibn Ishaq, al-Waqidi, and al-Mada'ini.

## Impact and Legacy

Al-Tabari's historical work had profound and lasting influence:

- It established a model for comprehensive historical writing that influenced generations of Muslim historians
- Later historians like Ibn al-Athir, Ibn Kathir, and Ibn Khaldun drew heavily from his materials
- It preserved numerous accounts from earlier sources that would otherwise have been lost
- It remains the most authoritative source for early Islamic history, especially the period of the early caliphates
- Modern historians still consider it essential for reconstructing the first three centuries of Islamic history

Though parts of the original Arabic text were lost over time, what remains has been critically edited and translated into multiple languages, making al-Tabari's historical narratives accessible to scholars worldwide.

## Scholarly Context

Al-Tabari's historical writing cannot be separated from his broader scholarly identity. His works on Quranic exegesis, jurisprudence, and history were interconnected projects that aimed to establish authentic knowledge about Islam's formative period. His historical work particularly complemented his Quranic commentary by providing detailed context for many Quranic verses and their circumstances of revelation.
