Ibn al-Haytham (c. 965-1040 CE), known in the West as Alhazen, was a pioneering Arab scientist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who made significant contributions to the understanding of optics, astronomy, mathematics, and the scientific method. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the medieval Islamic world and is often referred to as the "father of modern optics."

## Life and Career

Born in Basra (in present-day Iraq) during the height of the Islamic Golden Age, Ibn al-Haytham received an excellent education in the sciences, mathematics, and philosophy. His intellectual career took him from Iraq to Egypt, where he lived during the Fatimid Caliphate under Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah.

A famous story relates that Ibn al-Haytham was invited to Egypt by the Fatimid Caliph to implement a plan to regulate the flooding of the Nile. Upon realizing the impracticality of the project, Ibn al-Haytham feared the Caliph's reaction and feigned madness to avoid punishment. During this supposed period of house arrest, he conducted many of his groundbreaking scientific experiments.

While the details of this story remain debated among historians, what is certain is that Ibn al-Haytham spent significant time in Cairo, where he wrote his most important works and conducted his experimental research.

## Contributions to Optics

Ibn al-Haytham's most significant scientific achievement was his comprehensive work on optics, "Kitab al-Manazir" (Book of Optics), written around 1011-1021 CE:

- Refuted the ancient Greek emission theory of vision (that visual rays emanate from the eyes) and correctly proposed that vision occurs when light reflects from objects and enters the eyes
- Provided the first correct explanation of how vision works, integrating anatomical, physical, and mathematical aspects
- Conducted systematic experiments with light, including studies of reflection, refraction, and the nature of light rays
- Described the camera obscura phenomenon in detail, correctly explaining how images are formed
- Investigated atmospheric refraction, explaining why the sun and moon appear larger near the horizon
- Studied the rainbow, shadows, eclipses, and other optical phenomena

His work on optics remained the most authoritative text on the subject for over 600 years and was highly influential in both the Islamic world and Europe after its translation into Latin.

## Scientific Method

Perhaps Ibn al-Haytham's most enduring legacy was his approach to scientific inquiry, which emphasized several principles that would later become fundamental to the scientific method:

- Insisted on systematic experimentation as a way to verify theoretical models
- Emphasized the importance of empirical evidence over reliance on established authority
- Developed a methodology of controlled testing and careful observation
- Applied mathematical models to physical phenomena
- Maintained a healthy skepticism toward his own hypotheses and those of others

His approach represented a significant departure from earlier scientific practices and anticipated many aspects of the scientific revolution that would occur centuries later in Europe.

## Mathematics and Astronomy

Beyond optics, Ibn al-Haytham made substantial contributions to mathematics and astronomy:

- Solved various geometric and algebraic problems, including work on the volumes of paraboloids
- Contributed to early development of analytic geometry
- Worked on number theory and the beginnings of what would later become calculus
- Developed mathematical models for the movements of the planets
- Provided a critique of the Ptolemaic model of the universe
- Accurately described the physical attributes of the Milky Way

## Other Scientific Contributions

Ibn al-Haytham's intellect ranged across numerous scientific fields:

- Conducted studies in mechanics, including the mechanics of motion
- Explored problems in fluid dynamics
- Contributed to the understanding of atmospheric phenomena
- Made observations about the physics of mirrors and lenses
- Engaged with problems in psychology related to visual perception and optical illusions

## Philosophical Thought

As a philosopher, Ibn al-Haytham addressed questions about:

- The nature of knowledge and how humans acquire understanding
- The relationship between mathematics and physical reality
- The limitations of human perception and knowledge
- Methodological questions about scientific inquiry
- The reconciliation of rational investigation with religious faith

He emphasized that the pursuit of truth required both mathematical reasoning and empirical observation, positioning him as an early advocate for what would now be considered a scientific worldview.

## Legacy and Influence

Ibn al-Haytham's influence extended far beyond his lifetime:

- His Book of Optics was translated into Latin as "De Aspectibus" or "Perspectiva" in the late 12th or early 13th century
- European scholars like Roger Bacon, Witelo, and Johannes Kepler built directly on his optical work
- His experimental method influenced the development of science during the European Renaissance
- Modern historians of science recognize him as a pivotal figure in the history of the scientific method
- The lunar crater "Alhazen" is named in his honor
- UNESCO declared 2015 the International Year of Light, partly commemorating the 1000th anniversary of his Book of Optics
