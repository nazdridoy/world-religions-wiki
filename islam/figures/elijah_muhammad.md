Elijah Muhammad (born Elijah Robert Poole, October 7, 1897 â€“ February 25, 1975) was the leader of the Nation of Islam (NOI) from 1934 until his death in 1975. As the principal architect of the NOI's theology and organizational structure, he transformed a small, obscure religious movement into a powerful force in American society that attracted hundreds of thousands of followers. His teachings, which blended elements of traditional Islamic practices with a distinctive Black nationalist ideology, remain controversial within mainstream Islam yet profoundly influential in the development of Black consciousness and identity in 20th century America.

## Early Life and Conversion

Elijah Muhammad's early experiences shaped his later religious and political outlook:

- Born in Sandersville, Georgia, to sharecroppers Willie and Mariah Poole
- One of thirteen children in an impoverished family
- Received only about four years of formal education
- Worked from childhood in the fields and sawmills of the Jim Crow South
- Witnessed brutal racial violence and oppression in early 20th century Georgia
- Married Clara Evans in 1919, eventually having eight children together
- Migrated to Detroit, Michigan, in 1923 during the Great Migration
- Worked in the auto factories until the Great Depression
- Experienced urban poverty and racial discrimination in the industrial North
- First encountered the teachings of W.D. Fard (Wallace D. Fard Muhammad) in 1931
- Became a devoted follower and received the Muslim name "Elijah Muhammad"
- Appointed as a minister and close assistant to Fard

His background of poverty, limited education, and experience with racial oppression provided the context for his receptivity to Fard's unconventional religious message that centered Black identity and dignity.

## Leadership of the Nation of Islam

After W.D. Fard's mysterious disappearance in 1934, Elijah Muhammad assumed leadership of the fledgling organization:

- Declared Fard to be Allah in human form and himself as the "Messenger of Allah"
- Relocated to Chicago after facing threats in Detroit
- Established Temple No. 2 in Chicago as the NOI headquarters
- Built the organization despite internal leadership struggles
- Arrested in 1942 for draft evasion and opposition to World War II
- Imprisoned from 1942 to 1946, using this time to recruit and consolidate power
- Systematized NOI teachings and practices after his release
- Developed economic enterprises including farms, stores, and restaurants
- Founded the newspaper "Muhammad Speaks" in 1960
- Established Muhammad University of Islam schools
- Built mosques (called "temples") across major American cities
- Mentored important figures including Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan
- Created a strict moral and behavioral code for followers
- Built the organization to an estimated 100,000+ members by the 1960s
- Accumulated considerable personal wealth from organizational resources
- Maintained leadership until his death despite health challenges

Under his leadership, the Nation of Islam developed from a small cult into a nationwide organization with significant economic, social, and political influence.

## Theological Teachings

Elijah Muhammad's religious teachings diverged significantly from mainstream Islam:

### Distinctive Doctrines

- Taught that W.D. Fard was Allah incarnate who appeared in human form
- Claimed Black people were the original humans and the chosen people of Allah
- Portrayed whites as "devils" genetically engineered by an evil scientist named Yakub
- Predicted an apocalyptic end to white domination and the ascendance of Black people
- Positioned himself as the divinely appointed "Messenger of Allah"
- Rejected the concept of an afterlife, focusing on racial liberation in this world
- Reinterpreted Islamic concepts through a racial lens
- Emphasized the "hidden history" of Black people suppressed by white supremacy
- Developed an origin myth involving a "Mother Plane" or UFO that would eventually destroy white civilization
- Created a historical narrative placing the origin of all civilization in Black people

### Islamic Practices and Modifications

- Adopted selective Islamic practices including prayer, modest dress, and dietary restrictions
- Modified traditional Islamic prayer rituals and practices
- Instituted dietary laws that prohibited pork, alcohol, and certain other foods
- Required members to pray facing Chicago rather than Mecca

- Initially rejected the Arabic language in favor of English
- Later introduced some Arabic terms and practices
- Did not require traditional Islamic knowledge or study of classical texts
- Discouraged pilgrimage to Mecca until later in his leadership
- Created a distinctive American Black Muslim culture and identity

These teachings were rejected by orthodox Muslims worldwide but provided a powerful counter-narrative to white Christian supremacy for many African Americans seeking dignity and identity.

Beyond theology, Elijah Muhammad implemented a comprehensive program for Black advancement:

This comprehensive program provided structure, purpose, and practical benefits that attracted many followers beyond the theological aspects of the movement.

## Relationship with Malcolm X

The relationship between Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X was central to the NOI's development:

- Malcolm X (Malcolm Little) was converted to the NOI while in prison
- Elijah Muhammad recognized Malcolm's exceptional intellect and oratorical skills
- Appointed Malcolm as a minister and national representative
- Mentored Malcolm and treated him as a surrogate son
- Benefited enormously from Malcolm's recruitment efforts and public speaking
- Relied on Malcolm to represent the NOI to the media and broader public
- The relationship deteriorated after Malcolm learned of Elijah's extramarital affairs
- Tensions increased when Malcolm commented on President Kennedy's assassination
- Officially silenced Malcolm for 90 days in 1963
- Permanently broke with Malcolm when he left the NOI in 1964
- Allegedly authorized threats against Malcolm's life
- Malcolm's assassination in 1965 was widely believed to be ordered by NOI leadership
- Later denied involvement in Malcolm's murder
- The break with Malcolm represented a significant loss to the organization
- Their complex relationship has been the subject of numerous books and films

This dramatic relationship and its tragic end represent one of the most significant chapters in American religious and political history.
