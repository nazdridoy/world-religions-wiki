# Prophet Muhammad

![Prophet Muhammad](../../images/muhammad.jpg)

Muhammad ibn Abdullah (570-632 CE) is the founder of Islam and is considered by Muslims to be the final prophet of God (Allah). As the central figure of Islam, Muhammad is regarded as the perfect example of how a Muslim should live, and his life and teachings form the foundation of Islamic religious practice and moral conduct.

## Early Life

Born in Mecca (present-day Saudi Arabia) around 570 CE, Muhammad was orphaned at a young age. His father Abdullah died before his birth, and his mother Aminah died when he was six years old. He was subsequently raised by his grandfather Abd al-Muttalib and later by his uncle Abu Talib.

As a young man, Muhammad worked as a merchant and became known for his honesty, earning the title "al-Amin" (the Trustworthy). At the age of 25, he married Khadijah, a wealthy widow and merchant who was 15 years his senior. Their marriage was monogamous for 25 years until Khadijah's death.

## Prophethood and Revelation

At the age of 40, in 610 CE, while meditating in a cave called Hira near Mecca, Muhammad reported receiving his first revelation from the angel Gabriel (Jibril). These revelations continued over the next 23 years and were later compiled into the Quran, the holy book of Islam.

Initially, Muhammad preached privately, then publicly proclaimed his message of monotheism in polytheistic Mecca. His early followers faced persecution, and in 622 CE, Muhammad and his companions migrated to Medina (the Hijra), marking the beginning of the Islamic calendar.

## Establishment of the Islamic State

In Medina, Muhammad established the first Muslim community (ummah) and served as its religious, political, and military leader. He created a constitution (the Charter of Medina) that defined the relationships between different groups within the city, including Muslims, Jews, and pagans.

Over the next decade, Muhammad consolidated power throughout Arabia through a combination of military campaigns, strategic alliances, and conversions. By the time of his death in 632 CE, most of the Arabian Peninsula had embraced Islam.

## Character and Personal Life

Muhammad's character is central to Islamic understanding of virtuous conduct. Muslims regard him as exemplifying:

- **Mercy and compassion**: He was known for his kindness even toward enemies
- **Simplicity**: Despite his position, he lived a modest life
- **Justice**: He established equal treatment under law regardless of social status
- **Wisdom**: His judgments and governance showed insight and fairness
- **Courage**: He personally participated in battles to defend the Muslim community
- **Devotion**: His spiritual practice was intense and consistent

After Khadijah's death, Muhammad married several women for various political, social, and compassionate reasons, which was common practice for leaders in that era.

## Teachings and Legacy

Muhammad's teachings emphasized:

- Absolute monotheism (tawhid)
- Regular prayer and remembrance of God
- Charity and care for the less fortunate
- Social justice and equality of all believers
- Moral and ethical conduct in all aspects of life

His legacy includes:
