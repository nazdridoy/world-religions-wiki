# Mirza Ghulam Ahmad

![Mirza Ghulam Ahmad](../../images/mirza_ghulam_ahmad.jpg)

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908) was an Indian religious leader who founded the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam in 1889. He claimed to be the promised Messiah and Mahdi awaited by Muslims as well as the metaphorical return of Jesus Christ. His claims generated significant controversy in the Islamic world, with mainstream Muslims rejecting his prophetic claims as contrary to the Islamic doctrine of Muhammad as the final prophet (Khatam an-Nabiyyin). Today, the Ahmadiyya community has millions of adherents worldwide but faces persecution in many Muslim-majority countries.

## Early Life and Background

Born on February 13, 1835, in Qadian, Punjab (now in India) into a noble Mughal family, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was raised in a period of significant religious and political change in South Asia. His family had lost much of its former wealth and status but maintained respect in the region. Key aspects of his early life include:

- **Education**: Received traditional Islamic education at home, studying the Quran, Arabic, Persian, and traditional medicine
- **Spiritual Inclination**: Showed early interest in religious studies and spent much time in prayer and meditation
- **British Colonial Context**: Matured during the aftermath of the 1857 Indian Rebellion and the consolidation of British colonial rule
- **Religious Environment**: Lived in a time of intense Christian missionary activity, Hindu revivalist movements, and internal Muslim debates about reform

In his early adulthood, Ahmad worked briefly as a clerk in the British administration before devoting himself to religious pursuits. He gained initial recognition through his writings defending Islam against the criticisms of Hindu reformists, Christian missionaries, and the emerging Arya Samaj movement.

## Claims and Mission

Ahmad's mission developed gradually, with increasingly significant claims over time:

1. **Early Period (1880-1889)**: Began writing works defending Islam, notably his multi-volume *Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya*
2. **Initial Claims (1889)**: Announced his claim to be the Mujaddid (reformer) of the 14th Islamic century
3. **Further Claims (1891)**: Declared himself to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi
4. **Bay'ah (Pledge of Allegiance)**: Formally established his community by accepting the first pledge of allegiance from followers in Ludhiana
5. **Later Claims**: Described himself as a "reflection" or "shadow" prophet subordinate to Muhammad

Ahmad based his claims on his interpretation of Quranic verses, hadith, and what he described as divine revelations received directly from God. He argued that Jesus had survived the crucifixion, traveled to Kashmir where he died a natural death, and that the promised second coming was to be fulfilled metaphorically through Ahmad himself.

## Key Theological Positions

Ahmad's theology included several distinctive elements that set his movement apart:

- **Jesus in Kashmir**: Claimed that Jesus survived crucifixion and migrated to Kashmir, where he died a natural death and is buried in Srinagar
- **Metaphorical Second Coming**: Interpreted the promised return of Jesus as metaphorical, fulfilled through Ahmad himself
- **Non-Abrogation of Prophecy**: Maintained that while Muhammad was the final law-bearing prophet, subordinate prophecy within the framework of Islam could continue
- **Peaceful Jihad**: Rejected militant interpretations of jihad in favor of a spiritual struggle through argumentation and writing
- **Islamic Revivalism**: Sought to restore what he viewed as the original, peaceful message of Islam
- **Integration of Rationality**: Emphasized the compatibility of science, rationality, and religion

## Writings and Works

Ahmad was a prolific writer, authoring more than 90 books and thousands of letters, mostly in Urdu, Arabic, and Persian. His major works include:

- **Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya**: His early magnum opus defending Islam against various critiques
- **Philosophy of the Teachings of Islam**: Presented at the Conference of Great Religions in Lahore
- **Jesus in India**: Outlining his theory on Jesus's survival of crucifixion and journey to Kashmir
- **The Victory of Islam**: Describing his vision for Islamic revival
- **Haqiqat-ul-Wahi**: Detailing his understanding of divine revelation

His writings cover theological issues, polemics against other religions, interpretations of Islamic doctrine, and prophecies he claimed to have received.

## Opposition and Controversies

Ahmad's claims generated immediate and ongoing controversy within the Islamic world:

- **Prophetic Status**: His claimed status as a type of prophet contradicted the mainstream Muslim belief in Muhammad as the final prophet
- **Jesus's Death**: His teaching that Jesus died a natural death opposed the traditional Islamic belief in Jesus's bodily ascension to heaven
- **Interpretations of Jihad**: His pacifistic reinterpretation of jihad was criticized as serving British colonial interests
- **Legal Declarations**: Many Muslim scholars issued fatwas declaring him a heretic
- **Polemical Exchanges**: He engaged in heated debates with Christian missionaries, Hindu reformers, and orthodox Muslim scholars

These controversies culminated in mainstream Muslim rejection of the Ahmadiyya movement as heretical, a position that continues to this day in most Muslim countries.

## The Ahmadiyya Movement After Ahmad

Following Ahmad's death in 1908 from natural causes, the movement he founded continued under the leadership system he established:

- **Khalifat-ul-Masih**: The successorship institution, beginning with Hakeem Nooruddin as the first caliph
- **1914 Split**: Division into the Qadiani and Lahori branches over the interpretation of Ahmad's prophetic claims
- **Growth and Missions**: Expansion through missionary activities in Africa, Europe, and America
- **Persecution**: Increasing opposition in Muslim countries, culminating in Pakistan's 1974 constitutional amendment declaring Ahmadis non-Muslims and the 1984 Ordinance XX prohibiting them from identifying as Muslims

Today, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community claims tens of millions of adherents globally, maintains headquarters in London, and is known for its emphasis on peace, tolerance, and humanitarian work, though these numbers are disputed by critics.

## Contemporary Status

In the modern world, the Ahmadiyya movement:

- **Faces Legal Restrictions**: Declared non-Muslim in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and other countries
- **Experiences Persecution**: Subjected to discrimination, violence, and legal constraints in many Muslim-majority nations
- **Maintains Active Missions**: Conducts significant missionary and translation work globally
- **Engages in Humanitarian Efforts**: Operates hospitals, schools, and disaster relief through organizations like Humanity First
- **Advocates Religious Freedom**: Campaigns for religious liberty and human rights

The movement remains highly organized under its current leader, the fifth Khalifa Mirza Masroor Ahmad, who resides in London due to persecution in Pakistan.
