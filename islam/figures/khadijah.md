# Khadijah bint Khuwaylid

![Khadijah bint Khuwaylid](../../images/khadijah.jpg)

Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (555-619 CE) was the first wife of Prophet Muhammad and the first person to accept Islam. A successful businesswoman and respected figure in Meccan society, she played a crucial role in supporting Muhammad during the early years of his prophethood, offering emotional, spiritual, and financial backing when he faced rejection and persecution.

## Early Life and Business Success

Born to Khuwaylid ibn Asad and Fatimah bint Za'idah, members of the prestigious Quraysh tribe in Mecca, Khadijah was raised in a noble and wealthy family. After being widowed twice, she took charge of her inherited business and developed it into a highly successful trading enterprise. 

Khadijah was known as "al-Tahira" (the Pure One) and "Ameerat-Quraysh" (Princess of Quraysh) due to her exemplary character, business acumen, and noble lineage. Despite receiving many marriage proposals from prominent men of Mecca, she remained independent, managing her caravans and trade that extended from Mecca to Syria and Yemen.

## Relationship with Muhammad

Khadijah first encountered Muhammad when she hired him to manage her trading caravan to Syria. Impressed by reports of his honesty, trustworthiness, and successful business dealings, she developed respect for the young merchant who was 15 years her junior.

Their relationship progressed from employer-employee to marriage after Khadijah proposed to Muhammad when he was 25 and she was around 40. Their marriage was characterized by:

- **Monogamy**: Muhammad remained married only to Khadijah for 25 years until her death, despite polygamy being common in their society
- **Partnership**: They shared a mutual respect and consultative relationship
- **Family Life**: They had six children together: sons Al-Qasim and Abdullah (both died in infancy), and daughters Zainab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum, and Fatimah
- **Emotional Support**: Khadijah provided comfort and reassurance during Muhammad's spiritual experiences and challenges

## The First Muslim

When Muhammad received his first revelation in the Cave of Hira around 610 CE, he returned home trembling and distressed. Khadijah's response demonstrated her extraordinary character and faith:

1. She comforted him physically and emotionally
2. She assured him that God would not humiliate him because of his good character
3. She consulted her Christian cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal for insight
4. She became the first person to accept Muhammad's message and embrace Islam

Her immediate acceptance without hesitation gave Muhammad crucial support during a period of immense uncertainty and provided validation when he most needed it.

## Support During Persecution

As Muhammad began to preach Islam publicly and face increasing hostility from Meccan society, Khadijah stood firmly behind him:

- **Financial Support**: Her wealth was used to support the early Muslim community, free slaves who had converted to Islam, and provide for those boycotted by Meccan society
- **Social Protection**: Her standing in Meccan society offered Muhammad some protection from the worst persecution
- **Unwavering Faith**: Her steadfast belief strengthened Muhammad's resolve in the face of rejection
- **Sacrifices**: She endured the harsh conditions of the boycott imposed on Muslims by the Quraysh, contributing to her declining health

## Death and Legacy

Khadijah died in 619 CE at the age of approximately 64, about three years before the Hijra (migration to Medina). Her death, along with the death of Muhammad's uncle and protector Abu Talib around the same time, marked a period so difficult that Muhammad referred to it as "the Year of Sorrow."

Muhammad continued to honor Khadijah's memory long after her death:

- He frequently mentioned her virtues and contributions
- He maintained relationships with her friends
- He would honor gifts that came from her friends particularly highly
- His later wife Aisha noted that she was never jealous of any of the Prophet's wives except Khadijah, whom she never met, because of how often Muhammad would praise her

## Significance in Islam

Khadijah holds a special place in Islamic tradition:

- **First Muslim**: The first person to accept Islam and pray with Muhammad
- **Mother of the Believers**: Honored title as Muhammad's wife
- **Ideal Exemplar**: Model of female faith, courage, and support
- **Perfected Woman**: Named by Muhammad as one of the four "perfect women" in human history
- **Maternal Legacy**: Through her daughter Fatimah, she is the maternal ancestor of the Prophet's descendants (Sayyids and Sharifs)

She is especially significant for Muslim women as an example of a successful businesswoman, independent thinker, loving wife, and devoted believer who played a crucial role in the establishment of a major world religion.
