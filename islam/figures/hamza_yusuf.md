![Hamza Yusuf](../../images/hamza_yusuf.jpg)

Hamza Yusuf (born Mark Hanson in 1958) is one of the most influential and prominent Islamic scholars in the Western world. As an American convert to Islam, educator, author, and co-founder of Zaytuna College—the first accredited Muslim liberal arts college in the United States—he has played a pivotal role in shaping contemporary Islamic thought and education in the West while building bridges between Islamic scholarship and Western society.

## Early Life and Conversion

Hamza Yusuf's journey to becoming a leading Islamic scholar began with his personal transformation:

- Born Mark Hanson in 1958 in Washington state to academic parents
- Raised in Northern California in a Greek Orthodox Christian environment
- Experienced a near-fatal car accident at age 17 that prompted existential questioning
- Began exploring various religious traditions, including Eastern religions
- Discovered Islam through a book about prayer while traveling
- Converted to Islam at age 18 (1977) after being deeply moved by the Quran's message
- Changed his name to Hamza Yusuf after his conversion

His background as a Western-born convert with a deep understanding of both Western and Islamic intellectual traditions would later become a defining feature of his approach to Islamic scholarship.

## Traditional Islamic Education

Unlike many Western Muslims, Yusuf pursued a rigorous traditional Islamic education:

- Traveled to the United Arab Emirates and then to North Africa to study with traditional scholars
- Spent four years studying in the United Arab Emirates
- Moved to North Africa where he continued his studies for several more years
- Became a student of renowned Mauritanian scholar Sheikh Murabit al-Hajj
- Studied in the desert in the traditional way, memorizing texts and learning directly from scholars
- Mastered classical Arabic and traditional Islamic sciences including jurisprudence, theology, and Quranic exegesis
- Also studied logic, rhetoric, and medicine according to traditional Islamic curricula

This traditional training in the Islamic sciences, rare among Western Muslims, gave him substantial credibility in both Muslim and non-Muslim circles and became the foundation for his later educational initiatives.

## Return to America and Early Work

After returning to the United States in the late 1980s, Yusuf began his mission of education and outreach:

- Served as imam at the Santa Clara Mosque in California
- Founded Zaytuna Institute in 1996 as an educational organization dedicated to reviving traditional Islamic sciences
- Began producing audio lectures that gained wide circulation among English-speaking Muslims
- Emerged as a sought-after speaker at Islamic events throughout North America and beyond
- Became known for eloquent, accessible explanations of complex Islamic concepts
- Emphasized a traditional, mainstream understanding of Islam that rejected extremism
- Advocated for Muslims to be engaged citizens while maintaining their religious identity

His articulate presentations of Islamic teachings, delivered with references to both Islamic and Western intellectual traditions, resonated strongly with educated Muslims living in Western societies.

## Post-9/11 Public Role

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, thrust Yusuf into a more prominent public role:

- Condemned the attacks unequivocally as violations of Islamic principles
- Met with President George W. Bush at the White House along with other Muslim leaders
- Became an important voice explaining Islam to non-Muslim Americans during a time of heightened suspicion
- Advocated against the Iraq War and spoke out against violations of civil liberties
- Emphasized the peaceful nature of mainstream Islam while acknowledging the need for internal reform
- Worked to counter both Islamophobia and extremist interpretations of Islam
- Engaged with media outlets to provide nuanced perspectives on complex issues

This period marked his emergence as not just a religious scholar but also a public intellectual addressing contemporary political and social issues from an Islamic perspective.

## Founding of Zaytuna College

Yusuf's most significant institutional achievement has been the establishment of Zaytuna College:

- Co-founded Zaytuna College in 2009 with scholars Zaid Shakir and Hatem Bazian
