Abul A'la Maududi (1903-1979) was an influential Islamic scholar, theologian, and political philosopher from the Indian subcontinent who founded the Jamaat-e-Islami, one of the most significant Islamic revivalist movements of the 20th century. His comprehensive vision of Islam as a complete system of life and governance has profoundly shaped Islamist political thought across the Muslim world. Through his prolific writings and organizational leadership, Maududi articulated a systematic ideology that sought to transform Muslim societies according to his understanding of Islamic principles.

## Early Life and Intellectual Formation

Born on September 25, 1903, in Aurangabad, then part of the Hyderabad Deccan state in British India, Maududi came from a family with a distinguished religious lineage:

- His father, Ahmad Hasan Maududi, was a lawyer who later abandoned his profession to pursue a spiritual path
- He received a traditional Islamic education at home rather than attending a modern school
- As a young man, he learned Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, as well as Islamic studies from private tutors
- He began working as a journalist at age 15 after his father's death created financial pressures
- His early intellectual development occurred during a turbulent period in Indian Muslim history, marked by the collapse of Ottoman Caliphate and the rise of Hindu nationalism

These formative experiences shaped his concern for the preservation of Islamic identity in the face of Western colonialism and secularism.

## Journalistic Career and Early Activism

Before establishing himself as a religious theorist, Maududi worked as a journalist and editor for several publications:

- He edited the newspaper *Taj* in Jabalpur at age 17
- He served as editor of *Muslim* (1921-23), the official newspaper of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind
- In 1925, he became editor of *al-Jamiah*, a newspaper in Delhi
- He published his first major book, *al-Jihad fil-Islam* (Jihad in Islam) in 1927
- In the early 1930s, he began editing *Tarjuman al-Qur'an*, a journal that became his primary platform for articulating his Islamic vision

During this period, Maududi developed from a nationalist supporting the Indian independence movement to a proponent of a distinct Islamic identity and political system.

## Ideological Framework

Maududi developed a comprehensive Islamic ideology characterized by several core principles:

### Concept of Hakimiyyah (God's Sovereignty)

- **Divine Authority**: Sovereignty belongs exclusively to Allah, not to any human individual or collective
- **Islamic State**: The state must implement God's law (Sharia) as the supreme legal framework
- **Rejection of Democracy**: Opposition to Western democracy based on the view that it places human will above divine law
- **Theo-democracy**: Advocacy for a constrained democratic system operating within Islamic boundaries

### Critique of Contemporary Systems

- **"Modern Jahiliyyah"**: Characterized modern society as a form of pre-Islamic ignorance
- **Rejection of Secularism**: Criticized the separation of religion from politics and public life
- **Anti-Westernism**: Opposed cultural and political influences from Western powers
- **Critique of Traditional Scholarship**: Challenged what he saw as the stagnation of traditional ulama (religious scholars)

### Social and Cultural Vision

- **Comprehensive System**: Portrayed Islam as a complete code for personal, social, economic, and political life
- **Moral Reform**: Emphasized the need for individual moral transformation as the basis for societal change
- **Education**: Advocated for Islamic education to counter Western and secular influences
- **Gender Roles**: Promoted distinct and complementary roles for men and women within an Islamic framework

## Founding of Jamaat-e-Islami

In 1941, Maududi established the Jamaat-e-Islami in Lahore as an organization to implement his vision:

- It was conceived as a vanguard movement to transform society through education and political activism
- The organization emphasized ideological training and moral discipline of its members
- It operated as a cadre-based party with strict membership requirements
- After the partition of India in 1947, the organization split into separate Indian and Pakistani branches
- Under his leadership, Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan became a significant political and social force

The organization became the vehicle for translating Maududi's theoretical work into practical activism across the subcontinent and beyond.

## Literary Contributions

Maududi was a prolific author whose works have been translated into numerous languages:

- **Tafhim al-Qur'an** (Towards Understanding the Quran): His magnum opus, a comprehensive Quranic commentary completed over 30 years
- **Islamic Law and Constitution**: Outlined his vision of an Islamic state and legal system
- **Purdah and the Status of Woman in Islam**: Presented his views on gender roles and separation
- **The Four Basic Quranic Terms**: Analyzed key concepts that form the foundation of Islamic worldview
- **Economic System of Islam**: Proposed an Islamic alternative to capitalism and socialism

His clear, accessible writing style helped popularize complex Islamic concepts among educated Muslims who lacked traditional religious training.

## Political Activism and Persecution

Maududi's political activities in Pakistan led to repeated conflicts with the government:

- He opposed Pakistan's first constitution as insufficiently Islamic
- In 1953, he was sentenced to death for his alleged role in anti-Ahmadiyya riots (later commuted and eventually pardoned)
- He was imprisoned several times under various Pakistani regimes
- During the 1970s, he supported the Pakistan National Alliance against Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government
- Despite persecution, he maintained his advocacy for an Islamic state and constitution

His willingness to face imprisonment and even execution enhanced his credibility among supporters as a principled leader.

## Global Influence and Legacy

Maududi's influence extended far beyond South Asia:

- His works were translated into Arabic and influenced major figures in the Arab world, including Sayyid Qutb
- His ideological framework shaped various Islamic movements across the Muslim world
- His conceptualization of an Islamic state influenced constitutional discussions in several Muslim-majority countries
- His methodological approach to understanding Islam as a comprehensive system continues to resonate with Islamist movements
- Contemporary Islamic political parties in numerous countries reflect his vision and organizational model

He died on September 22, 1979, in the United States, where he had gone for medical treatment. His funeral in Lahore was attended by an estimated one million people, demonstrating his significant popular following.

## Critical Assessment

Maududi's legacy remains contested:

- Supporters view him as a visionary who articulated a comprehensive Islamic alternative to Western ideologies
- Critics argue that his interpretation of Islam was overly politicized and departed from traditional understandings
- Some scholars note tensions between his emphasis on divine sovereignty and democratic participation
- His influence on militant movements has been debated, with some seeing his ideas as inspiring extremism and others viewing him as a moderate voice
- Liberal Muslims have criticized his positions on women's rights and religious pluralism

Despite these controversies, his systematic approach to Islamic thought and his organizational legacy ensure his continued relevance in contemporary Islamic discourse.
