# The Muqaddimah - Ibn Khaldun's Introduction to History

![Manuscript page from the Muqaddimah](muqaddimah_image.jpg)

The Muqaddimah ("Introduction" or "Prolegomena") stands as one of the most innovative and influential works in Islamic intellectual history and world scholarship. Composed by the North African polymath Abd al-Rahman Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406 CE) as the prologue to his universal history "Kitab al-Ibar" (Book of Lessons), this groundbreaking text transcends traditional historiography by establishing a scientific approach to studying human civilization. Through careful observation and rational analysis, Ibn Khaldun developed pioneering theories of social cohesion, economic development, state formation, and cyclical history that anticipated many modern social sciences by centuries. The Muqaddimah represents a watershed in Islamic intellectual tradition and continues to be recognized globally as a foundational text in historical methodology, sociology, economics, and political science.
