# Aqida Literature - Statements of Islamic Creed

![Islamic manuscript with creedal texts](aqida_literature_image.jpg)

Aqida (عقيدة), meaning "creed" or "belief," refers to the foundational statements of Islamic faith that articulate the core tenets of Muslim belief. Aqida literature encompasses a wide array of texts, from concise summaries of doctrine to extensive theological treatises, all aimed at systematically outlining the essential articles of faith. These texts emerged and developed throughout Islamic history to clarify orthodox positions, refute heterodox views, and provide a clear framework for understanding God, prophethood, divine books, angels, the Day of Judgment, and divine decree. Serving as an intellectual and spiritual anchor, Aqida literature has played a crucial role in shaping Islamic thought, preserving doctrinal purity, and guiding the understanding of Muslims across diverse schools and traditions.
