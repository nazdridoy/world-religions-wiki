# Al-Muwatta - The Well-Trodden Path of Imam Malik

![Manuscript page of Al-Muwatta](muwatta_image.jpg)

*Al-Muwatta* ("The Well-Trodden Path") stands as one of the earliest and most revered compilations of Islamic legal traditions, authored by Imam Malik ibn Anas (711-795 CE), the founder of the Maliki school of jurisprudence. This pioneering work represents the first successful attempt to codify Islamic law based on the practice of Medina's scholarly community, which Malik considered the most authentic living tradition of the Prophet Muhammad's teachings. Combining hadith (prophetic traditions), athƒÅr (companion reports), and legal opinions, *Al-Muwatta* established a methodological framework that profoundly influenced subsequent Islamic legal literature and remains a cornerstone text in Islamic jurisprudential studies.
