# Fiqh Akbar - The Great Theology of Abu Hanifa

![Manuscript page of Fiqh Akbar](fiqh_akbar_image.jpg)

*Fiqh Akbar* (The Great Theology) represents one of the earliest and most influential systematic statements of Islamic creed, traditionally attributed to Imam Abu Hanifa (699-767 CE), the eponymous founder of the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence. This concise yet comprehensive theological treatise addresses foundational questions of belief concerning divine attributes, prophethood, predestination, faith, and eschatology. Despite scholarly debates regarding its exact attribution and dating, *Fiqh Akbar* has played a pivotal role in shaping Sunni theological discourse, particularly within the Maturidi tradition that emerged from Abu Hanifa's theological legacy.
