The early Sufi writings constitute a distinctive literary corpus that emerged from the 8th to 12th centuries CE, documenting the foundational principles, spiritual experiences, and methodological approaches of Islamic mysticism's formative period. These texts represent the first systematic articulations of Sufi thought, transforming what began as an ascetic movement into a sophisticated spiritual tradition with its own technical vocabulary, psychological insights, and metaphysical framework. Written during a period when Sufism was establishing its legitimacy within the broader Islamic tradition, these works carefully positioned mystical experience in relation to scriptural authority and legal orthodoxy while exploring the inner dimensions of religious practice. The pioneering authors—many revered as saints—created a literary legacy that would profoundly shape Islamic spirituality, poetry, philosophy, and social organization for centuries to come.
