# Hadith Qudsi - Divine Sayings

![Collection of Hadith Qudsi manuscripts](hadith_qudsi_image.jpg)

Hadith Qudsi (Sacred Hadith) represent a unique category of prophetic traditions in Islam where the content is attributed to Allah while the wording comes through the Prophet Muhammad. Unlike the Quran, which is considered the direct word of Allah in both meaning and wording, Hadith Qudsi occupy an intermediate position in Islamic textual hierarchyâ€”they are divine in their meaning but expressed through the Prophet's words. These special narrations reveal intimate aspects of divine mercy, guidance, and the relationship between Creator and creation.

## Definition and Classification

### Distinctive Characteristics
- **Divine Attribution**: The Prophet Muhammad prefaced these sayings with phrases like "Allah says" or "Allah, Mighty and Exalted, says"
- **Non-Quranic Status**: Despite divine attribution, they are not considered part of the Quran
- **Special Authority**: Hold greater significance than regular hadith but less than Quranic verses
- **Personal Address**: Often feature direct speech from Allah addressing humanity
- **Thematic Focus**: Primarily concern divine attributes, mercy, spiritual matters, and ethical guidance

### Relationship to Other Texts
