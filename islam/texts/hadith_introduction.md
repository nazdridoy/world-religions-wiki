# Introduction to Hadith - Preserved Teachings of the Prophet

![Ancient hadith manuscript collection](hadith_introduction_image.jpg)

Hadith literature comprises the collected reports of the statements, actions, and tacit approvals of the Prophet Muhammad, forming the second most authoritative source of Islamic teachings after the Quran. The Arabic term "hadith" literally means "report," "account," or "narrative," and in Islamic usage refers specifically to narrations about the Prophet transmitted through chains of reliable narrators. These textual collections preserve the Prophetic example (Sunnah) that Muslims strive to emulate and provide essential context for understanding Quranic guidance. The development of hadith literature involved sophisticated methods of collection, verification, and classification that evolved into a distinct scholarly discipline with its own technical vocabulary, authentication criteria, and canonical collections. This scientific approach to preserving prophetic traditions has produced an extraordinarily rich corpus of texts that continues to shape Islamic law, theology, ethics, and spiritual practice.

## Historical Development
