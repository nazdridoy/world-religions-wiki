![Ancient tafsir manuscript](classical_tafsir_image.jpg)

Classical tafsir (exegesis) represents the foundational period of systematic Quranic interpretation, spanning approximately from the 8th to the 14th centuries CE. During this formative era, Muslim scholars developed sophisticated methodologies and composed comprehensive commentaries that continue to shape Islamic thought. These works established interpretive principles, explored linguistic nuances, and addressed theological, legal, and spiritual dimensions of the Quranic text. The classical tafsir tradition reflects diverse scholarly approaches while maintaining core hermeneutical commitments, creating an intellectual legacy that remains authoritative for Muslims worldwide.
