The tradition of compiling "Forty Hadith" (Arba'un Hadithan) is a unique and cherished genre within Islamic literature, where scholars select forty (or sometimes more, but typically around this number) prophetic traditions on a specific theme or across various topics. This practice is rooted in a prophetic saying, often cited as a motivation for such compilations: "Whoever memorizes for my community forty hadith concerning its religion, Allah will raise him on the Day of Judgment among the jurists and scholars." While the authenticity of this particular hadith is debated, the tradition it inspired has yielded some of the most widely studied and beloved works in Islamic scholarship, serving as accessible guides to core Islamic teachings, ethics, and spirituality.
