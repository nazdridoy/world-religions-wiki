![Ancient manuscript of Sahih al-Bukhari](sahih_bukhari_image.jpg)

Sahih al-Bukhari, fully titled "Al-Jami' al-Sahih al-Musnad min Hadith Rasul Allah wa Sunanihi wa Ayyamihi" (The Authentic Collection of Sound Reports of the Messenger of Allah, His Practices, and His Times), stands as the most revered and authoritative compilation of hadith in Sunni Islam. Meticulously collected and authenticated by Imam Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari (810-870 CE), this monumental work contains approximately 7,563 hadith (including repetitions) selected from over 600,000 narrations the scholar examined during his sixteen-year journey across the Islamic world. Distinguished by its rigorous methodology and exacting criteria for authenticity, Sahih al-Bukhari occupies a position in Sunni Islam second only to the Quran itself in religious authority, serving as a foundational source for Islamic law, theology, ethics, and daily practice.
