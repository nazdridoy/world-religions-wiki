![Ancient manuscript of Sahih al-Bukhari](sahih_bukhari_image.jpg)

Sahih al-Bukhari is widely regarded as the most authoritative collection of hadith (reported sayings, actions, and silent approvals of the Prophet Muhammad) in Sunni Islam. Compiled by the Persian scholar Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari (810-870 CE), this monumental work represents the culmination of rigorous scholarly methods in authenticating prophetic traditions. Over a period of 16 years, al-Bukhari sifted through approximately 600,000 hadith reports, ultimately selecting only 7,563 unique narrations that met his stringent criteria for authenticity. The collection's meticulous methodology, comprehensive scope, and systematic organization have earned it an unparalleled position in Islamic scholarship and religious authority for over twelve centuries.
