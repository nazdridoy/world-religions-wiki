# Islamist Writings - Texts on Political Islam

![Book titled "Milestones" by Sayyid Qutb](islamist_writings_image.jpg)

Islamist writings constitute a diverse and influential body of literature that articulates various ideologies, theories, and programs for the application of Islamic principles in political, social, and economic life. Emerging primarily in the 20th century as a response to colonialism, Western influence, and perceived internal decline, these texts advocate for Islam as a comprehensive system (din wa dawla - religion and state) that should govern all aspects of society. While "Islamism" itself is a broad and contested term encompassing a wide spectrum of views—from peaceful political activism to revolutionary jihadism—the writings of key Islamist thinkers have profoundly shaped modern Islamic movements, political discourse in Muslim-majority countries, and global perceptions of Islam.
