![Manuscript page of Aqida Tahawiyya](aqida_tahawiyya_image.jpg)

The Aqida Tahawiyya (The Creed of al-Tahawi) stands as one of the most enduring and widely accepted statements of orthodox Sunni Islamic belief. Authored by the renowned Egyptian jurist and theologian Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi (853-933 CE/239-321 AH), this concise yet comprehensive text distills the essential doctrines of Islamic faith into 129 precisely formulated articles. Composed during a period of theological controversies and sectarian divisions, the Aqida Tahawiyya articulated core beliefs accepted across the emerging Sunni legal schools, providing a unifying creedal foundation that transcended juridical differences. Its measured positions on divine attributes, predestination, prophetic status, and eschatology established a theological middle path that has remained influential for over a millennium. Revered for its clarity, accessibility, and authoritative status, this creedal statement continues to serve as a foundational text in traditional Islamic education and a touchstone of orthodox Sunni doctrine across diverse cultural contexts.
