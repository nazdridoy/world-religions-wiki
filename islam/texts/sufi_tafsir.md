# Sufi Tafsir - Mystical Interpretation of the Quran

![Illuminated Sufi commentary manuscript](sufi_tafsir_image.jpg)

Sufi tafsir (esoteric Quranic exegesis) represents a distinctive interpretive tradition that seeks to uncover the inner, spiritual dimensions of the Quranic revelation beyond its apparent meaning. This approach emerged from the mystical currents within Islamic spirituality, where practitioners claimed that deeper layers of meaning could be accessed through spiritual purification, contemplative practice, and divine unveiling (kashf). While respecting literal interpretations, Sufi exegetes explored symbolic, allegorical, and metaphysical dimensions of the text, viewing the Quran as containing multiple levels of meaning accessible according to the spiritual capacity of the reader. This rich interpretive tradition has generated profound insights into spiritual cosmology, the soul's journey, and the nature of divine-human relationship.
