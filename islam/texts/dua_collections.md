![Ornate manuscript of a Du'a collection](dua_collections_image.jpg)

Du'a (دعاء), meaning "supplication" or "invocation," is a fundamental act of worship in Islam, representing direct communication between the believer and God. Du'a collections are compilations of these supplications, gathered from the Quran, prophetic traditions (Sunnah), and the invocations of pious individuals and spiritual masters throughout Islamic history. These collections serve as invaluable resources for Muslims seeking to express their needs, gratitude, repentance, and praise to God in structured and spiritually enriching ways. They encompass a vast range of themes, from daily prayers for protection and sustenance to specific invocations for particular occasions, reflecting the comprehensive nature of Islamic spirituality that integrates the sacred into every aspect of life.
