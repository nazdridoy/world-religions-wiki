![Shia scholar examining Quranic manuscript](shia_tafsir_image.jpg)

Shia Quranic exegesis (tafsir) represents a unique and rich interpretive tradition within Islamic scholarship, distinguished by its methodological approaches, theological foundations, and historical development. While sharing many common elements with Sunni interpretive traditions, Shia tafsir is characterized by its emphasis on the authority of the Imams from the Prophet's family (Ahl al-Bayt) as divinely guided interpreters of revelation. Through fifteen centuries of development, Shia exegetical literature has produced distinctive insights into the Quranic text while engaging with broader currents in Islamic intellectual history.
