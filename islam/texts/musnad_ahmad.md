# Musnad Ahmad - Extensive Hadith Collection Organized by Narrator

![Ancient manuscript of Musnad Ahmad](musnad_ahmad_image.jpg)

The Musnad Ahmad represents one of the most expansive and significant collections of hadith in Islamic tradition, compiled by the renowned scholar Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855 CE). Unlike the canonical "Six Books" (al-Kutub al-Sittah) that organize traditions by subject matter, this monumental work arranges approximately 28,000-30,000 hadith according to the companion who narrated them directly from the Prophet Muhammad. Distinguished by its comprehensive scope, inclusion of materials with varying degrees of authenticity, and its compiler's exacting standards of transmission, the Musnad holds a place of enduring importance in hadith scholarship. While not typically counted among the six most authoritative Sunni hadith collections, it serves as an invaluable repository of prophetic traditions that continues to inform Islamic law, theology, and spiritual practice across the Muslim world.
