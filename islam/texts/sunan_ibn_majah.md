![Manuscript page of Sunan Ibn Majah](sunan_ibn_majah_image.jpg)

*Sunan Ibn Majah* represents the sixth and final collection of the authoritative Sunni hadith compilations known as the *Kutub al-Sittah* (Six Books). Compiled by Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Yazid Ibn Majah al-Qazwini (824-887 CE/209-273 AH), this work contains over 4,000 hadith and covers a comprehensive range of religious, legal, and ethical topics. While initially considered less stringent in its authentication criteria than the other five canonical collections, Ibn Majah's work has nonetheless secured its place as an essential reference in Islamic scholarship for its preservation of unique prophetic traditions not found elsewhere.
