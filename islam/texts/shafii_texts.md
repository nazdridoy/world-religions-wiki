![Ancient manuscript of Al-Risala](shafii_texts_image.jpg)

The Shafi'i school (madhhab) represents one of the four major Sunni legal traditions, distinguished by its systematic approach to Islamic jurisprudence and its balanced methodology combining textual literalism with analogical reasoning. Founded by Imam Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i (767-820 CE), this legal school has produced a vast literature spanning foundational principles, detailed legal rulings, and scholarly commentaries across more than twelve centuries. From North Africa to Southeast Asia, Shafi'i texts have shaped religious practice, judicial systems, and educational curricula, offering a rich intellectual tradition that continues to guide millions of Muslims worldwide in their religious observances and ethical decisions.
