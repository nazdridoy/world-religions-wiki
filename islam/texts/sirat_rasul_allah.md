![Illuminated manuscript depicting the Prophet's journey](sirat_rasul_allah_image.jpg)

*Sirat Rasul Allah* (Biography of the Messenger of God) represents the earliest comprehensive account of the life of Prophet Muhammad, forming the foundation of Islamic biographical literature (sira). Originally compiled by Muhammad ibn Ishaq (d. 767 CE), this pioneering work has primarily survived through Ibn Hisham's (d. 833 CE) refined recension. Combining historical narratives, genealogical records, poetry, and accounts of military expeditions, this seminal text established the chronological framework and essential episodes of Muhammad's life that continue to shape Islamic understanding of its founding figure. Despite methodological differences from later hadith literature, the *Sirat Rasul Allah* remains an indispensable source for understanding both the historical development of early Islam and the evolving portrait of its Prophet.
