Tarikh al-Tabari, formally titled "Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk" (History of the Prophets and Kings), stands as one of the most comprehensive and authoritative historical chronicles in Islamic literature. Authored by Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (839-923 CE), the same scholar renowned for his Quranic commentary, this monumental work spans from creation to al-Tabari's own lifetime, documenting biblical history, pre-Islamic Arabia, the life of Prophet Muhammad, and the subsequent Islamic caliphates. Distinguished by its meticulous methodology of citing chains of transmission for historical reports, Tarikh al-Tabari established standards for Islamic historiography and remains an indispensable primary source for understanding early Islamic history and the development of historical writing in Islamic civilization.
