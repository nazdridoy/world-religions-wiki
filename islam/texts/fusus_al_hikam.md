![Manuscript page from Fusus al-Hikam](fusus_al_hikam_image.jpg)

*Fusus al-Hikam* (The Bezels of Wisdom) stands as the crowning masterpiece of Ibn Arabi (1165-1240 CE), widely regarded as the most influential and profound metaphysical work in Islamic mysticism. Composed toward the end of the author's life, this extraordinary text claims divine inspiration, with Ibn Arabi stating that the Prophet Muhammad himself appeared to him in a dream and handed him this book. Structured as a series of twenty-seven chapters, each dedicated to a prophet representing a particular "bezel" or facet of divine wisdom, the work presents a comprehensive metaphysical system exploring the relationship between God, humanity, and creation. Its extraordinarily dense symbolism, philosophical complexity, and mystical insights have generated centuries of commentary and continue to challenge and inspire spiritual seekers and scholars across traditions.
