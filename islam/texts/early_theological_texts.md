# Early Theological Texts - Formative Works in Islamic Theology

![Ancient manuscript of an early theological work](early_theological_texts_image.jpg)

Early Islamic theological texts represent the formative literary output of the nascent Muslim community's intellectual engagement with fundamental questions of faith, divine nature, human free will, and the relationship between revelation and reason. Emerging in the 8th and 9th centuries CE, these works laid the groundwork for the systematic development of Kalam (dialectical theology), establishing the conceptual frameworks and methodological approaches that would shape Islamic thought for centuries to come. Written during a period of intense intellectual ferment and sectarian diversification, these foundational texts reflect the diverse responses of early Muslim scholars to internal doctrinal disputes and external philosophical challenges, providing invaluable insights into the origins of Islamic theological schools and the enduring debates within the tradition.

## Historical Context and Development

### Prophetic and Companion Era (7th Century CE)
- **Quranic Foundations**: The Quran as the primary source for theological concepts
- **Sunnah and Hadith**: Prophetic traditions providing further theological guidance
- **Early Debates**: Informal discussions among Companions on matters of divine decree (qadar) and attributes
- **Kharijite and Murji'ite Views**: Early sectarian positions on faith and action
- **Emergence of Problematic Questions**: Issues like the createdness of the Quran and divine justice
- **Emphasis on Piety**: Focus on practical piety over systematic theological speculation

### Formative Period of Kalam (8th Century CE)
- **Rise of Mu'tazilism**: First systematic theological school emphasizing reason and divine justice
- **Wasil ibn Ata** (d. 748 CE): Considered a founder of Mu'tazilite thought
- **Jahm ibn Safwan** (d. 745 CE): Early proponent of determinism and negation of divine attributes
- **Hadith Scholars' Response**: Traditionalist scholars defending revelation against rationalist excesses
- **Emergence of Theological Debates**: Formalization of discussions into distinct schools of thought
- **Translation Movement**: Exposure to Greek philosophical and theological concepts

### Classical Development (9th Century CE)
- **Consolidation of Mu'tazilism**: Works by al-Jahiz (d. 869 CE) and al-Nazzam (d. 846 CE)
- **Ahmad ibn Hanbal** (d. 855 CE): Leading figure of the traditionalist movement, rejecting speculative theology
- **Mihna (Inquisition)**: State-sponsored persecution over the createdness of the Quran
- **Emergence of Proto-Ash'arism**: Scholars seeking a middle ground between rationalism and strict traditionalism
- **Beginning of Ash'ari School**: Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 936 CE) later systematizes traditionalist positions with Kalam methodology
- **Maturidi School Formation**: Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 944 CE) develops a parallel Sunni theological school

## Key Doctrinal Debates

### Divine Attributes
- **Mu'tazilite Position**: Attributes are identical to God's essence to preserve divine unity (tawhid)
- **Traditionalist Position**: Affirmation of attributes as they appear in revelation, "without asking how" (bila kayf)
- **Ash'ari Position**: Attributes are real and eternal but distinct from essence, without anthropomorphism
- **Jahmiyya's Negation**: Extreme positions denying divine attributes altogether
- **Anthropomorphism (Tashbih)**: Debates on how to interpret anthropomorphic expressions in the Quran

### Free Will and Divine Decree (Qadar)
- **Qadariyyah**: Early group emphasizing human free will and responsibility
- **Jabriyya**: Proponents of absolute divine predetermination, denying human agency
- **Mu'tazilite View**: Humans are creators of their own actions to uphold divine justice
- **Ash'ari View**: God creates all actions, but humans "acquire" them (kasb), making them responsible
- **Maturidi View**: God creates actions, but humans have genuine choice and power to perform them

### The Createdness of the Quran
- **Mu'tazilite Position**: The Quran is created (makhluq), as it is God's speech, and God alone is eternal
- **Traditionalist Position**: The Quran is the uncreated (ghayr makhluq) word of God, an eternal attribute of His
- **Mihna**: The inquisition under Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun to enforce the Mu'tazilite position
- **Ash'ari Synthesis**: God's speech is eternal, but its audible/written manifestation is created

### Faith (Iman) and Major Sins
- **Kharijite Position**: A major sin expels a Muslim from the faith (takfir)
- **Murji'ite Position**: Faith is solely inner belief, and sins do not affect one's faith
- **Mu'tazilite Position**: Sinner is in an "intermediate position" (manzila bayna manzilatayn)
- **Traditionalist/Ash'ari Position**: Faith is belief, confession, and deeds; major sins do not expel one from Islam

## Major Early Texts and Figures

### Mu'tazilite Works (mostly preserved through refutations)
- **Al-Jahiz** (d. 869 CE): Known for his eloquent prose and theological treatises (e.g., *Kitab al-Hayawan* contains theological discussions)
- **Abd al-Jabbar** (d. 1025 CE): Later Mu'tazilite, his *Al-Mughni* is a major source for Mu'tazilite doctrines

### Traditionalist Works
- **Al-Rad 'ala al-Jahmiyya wa al-Zanadiqa** by Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855 CE) - a refutation of extreme rationalists
- **Fiqh Akbar** (attributed to Abu Hanifa, d. 767 CE) - an early creedal statement
- **Aqida Tahawiyya** by Abu Ja'far al-Tahawi (d. 933 CE) - a widely accepted Sunni creedal text
- **Al-Sunnah** by Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 903 CE) - a collection of traditionalist positions

### Emerging Ash'ari and Maturidi Thought
- **Maqalat al-Islamiyyin wa Ikhtilaf al-Musallin** by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 936 CE) - documents early theological positions
- **Kitab al-Tawhid** by Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 944 CE) - foundational text of Maturidi theology
