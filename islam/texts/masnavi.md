# Masnavi - The Spiritual Couplets of Rumi

![Illuminated manuscript page of the Masnavi](masnavi_image.jpg)

The *Masnavi-ye Ma'navi* (Spiritual Couplets), commonly known simply as the *Masnavi*, stands as one of the most influential and profound works in Islamic mystical literature. Composed by the 13th-century Persian poet, jurist, and Sufi master Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi (1207-1273 CE), this monumental six-volume poem of approximately 25,000 rhythmic couplets represents the pinnacle of Sufi didactic literature. Often referred to as "the Quran in Persian," the *Masnavi* weaves together stories, parables, Quranic interpretations, and theological discussions to guide the seeker along the path to spiritual realization and divine union.
