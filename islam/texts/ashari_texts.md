![Manuscript page of an Ash'ari theological treatise](ashari_texts_image.jpg)

Ash'ari theology (Ash'ariyya) represents one of the most influential and widely adopted schools of Sunni Islamic thought, founded by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 936 CE). Emerging from a period of intense theological debate, particularly with the Mu'tazilites, Ash'arism sought to defend orthodox Islamic beliefs using rational argumentation while maintaining the supremacy of revelation. Ash'ari texts encompass a vast corpus of works that systematically address core theological questions concerning the nature of God, divine attributes, human free will, the createdness of the Quran, prophethood, and eschatology. These writings have profoundly shaped Sunni Islamic creed, jurisprudence, and intellectual discourse for over a millennium, providing a robust intellectual framework for understanding and articulating foundational Islamic tenets.

## Core Doctrinal Positions

### Divine Attributes
- **Real but Incomprehensible**: God's attributes (knowledge, power, will, etc.) are real and eternal, but their "how" (kayf) is unknown
- **Difference from Essence**: Attributes are not identical to God's essence nor separate from it
- **Speech (Kalam)**: The Quran is God's uncreated speech, but its audible and written manifestations are created
- **Seeing God (Ru'yah)**: Believers will see God in the afterlife, but without modality, direction, or anthropomorphism
- **Tanzih**: Emphasis on God's transcendence and incomparability with creation

### Human Freedom and Divine Will
- **Kasb (Acquisition)**: Humans "acquire" their actions, which are created by God
- **Divine Omnipotence**: God is the sole creator of all things, including human acts
- **Human Responsibility**: Humans are responsible for their intentions and acquired actions
- **Middle Path**: Position between Mu'tazilite emphasis on absolute free will and Jabrite determinism

### Nature of the Quran
- **Uncreated Word**: The eternal, uncreated attribute of God's speech
- **Created Manifestation**: The sounds, letters, and physical book of the Quran are created
- **Distinction**: A careful distinction between the divine attribute and its created expression

### Prophethood
- **Infallibility (Ismah)**: Prophets are protected from major sins and errors in conveying revelation
- **Miracles (Mu'jizat)**: Proofs of prophethood, challenging human capacity
- **Muhammad as Seal**: Muhammad is the final prophet, completing divine guidance

### Eschatology
- **Bodily Resurrection**: Belief in physical resurrection and accountability
- **Heaven and Hell**: Literal understanding of eternal reward and punishment
- **Intercession (Shafa'a)**: Prophets and righteous individuals can intercede for believers
