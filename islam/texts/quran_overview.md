The Quran is the central religious text of Islam, believed by Muslims to be a revelation from God (Allah) to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning in 610 CE. Considered the literal word of God, the Quran serves as the primary source of Islamic law, theology, and guidance. Its linguistic beauty, literary structure, and comprehensive teachings have profoundly shaped Islamic civilization and continue to inspire and guide the lives of over 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide.
