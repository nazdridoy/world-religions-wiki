# Mutazili Texts - Works from the Rationalist Theological School

![Ancient Mutazili manuscript page](mutazili_texts_image.jpg)

The Mutazili (or Mu'tazilite) tradition represents one of the most intellectually rigorous and philosophically sophisticated schools of Islamic theology. Emerging in the 8th century CE and reaching its zenith during the Abbasid caliphate's "Golden Age," Mutazili scholars produced an extensive corpus of texts that established a rationalist approach to Islamic thought. Distinguished by their emphasis on reason ('aql) as a complementary source to revelation, commitment to divine justice, and defense of human free will, Mutazili writers engaged deeply with Greek philosophical traditions while remaining firmly rooted in Islamic principles. Though their influence diminished after the 10th century, their textual legacy continues to inspire contemporary Muslim reformists and offers valuable insights into Islam's rich intellectual history.
