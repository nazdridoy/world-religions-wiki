# Hanafi Texts - Major Works of the Hanafi School

![Manuscript of a classical Hanafi legal text](hanafi_texts_image.jpg)

The Hanafi legal tradition represents the oldest and most widely followed school (madhhab) of Islamic jurisprudence, named after its founder Imam Abu Hanifa Nu'man ibn Thabit (d. 767 CE). Distinguished by its emphasis on systematic legal reasoning, this school developed a rich textual corpus spanning more than twelve centuries of continuous scholarship. From formative works dictated by Abu Hanifa himself to contemporary legal encyclopedias, Hanafi texts have shaped Islamic law across vast regions from the Balkans to South Asia. These works are characterized by methodological rigor, pragmatic flexibility in addressing novel situations, and a distinctive layered approach to authority that accommodates social change while maintaining doctrinal coherence. The Hanafi textual tradition represents not merely a collection of legal rulings but an evolving intellectual framework for understanding divine guidance in human affairs.
