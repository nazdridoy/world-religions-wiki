![Manuscript page from Al-Kashshaf](tafsir_zamakhshari_image.jpg)

Al-Kashshaf 'an Haqa'iq al-Tanzil (The Unveiler of the Realities of Revelation), commonly known as Tafsir al-Zamakhshari, represents one of the most intellectually rigorous and linguistically sophisticated commentaries on the Quran. Authored by Abu al-Qasim Mahmud ibn Umar al-Zamakhshari (1075-1144 CE), a brilliant scholar of the Mu'tazilite school, this exegetical work stands as a monument to rational interpretation and linguistic analysis in Islamic intellectual history. Despite its author's Mu'tazilite theological orientation, the commentary's exceptional literary and grammatical insights have secured its place as an indispensable reference across sectarian divides.
