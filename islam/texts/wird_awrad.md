# Wird and Awrad - Daily Devotional Recitations in Islam

![Muslim prayer beads and devotional text](wird_awrad_image.jpg)

Wird (plural: awrad) represents a systematic tradition of regularly performed litanies, supplications, and Quranic recitations that form a cornerstone of Muslim devotional practice, particularly within Sufi spiritual paths. These structured formulas of remembrance (dhikr) are typically received through spiritual lineages and performed at specific times of day or night as a means of maintaining constant God-consciousness and spiritual discipline. From simple phrases repeated in specific quantities to elaborate compositions combining divine names, Quranic passages, and prayers upon the Prophet Muhammad, awrad traditions reflect Islam's emphasis on rhythmic devotion as a pathway to spiritual transformation and proximity to the Divine.
