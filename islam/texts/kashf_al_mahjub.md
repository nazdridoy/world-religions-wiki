# Kashf al-Mahjub - The Unveiling of the Veiled

![Manuscript page from Kashf al-Mahjub](kashf_al_mahjub_image.jpg)

Kashf al-Mahjub (The Unveiling of the Veiled) stands as the earliest comprehensive Persian treatise on Sufism, authored by the renowned 11th-century mystic Ali ibn Uthman al-Hujwiri (d. ca. 1077 CE). Composed during a crucial period in the development of Sufism, this pioneering work synthesizes theological principles, spiritual methods, and mystical concepts while evaluating various Sufi schools and personalities. Through its systematic exploration of Islamic mystical tradition, al-Hujwiri created an authoritative manual that balances theoretical knowledge with practical guidance, orthodox compliance with mystical insight, and intellectual rigor with devotional warmth. For nearly a millennium, this seminal text has served as an indispensable reference for scholars, spiritual seekers, and religious authorities, particularly in South Asian Islamic tradition where the author's shrine in Lahore remains a major pilgrimage site.
