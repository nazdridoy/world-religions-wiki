# Meccan and Medinan Revelations - Chronological Development of the Quran

![Manuscript showing Meccan and Medinan surahs](meccan_medinan_image.jpg)

The Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad over a 23-year period (610-632 CE) across two distinct phases and locations: first in Mecca (610-622 CE) and then in Medina (622-632 CE). This chronological and geographical division forms one of the most significant frameworks for understanding the development of Quranic revelation, its thematic evolution, and its historical context. The classification of surahs (chapters) and verses as either "Meccan" or "Medinan" reflects not only their place of revelation but also their distinctive literary characteristics, thematic emphases, and legal content. This framework has profoundly shaped Islamic scholarly approaches to Quranic interpretation, providing essential context for understanding the progressive unfolding of Islamic teachings.

## Historical Context

### Meccan Period (610-622 CE)
- **Early Prophetic Mission**: Initial years of Muhammad's prophethood
- **Hostile Environment**: Growing opposition from Meccan polytheists

- **Culmination**: Ended with the hijra (migration) to Medina

### Medinan Period (622-632 CE)
- **Community Establishment**: Formation of first Muslim polity
