# Quran Compilation - Collection and Preservation of Islamic Scripture

![Ancient Quranic manuscript page](quran_compilation_image.jpg)

The compilation of the Quran represents one of history's most significant feats of textual preservation, transforming divine revelation from oral transmission and scattered written records into a unified, authoritative text. Muslims believe the Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel over approximately 23 years (610-632 CE), initially preserved through memorization and partial written records. Following Muhammad's death, a systematic process of collection, verification, and standardization occurred across several phases, resulting in the establishment of an authoritative text that has remained remarkably stable for over fourteen centuries. This process of compilation combined rigorous methodological standards, community consensus, and dedicated scholarship to ensure that the Quranic text would be preserved in its authentic form for future generations, fulfilling the divine promise expressed within the Quran itself: "Indeed, it is We who sent down the message, and indeed, We will be its guardian" (15:9).
