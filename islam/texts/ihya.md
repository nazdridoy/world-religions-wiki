# Ihya Ulum al-Din - The Revival of Religious Sciences

![Manuscript page from Ihya Ulum al-Din](ihya_image.jpg)

Ihya Ulum al-Din (The Revival of the Religious Sciences) stands as one of the most influential and comprehensive works in Islamic intellectual history. Written by Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (1058-1111 CE), this monumental text represents a masterful synthesis of Islamic law, theology, philosophy, and spirituality that transformed Muslim religious thought and practice. Composed during a period of spiritual crisis and intellectual ferment, the Ihya offered a holistic vision of Islam that balanced outward religious observance with inner spiritual development, ethical refinement, and social responsibility. Across forty books organized into four quarters, al-Ghazali systematically addresses every aspect of Muslim life, providing a blueprint for spiritual revival that continues to inspire religious reform movements, Sufi orders, and individual seekers across the Islamic world more than nine centuries after its composition.
