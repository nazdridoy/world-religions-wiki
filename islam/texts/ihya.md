# Ihya Ulum al-Din - The Revival of the Religious Sciences

![Manuscript page from Ihya Ulum al-Din](ihya_image.jpg)

Ihya Ulum al-Din (The Revival of the Religious Sciences) stands as one of the most influential and comprehensive works in Islamic intellectual history. Written by the renowned theologian, jurist, and mystic Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (1058-1111 CE), this monumental text represents the culmination of his spiritual journey and intellectual synthesis. Composed after al-Ghazali's personal crisis and subsequent spiritual transformation, the Ihya seeks to revitalize Islamic religious practice by integrating legal, theological, and mystical dimensions of the faith. Structured in four quarters—Acts of Worship, Norms of Daily Life, Spiritual Destructive Matters, and Spiritual Saving Matters—the work's forty books systematically address the cultivation of both outer religious observance and inner spiritual development. For over nine centuries, the Ihya has profoundly shaped Islamic thought, inspiring generations of scholars, spiritual seekers, and ordinary believers across the Muslim world.
