Ihya Ulum al-Din (The Revival of Religious Sciences) represents one of the most influential and comprehensive works in Islamic intellectual history. Authored by the renowned theologian, jurist, and mystic Abu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali (1058-1111 CE), this masterpiece synthesizes Islamic law, theology, ethics, and Sufism into a cohesive framework for spiritual development and religious practice. Written after al-Ghazali's profound spiritual crisis and subsequent retreat from public life, the Ihya aims to revitalize what he perceived as a decline in authentic religious understanding, balancing external religious observance with inner spiritual transformation. Its monumental scope—spanning forty books organized into four quarters—addresses worship practices, social customs, spiritual vices, and the path to salvation with unprecedented depth and psychological insight. For nearly a millennium, the Ihya has shaped Islamic spirituality, ethical discourse, and religious pedagogy, earning reverence across diverse Islamic traditions as an essential guide to holistic religious life.
