# Hanbali Texts - Major Works of the Hanbali School

![Manuscript of a classical Hanbali legal text](hanbali_texts_image.jpg)

The Hanbali school (madhhab) of Islamic jurisprudence is one of the four major Sunni schools of law, founded on the teachings of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855 CE). Distinctive for its strict adherence to the Quran and Sunnah, the Hanbali madhhab emphasizes literal interpretation of sacred texts and a cautious approach to juristic reasoning (ijtihad). Its textual tradition reflects this methodology, comprising foundational works that transmit the Imam's direct opinions, comprehensive legal treatises, and later commentaries that elaborate on the school's principles. Hanbali texts have profoundly shaped legal and theological thought, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula, and continue to serve as a vital resource for understanding a conservative yet adaptable approach to Islamic law.

## Formative Period (9th-10th Centuries CE)

### Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal and His Direct Disciples
- **Al-Musnad**: Imam Ahmad's monumental collection of hadith, which serves as a primary source for Hanbali jurisprudence.
- **Kitab al-Sunnah**: Transmits Imam Ahmad's theological and creedal positions, often intertwined with legal views.
- **Masa'il (Questions)**: Collections of legal opinions and answers recorded by his students (e.g., Masa'il of Imam Ahmad by his son Abdullah, or by Abu Dawud).
- **Al-Wara'**: A work reflecting Imam Ahmad's emphasis on piety, asceticism, and scrupulousness in religious practice.

### Early Systematization
- **Mukhtasar al-Khiraqi** by Abu al-Qasim al-Khiraqi (d. 945 CE): The earliest surviving comprehensive Hanbali legal manual, summarizing Imam Ahmad's views.
- **Al-Jami' al-Kabir** by Abu Bakr al-Khallal (d. 923 CE): A vast compilation of Imam Ahmad's opinions and narrations from his students.

## Classical Development (11th-14th Centuries CE)

### Major Legal Treatises
- **Al-Mughni** by Abdullah ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (d. 1223 CE): A monumental, multi-volume comparative fiqh work that presents the Hanbali position alongside other schools, often considered the most comprehensive Hanbali legal text.
- **Al-Muharrar fi al-Fiqh** by Majd al-Din ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1254 CE): A concise yet comprehensive summary of Hanbali fiqh.
- **Al-Rawdah al-Murabba'** by Mansur al-Buhuti (d. 1641 CE): A highly influential commentary on al-Hajjawi's "Zad al-Mustaqni'," widely studied in contemporary Hanbali circles.
- **Al-Kafi** by Ibn Qudamah: A more concise legal manual preceding Al-Mughni.

### Doctrinal and Methodological Works
- **Usul al-Sunnah** by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal: A concise creedal statement foundational to Hanbali theology.
- **I'lam al-Muwaqqi'in 'an Rabb al-'Alamin** by Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (d. 1350 CE): A comprehensive work on usul al-fiqh, emphasizing the Hanbali methodology of legal derivation.
- **Al-Durar al-Saniyyah fi al-Ajwibah al-Najdiyyah**: A collection of fatwas and treatises reflecting the Hanbali school's application in Najd (modern-day Saudi Arabia).

## Mature Period (15th Century - Present)

### Later Commentaries and Scholarly Works
- **Kashshaf al-Qina' 'an Matn al-Iqna'** by Mansur al-Buhuti (d. 1641 CE): A highly detailed and authoritative commentary on al-Hajjawi's "Al-Iqna'," considered a definitive reference for later Hanbali jurists.
- **Zad al-Mustaqni' fi Ikhtisar al-Muqni'** by Sharaf al-Din al-Hajjawi (d. 1568 CE): A concise legal manual that became a foundational text for later commentaries.
- **Dalil al-Talib li Nayl al-Matalib** by Mar'i ibn Yusuf al-Karmi (d. 1624 CE): A popular and accessible Hanbali fiqh manual.

### Modern Works and Adaptations
- **Majmu' al-Fatawa** by Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328 CE): Although a classical work, its comprehensive collection of fatwas and treatises has gained renewed prominence in modern Hanbali and Salafi thought.
- **Subul al-Salam** by Muhammad ibn Ismail al-San'ani (d. 1768 CE): A commentary on Bulugh al-Maram, reflecting a hadith-oriented approach to fiqh.
- **Fatawa of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab** (d. 1792 CE): Opinions that significantly influenced the modern Salafi movement and the application of Hanbali law in Saudi Arabia.
- **Contemporary Fatwas**: Modern Hanbali scholars continue to issue fatwas addressing contemporary issues.

## Methodological Features

### Sources of Law (Usul)
- **Quran**: The primary source, interpreted literally.
- **Sunnah**: Prophetic traditions, with strong emphasis on authentic hadith, even solitary reports (ahad).
- **Fatwas of Companions**: Opinions of the Prophet's companions, prioritized over analogical reasoning if no direct text is found.
- **Consensus (Ijma')**: Limited to the consensus of the companions, or in some views, the consensus of early scholars.
- **Analogical Reasoning (Qiyas)**: Used cautiously and as a last resort, when no direct textual evidence exists.
- **Istishab (Presumption of Continuity)**: Presuming a rule remains valid until proven otherwise.
- **Dhara'i' (Means)**: Consideration of the means leading to an end, often leading to stricter rulings to prevent harm.

### Emphasis on Textual Evidence
- Hanbalis prioritize direct textual evidence (nass) from the Quran and Sunnah.
- Less reliance on rationalist approaches compared to other schools.
- Critical stance towards innovated practices (bid'ah) not supported by early Islamic tradition.

## Distinctive Doctrines

### Theology (Aqidah)
- Strong adherence to Athari (traditionalist) theology, affirming divine attributes literally "without asking how" (bila kayf).
- Emphasis on tawhid (monotheism) and rejection of theological speculation (kalam).

### Worship ('Ibadat)
- Detailed rulings on prayer, fasting, zakat, and hajj, often with a focus on strict adherence to prophetic example.
- Emphasis on voluntary acts of worship and supererogatory prayers.

### Transactions (Mu'amalat)

- Caution against contracts involving gharar (excessive uncertainty) or riba (interest).

### Family Law
- Rulings on marriage, divorce, and inheritance, often reflecting a conservative interpretation of texts.

### Criminal Law (Hudud and Ta'zir)
- Adherence to prescribed punishments (hudud) where applicable, with stringent evidentiary requirements.
- Emphasis on ta'zir (discretionary punishments) for offenses not covered by hudud.
