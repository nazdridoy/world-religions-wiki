![Classical manuscript illustration of the Prophet's biography](sirah_image.jpg)

Sirah literature encompasses the diverse corpus of biographical works dedicated to documenting the life, character, and mission of Prophet Muhammad. Developing initially as oral traditions and gradually evolving into systematic written compilations, these biographical accounts serve as essential resources for understanding Islamic origins, prophetic example, and the historical context of Quranic revelation. Beyond mere historical documentation, sirah works function as sources of spiritual inspiration, ethical guidance, and religious instruction for Muslims worldwide. The genre has continuously evolved over fourteen centuries, reflecting changing scholarly methodologies, cultural contexts, and intellectual priorities while maintaining its central focus on preserving and interpreting the legacy of Muhammad as prophet, statesman, spiritual guide, and exemplar for humanity.
