# Maturidi Texts - Works from the Maturidi Theological School

![Ancient Maturidi manuscript page](maturidi_texts_image.jpg)

The Maturidi theological tradition represents one of Sunni Islam's foremost intellectual schools, offering a distinctive approach to Islamic theology that balances rationalism with traditionalism. Founded by Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 944 CE) in Samarkand (present-day Uzbekistan), this school developed a rich textual heritage that would become particularly influential throughout Central Asia and later within the Ottoman Empire. Maturidi texts articulate a theological vision that affirms divine sovereignty while upholding human moral agency, recognizes reason as an important source of religious knowledge while maintaining the primacy of revelation, and promotes doctrinal clarity while avoiding excessive dogmatism. Despite their historical significance, Maturidi works have received less scholarly attention than those of other theological schools, though contemporary interest has grown significantly in recent decades.
