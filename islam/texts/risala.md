# Al-Risala - Foundational Text of Islamic Legal Theory

![Manuscript page from Al-Risala](risala_image.jpg)

Al-Risala ("The Epistle") represents a watershed moment in Islamic intellectual history as the first systematic treatise on the principles of Islamic jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh). Authored by Imam Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i (767-820 CE), this groundbreaking work established a coherent methodology for deriving Islamic law, reconciling revelation with reason and providing a framework that would influence legal thought across all schools of Islamic jurisprudence. By articulating a comprehensive theory of legal sources and interpretive methods, al-Shafi'i created an intellectual foundation that continues to shape Islamic legal discourse to the present day.
