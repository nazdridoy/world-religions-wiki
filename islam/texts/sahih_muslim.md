![Ancient manuscript of Sahih Muslim](sahih_muslim_image.jpg)

Sahih Muslim stands as the second most authoritative compilation of hadith in Sunni Islam, formally titled "Al-Musnad Al-Sahih Al-Mukhtasar min Al-Sunan bi-Naql Al-'Adl 'an Al-'Adl ila Rasul Allah" (The Authentic Collection Abridged from the Traditions Transmitted by Successive Reliable Authorities from the Messenger of Allah). Meticulously assembled by Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj al-Naysaburi (817-875 CE/204-261 AH), this distinguished collection contains approximately 7,500 hadith (including repetitions) selected from over 300,000 narrations examined during its compiler's extensive scholarly journey. Renowned for its rigorous authentication methodology, systematic chapter organization, and particular attention to precise wording of traditions, Sahih Muslim is distinguished by its unique approach of grouping related narrations together and its meticulous presentation of transmission paths. While ranking second to Sahih al-Bukhari in traditional Islamic scholarship, it is often considered superior in organizational clarity and textual precision, serving as an indispensable foundation for Islamic law, theology, and ethical guidance.
