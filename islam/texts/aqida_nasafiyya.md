![Manuscript page of the Nasafi Creed](aqida_nasafiyya_image.jpg)

The Aqida Nasafiyya, authored by Imam Najm al-Din Abu Hafs Umar al-Nasafi (d. 537/1142), stands as a concise yet comprehensive formulation of Islamic creed from the Maturidi theological tradition. This influential text presents the core tenets of Islamic belief in a systematic, accessible manner, addressing divine attributes, prophethood, eschatology, and other foundational matters. Renowned for its clarity and brevity, the work became a standard teaching text throughout the Islamic world, particularly in regions where Hanafi jurisprudence predominated. Its enduring significance is further evidenced by the numerous commentaries it inspired, most notably Sa'd al-Din al-Taftazani's authoritative explanation, which together with the original text formed an essential component of traditional Islamic educational curricula for centuries.
