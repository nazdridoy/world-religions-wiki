![Historical manuscript of Jami al-Tirmidhi](jami_tirmidhi_image.jpg)

Jami al-Tirmidhi, formally titled "Al-Jami' al-Mukhtasar min al-Sunan 'an Rasul Allah" (The Abridged Collection of Prophetic Traditions), stands as one of the six canonical hadith collections in Sunni Islam. Compiled by Abu Isa Muhammad ibn Isa al-Tirmidhi (824-892 CE), the work is distinguished by its methodological innovations and exhaustive documentation of scholarly disagreements regarding hadith authenticity and jurisprudential applications. Unlike other major collections, al-Tirmidhi explicitly records varying opinions on each tradition's reliability and discusses the legal positions derived from them across different schools of thought, making it an invaluable resource for both hadith scholars and jurists throughout Islamic history.
