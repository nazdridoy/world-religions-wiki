# Risala Qushayri - Systematic Exposition of Sufism

![Manuscript page of al-Risala al-Qushayriyya](risala_qushayri_image.jpg)

The Risala Qushayriyya (Qushayri's Epistle) stands as one of the most authoritative and influential texts in the history of Sufism, composed by the renowned Persian Sufi master and scholar Abu al-Qasim al-Qushayri (986-1072 CE). Written around 1045 CE, this systematic treatise presents a comprehensive overview of Sufi doctrine, practices, terminology, and biographies that successfully bridges the mystical dimensions of Islam with its orthodox theological and legal frameworks. At a time when Sufism faced suspicion from traditional religious authorities, al-Qushayri's work demonstrated that authentic spiritual practice remained firmly grounded in Quranic teachings and prophetic traditions. For nearly a millennium, the Risala has served as an indispensable reference and instructional manual for spiritual seekers across the Islamic world, offering practical guidance on the inner path while affirming the continued necessity of outward religious observance.
