The Quran presents a unique literary composition that has captivated listeners and readers for fourteen centuries through its distinctive rhetorical style, linguistic techniques, and aesthetic qualities. As a text that emerged in a culture that highly valued eloquence and poetic expression, the Quran employs sophisticated literary devices that both drew from and transcended the conventions of 7th-century Arabian literary tradition. Muslims view these literary features as evidence of the text's divine origin, pointing to its inimitable nature (i'jaz) that challenged the most accomplished poets of its time. Understanding the Quran's literary dimensions provides essential insight into how it communicates its message and why it continues to inspire profound aesthetic and emotional responses across cultures and generations.
