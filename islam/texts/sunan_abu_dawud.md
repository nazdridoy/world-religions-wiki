# Sunan Abu Dawud - Collection Focused on Legal Matters

![Ancient manuscript of Sunan Abu Dawud](sunan_abu_dawud_image.jpg)

Sunan Abu Dawud ranks as one of the six canonical hadith collections (al-kutub al-sittah) in Sunni Islam, distinguished by its comprehensive treatment of legal traditions and practical religious matters. Compiled by Abu Dawud Sulayman ibn al-Ash'ath al-Sijistani (817-889 CE), this authoritative work contains approximately 5,274 hadith organized into 43 books covering all aspects of Islamic legal practice. Unlike the more stringent collections of Bukhari and Muslim, Abu Dawud deliberately included traditions with varying degrees of authenticity, often noting weaknesses or explaining juristic applications, thereby creating an invaluable resource for the development of Islamic law. His pioneering approach balanced scholarly rigor with practical utility, making his collection especially important for jurists and legal scholars throughout Islamic history.
