# Sunan Abu Dawud - The Authoritative Legal Hadith Collection

![Ancient manuscript of Sunan Abu Dawud](sunan_abu_dawud_image.jpg)

Sunan Abu Dawud represents one of the six canonical hadith collections (Kutub al-Sittah) in Sunni Islam, compiled by the eminent scholar Abu Dawud Sulayman ibn al-Ash'ath al-Sijistani (817-889 CE/202-275 AH). Containing approximately 5,274 hadith, this distinguished compilation is particularly notable for its systematic focus on legal matters (fiqh) and practical application of prophetic traditions. While maintaining rigorous standards of authentication, Abu Dawud adopted a methodology that preserved traditions with minor weaknesses when they held significant legal utility, carefully noting such deficiencies for scholarly transparency. His methodical arrangement by legal topics, comprehensive coverage of juristic disagreements, and inclusion of his own analytical comments established Sunan Abu Dawud as an indispensable resource for Islamic legal scholars and a cornerstone text in the development of Islamic jurisprudence.
