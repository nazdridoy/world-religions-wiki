![Historical Islamic Divisions](historical_divisions.jpg)

The historical divisions within Islam represent one of the most significant aspects of Islamic religious development. These divisions emerged primarily from political disputes in the early Islamic community but evolved into distinct theological, legal, and cultural traditions over time. Understanding these historical schisms provides crucial context for appreciating the diversity of contemporary Islamic thought and practice across the globe.

## The First Division: Succession Crisis

### The Immediate Aftermath (632 CE)

- Death of Prophet Muhammad without clear succession instructions
- Meeting of prominent companions at Saqifah Bani Sa'idah
- Selection of Abu Bakr as the first caliph
- Initial resistance from some who supported Ali ibn Abi Talib
- Eventual acceptance by most of the community
- Seeds of later division planted in these events
- Differing narratives about the Prophet's intentions

### The Rashidun Caliphate (632-661 CE)

- Four "Rightly Guided Caliphs": Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali
- Growing tensions during Uthman's caliphate
- Assassination of Uthman and subsequent civil strife
- Ali's contested caliphate and challenges from Mu'awiya
- Battle of Siffin (657) and arbitration controversy
- Emergence of the Kharijite faction rejecting both Ali and Mu'awiya
- Assassination of Ali and end of the Rashidun period

## Formation of Major Branches

### Early Shi'at Ali (Partisans of Ali)
