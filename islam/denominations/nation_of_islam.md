# Nation of Islam

![Nation of Islam mosque](nation_of_islam.jpg)

The Nation of Islam (NOI) is an African American religious and political movement founded in Detroit, Michigan in 1930 by Wallace D. Fard Muhammad. While incorporating Islamic elements, the NOI developed distinctive theological positions and social teachings significantly different from mainstream Islam, focusing on the liberation and empowerment of Black Americans. Throughout its history, the organization has advocated for Black nationalism, self-sufficiency, and separation from white society, while evolving through several leadership transitions and doctrinal shifts. Despite representing a small percentage of American Muslims, the NOI has wielded disproportionate cultural and political influence through prominent figures like Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali, and Louis Farrakhan.
