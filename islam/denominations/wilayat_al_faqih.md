# Wilayat al-Faqih

![Wilayat al-Faqih](wilayat_al_faqih.jpg)

Wilayat al-Faqih (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) is a Shia political theory developed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that forms the foundation of the current Islamic Republic of Iran. The doctrine grants political and religious authority to qualified Shia jurists (faqih) during the occultation of the Twelfth Imam, enabling clerical leadership of the state. While central to Iran's political structure, the concept remains controversial among many Shia scholars and communities who hold differing views on religious authority and governance.

## Historical Development

### Conceptual Origins

- Rooted in broader Shia concepts of authority during the Greater Occultation
- Early mentions of jurists' limited authority in works of Al-Karaki (16th century)
- Development through works of Mulla Ahmad Naraqi (1771-1829)
- Traditional view limited jurists' authority to religious affairs and specific legal matters
- Gradual expansion of the concept of clerical authority in Qajar-era Iran
- Intellectual forerunners like Sheikh Fazlollah Nuri advocating Islamic governance
- Response to secularization trends in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
- Competing models of clerical engagement with politics among Shia ulama

### Khomeini's Formulation
