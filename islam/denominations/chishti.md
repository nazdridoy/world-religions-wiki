Founded in Afghanistan and brought to the Indian subcontinent in the late 12th century, the Chishti order became the dominant spiritual path across India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and beyond. Known for its inclusive approach, emphasis on love and devotion, distinctive musical traditions, and service to humanity, the Chishtiyya has shaped the religious landscape of South Asia for over eight centuries.
