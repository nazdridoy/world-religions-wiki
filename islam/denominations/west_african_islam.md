West African Islam represents a vibrant and distinctive expression of the faith that has evolved over a millennium of complex interactions between Islamic teachings and indigenous African cultures, traditions, and social structures. From the ancient trading kingdoms of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai to the contemporary nations of the Sahel and coastal regions, Islam in West Africa has developed unique characteristics while maintaining core Islamic principles. Distinguished by its Sufi orientations, scholarly traditions, syncretistic practices, and remarkable resilience in the face of historical challenges, West African Islam has made significant contributions to global Islamic civilization while addressing specific regional contexts.
