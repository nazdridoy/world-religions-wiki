# Central Asian Islam

![Historic Mosque in Central Asia](central_asian_islam.jpg)

Central Asian Islam represents a distinctive regional expression of the Islamic tradition that has evolved across the territories of modern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and adjacent regions. Shaped by its position along the ancient Silk Roads, Central Asian Islam developed unique theological approaches, institutional forms, and cultural expressions that reflected both its nomadic and settled populations. This regional Islamic tradition has been profoundly influenced by repeated historical transformations, including Soviet-era repression and post-Soviet revival, creating a complex religious landscape marked by the ongoing negotiation between traditional practices, competing reform movements, and state secularism. Contemporary Central Asian Islam continues to evolve as these societies navigate between historical identities and modern challenges.
