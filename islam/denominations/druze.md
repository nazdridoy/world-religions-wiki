# Druze

![Druze Representation](druze.jpg)

The Druze (Arabic: الدروز, al-Durūz) are a distinctive ethno-religious community originating in the Near East, primarily concentrated today in Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan. Emerging from an Islamic context in the 11th century during the Fatimid Caliphate, Druze faith incorporates elements of Ismaili Shia Islam, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, and other philosophical traditions into a unique monotheistic belief system. The community is characterized by its secretive religious practices, strong social cohesion, belief in reincarnation, and commitment to initiated protection of religious knowledge. While historically persecuted, Druze communities have developed distinctive strategies for survival, including political pragmatism, geographic concentration in mountainous regions, and maintenance of a separate religious identity while adapting to surrounding societies. With a global population of approximately 800,000-1 million adherents, the Druze represent a significant religious minority in the Levant region, where they maintain their distinctive cultural traditions and communal institutions while navigating complex political realities.
