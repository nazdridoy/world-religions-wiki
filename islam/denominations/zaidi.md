# Zaidi Shiism

![Zaidi Mosque](zaidi_mosque.jpg)

Zaidi Shiism, also known as Zaidiyyah, is one of the oldest branches of Shia Islam, founded in the 8th century CE. Named after Zayd ibn Ali, the great-grandson of Ali ibn Abi Talib, this tradition is often considered the most moderate of the Shia branches and the closest to Sunni Islam in theology and jurisprudence. Historically centered in Yemen, where it formed the basis for the Zaidi Imamate that ruled parts of the region from 897 until 1962, Zaidi Shiism continues to be practiced by approximately 35-40% of Yemen's population (around 8-10 million people). The Zaidi approach is distinguished by its emphasis on the leadership qualities of the Imam rather than divine designation, its acceptance of the legitimacy of the first two caliphs (unlike most other Shia groups), and its rationalist theological approach with similarities to Mu'tazilite thought.
