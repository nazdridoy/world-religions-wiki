# Ash'ari Theology

![Ash'ari Theology Representation](ashari_theology.jpg)

Ash'ari theology (الأشعرية, al-Ash'ariyya) is one of the most influential theological schools in Sunni Islam, founded by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (874-936 CE) as a middle path between the rationalist Mu'tazilite school and the strict literalism of traditionalists. The Ash'ari approach seeks to defend orthodox Islamic beliefs using rational argumentation while preserving the integrity of revealed texts, particularly regarding divine attributes and human actions. This theological framework became the dominant creed throughout much of the Islamic world, especially within Shafi'i and Maliki legal traditions, and remains influential in contemporary Islamic thought. Ash'ari theology represents a sophisticated attempt to reconcile reason and revelation, offering intellectual defenses of traditional Islamic beliefs while maintaining fidelity to Quranic teachings and prophetic traditions.
