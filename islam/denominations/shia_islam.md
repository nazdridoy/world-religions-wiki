# Shia Islam

![Shia Shrine](shia_shrine.jpg)

Shia Islam is the second-largest branch of Islam, constituting approximately 10-15% of the global Muslim population. The term "Shia" derives from "Shi'at Ali" (partisans of Ali), referring to followers who believe that Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad, was the rightful successor to lead the Muslim community after Muhammad's death. This foundational disagreement over early Islamic leadership developed into distinctive theological doctrines, jurisprudential methodologies, ritual practices, and historical narratives that distinguish Shia Islam from the majority Sunni tradition.
