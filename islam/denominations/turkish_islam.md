# Turkish Islam

![Turkish Mosque](turkish_mosque.jpg)

Turkish Islam represents a distinctive expression of the faith that has evolved over centuries of Ottoman rule, republican secularism, and contemporary revival. Distinguished by its synthesis of Sunni orthodoxy, Sufi spirituality, and indigenous Turkish cultural elements, it has played a pivotal role in shaping both Turkish national identity and global Islamic discourse. Turkey's unique geopolitical position bridging Europe and Asia has made its Islamic tradition particularly influential in both regions.
