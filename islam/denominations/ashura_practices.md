![Ashura Commemoration](ashura_practices.jpg)

Ashura practices encompass the diverse rituals, commemorations, and observances associated with the remembrance of Imam Husayn ibn Ali's martyrdom at the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE (61 AH). This event, occurring on the 10th day of Muharram (the first month of the Islamic calendar), represents a pivotal moment in Islamic history, particularly for Shi'a Muslims. The commemoration of Ashura has evolved over centuries into a complex set of practices that vary significantly across regions, cultures, and denominational lines, serving as both religious ritual and cultural expression. These practices play a crucial role in preserving collective memory, reinforcing community identity, and transmitting religious values across generations.
