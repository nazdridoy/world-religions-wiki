# Madhabs (Islamic Legal Schools)

![Madhabs Representation](madhabs.jpg)

Madhabs (المذاهب, al-Madhāhib, singular: مذهب, madhhab) are the schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) that have evolved over Islamic history to provide systematic frameworks for interpreting and applying Islamic law (sharia) derived from the Quran and Sunnah. These legal schools represent diverse methodological approaches to understanding religious texts and deriving practical guidance for all aspects of Muslim life. While unified in their recognition of foundational Islamic sources, each madhab developed distinctive principles of legal theory (usul al-fiqh) and methodology that led to variations in specific rulings (furu). Today, the four major Sunni madhabs—Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali—along with the Ja'fari school in Shia Islam, continue to shape religious practice and legal systems across the Muslim world, offering a rich tradition of legal thought that balances fidelity to religious texts with pragmatic responses to changing social conditions.
