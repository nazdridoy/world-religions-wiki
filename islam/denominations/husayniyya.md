# Husayniyya

![Husayniyya](husayniyya.jpg)

A husayniyya is a congregational hall or religious complex specially dedicated to Shia Islamic commemorations, particularly those associated with the martyrdom of Imam Husayn ibn Ali at Karbala. These institutions serve as crucial centers for Shia religious, cultural, and social life, primarily in Twelver Shia communities across Iran, Iraq, the Persian Gulf states, Lebanon, Pakistan, India, and wherever significant Shia populations exist. More than mere buildings, husayniyyas represent the physical embodiment of Shia collective memory and the centrality of the Karbala narrative to Shia identity.
