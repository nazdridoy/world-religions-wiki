# Muslim Brotherhood

![Muslim Brotherhood Rally](muslim_brotherhood_rally.jpg)

The Muslim Brotherhood (al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun) is one of the most influential and controversial Islamist movements in modern history. Founded in Egypt in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna, the organization has evolved from a local religious social organization into a transnational movement with branches and affiliated groups across the Muslim world and beyond. With its distinctive ideology combining Islamic revival, anti-colonialism, social welfare, and political activism, the Brotherhood has significantly shaped contemporary Islamic political thought and activism. Though its status varies dramatically across different countries—from political party to banned terrorist organization—its influence on modern Islamic movements is undeniable.
