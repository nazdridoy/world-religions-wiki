![Western Mosque](western_mosque.jpg)

Western Muslims constitute a diverse and growing population of adherents to Islam living in Europe, North America, Australia, and other Western societies. Originating through various waves of immigration, conversion, and natural population growth, Muslims in Western countries represent a broad spectrum of Islamic traditions, ethnic backgrounds, and approaches to balancing religious identity with life in predominantly secular, non-Muslim societies. Estimated at 25-30 million in Europe and 3.5-4.5 million in the United States, these communities have established distinctive institutions and practices while navigating unique challenges related to integration, religious freedom, cultural adaptation, and identity formation in pluralistic contexts. The emergence of Western Muslim thought and practice represents a significant development in contemporary Islam, generating new theological approaches, cultural expressions, and models for religious life in modern, diverse societies.
