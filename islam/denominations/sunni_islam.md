# Sunni Islam

![Sunni Islam Mosque](sunni_mosque.jpg)

Sunni Islam is the largest branch of Islam, comprising approximately 85-90% of the world's Muslim population. The name "Sunni" derives from "Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jama'ah" (People of the Sunnah and the Community), reflecting their emphasis on following the traditions (Sunnah) of the Prophet Muhammad and the consensus of the Muslim community. Sunni Muslims recognize the legitimacy of the first four caliphs who succeeded Muhammad as leaders of the Muslim community, distinguishing them from Shia Muslims who believe leadership should have passed to Ali ibn Abi Talib, the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law.
