# Naqshbandi Order

![Naqshbandi Sufi Gathering](naqshbandi_gathering.jpg)

The Naqshbandi Order (Tariqah Naqshbandiyyah) is one of the major Sufi orders (tariqas) of Islam, distinguished by its emphasis on silent dhikr (remembrance of God), strict adherence to Shari'a, and its historical influence in political, social, and religious spheres across the Muslim world. With a lineage traced to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, the first caliph of Islam, rather than through Ali ibn Abi Talib as most other orders do, the Naqshbandi order has maintained a distinctive orthodox orientation while developing sophisticated spiritual methodologies. The order's influence extends from Central Asia and the Indian Subcontinent to the Ottoman territories, China, Southeast Asia, and more recently, Western countries.
