# Alawites

![Alawite Representation](alawites.jpg)

The Alawites (Arabic: علويون, ʿAlawīyūn), also known as Alawi Shias or Nusayris, are a syncretic religious group historically centered in Syria, particularly in the country's coastal and mountainous regions. Emerging as an offshoot of Twelver Shiism in the 9th-10th centuries CE, Alawite belief combines elements of Shia Islam with Gnostic, neo-Platonic, and pre-Islamic religious influences. The community has historically maintained secretive religious practices due to centuries of persecution, revealing full doctrinal teachings only to initiated members. Despite representing a minority within Islam and Syria (approximately 10-15% of Syria's population), Alawites have held disproportionate political power in modern Syria since the 1963 Ba'athist coup, most notably through the Assad family's rule since 1971. Their complex theology, distinctive practices, and political prominence have made Alawites a subject of both scholarly interest and sectarian controversy within the broader Islamic world.
