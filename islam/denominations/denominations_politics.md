The relationship between Islamic denominations and politics represents a complex and multifaceted dimension of both historical and contemporary Muslim societies. While Islam has never maintained a strict separation between religious and political spheres, the specific ways in which different Islamic denominations conceptualize, engage with, and influence politics vary considerably. These variations reflect theological differences, historical experiences, and cultural contexts, creating diverse approaches to governance, authority, and civic participation across the Muslim world.
