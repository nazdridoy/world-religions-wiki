# Traditional Islam

![Traditional Islam](traditional_islam.jpg)

Traditional Islam refers to approaches to Islamic practice and interpretation that emphasize continuity with historical methodologies, institutions, and scholarly traditions. Distinguished from both modernist reformism and fundamentalist revivalism, traditional Islam values established schools of jurisprudence, classical scholarship, and traditional chains of transmission. This orientation encompasses diverse expressions across different geographic, cultural, and doctrinal contexts while sharing a commitment to maintaining methodological continuity with the past. In recent decades, traditional Islam has experienced a renaissance as a conscious alternative to both rigid literalism and liberal reinterpretation.
