# Islamic Divisions

![Islamic Divisions](islamic_divisions.jpg)

Islam, which began as a unified religious community under the leadership of Prophet Muhammad, has developed diverse expressions through fourteen centuries of history. This diversity manifests in various theological, legal, political, and cultural dimensions, resulting in distinct branches, schools of thought, and movements. While all Muslims share core beliefs and practices—such as monotheism, the prophethood of Muhammad, the authority of the Quran, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage—interpretive differences on key theological questions and historical events have led to the formation of different traditions within the faith.

## Historical Development of Major Divisions
