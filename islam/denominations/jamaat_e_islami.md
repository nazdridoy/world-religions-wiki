# Jamaat-e-Islami

![Jamaat-e-Islami Logo or Gathering](jamaat_e_islami.jpg)

Jamaat-e-Islami (JI, "Islamic Party") is a prominent Islamist movement founded in British India in 1941 by the influential Islamic theologian and philosopher Abul Ala Maududi. The organization advocates for the establishment of an Islamic state governed by Sharia law, believing in the comprehensive nature of Islam as a complete system for social, political, and individual life. Following the partition of India, Jamaat-e-Islami split into separate organizations in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan), and Kashmir, each developing distinct characteristics while maintaining ideological connections. The movement has been influential in shaping Islamic political thought and activism across South Asia and beyond, operating through political parties, student wings, charity organizations, and educational institutions.
