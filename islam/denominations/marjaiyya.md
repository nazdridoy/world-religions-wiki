# Marjaiyya

![Grand Ayatollah in Najaf](marjaiyya_najaf.jpg)

Marjaiyya (Arabic: مرجعية, meaning "source of emulation") is the institutional framework of religious authority in Twelver Shia Islam, centered on senior clerics known as maraji' (singular: marja') who serve as sources of emulation for lay Shia Muslims in matters of religious practice and legal rulings. Developed over centuries as a response to the occultation of the Twelfth Imam, this system provides spiritual and jurisprudential leadership through scholars who have achieved the highest level of religious learning. The marjaiyya represents a distinctive approach to religious authority that balances centralized guidance with decentralized administration, creating a clerical hierarchy that has profoundly shaped Shia religious, social, and political life.
