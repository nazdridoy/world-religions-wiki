Balkan Islam refers to the Islamic traditions and communities found in Southeast Europe, particularly in countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, and parts of Bulgaria, Serbia, and Montenegro.

- 19th-20th centuries: decline of Ottoman power, emergence of national states, and shifting Muslim identities
- Wars, population exchanges, and migration affected Muslim communities

## Beliefs and Practices

- Predominantly Sunni Islam (Hanafi school), with some Bektashi and other Sufi influences
- Mosques and tekkes (Sufi lodges) as community centers
- Observance of Islamic festivals, circumcision, and local customs
- Distinctive Balkan Islamic art, music, and architecture
- Interactions with Christian and Jewish communities

## Community and Organization

- Religious education, charitable organizations, and cultural associations
- Diaspora communities in Western Europe and North America
