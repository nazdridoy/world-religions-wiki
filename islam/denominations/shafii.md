# Shafi'i School

![Shafi'i School Representation](shafii.jpg)

The Shafi'i School (المذهب الشافعي, al-Madhhab al-Shāfi'ī) is one of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) within Sunni Islam, founded by Imam Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i (767-820 CE). Emerging as a balanced middle way between the traditionalist approach of the Maliki school and the rationalist methodology of the Hanafi school, the Shafi'i madhab is distinguished by its systematic legal theory, comprehensive classification of legal sources, and methodical approach to textual interpretation. Imam al-Shafi'i's groundbreaking work in usul al-fiqh (principles of jurisprudence) established a coherent framework for derivation of Islamic law that continues to influence Islamic legal thought across all traditions. Today, the Shafi'i school has a widespread global presence, particularly in Southeast Asia, East Africa, and parts of the Middle East, and remains an influential force in Islamic scholarship and practice.
