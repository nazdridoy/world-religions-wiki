The Mevlevi Order is a prominent Sufi tariqah (order) founded in the 13th century by the followers of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, the renowned Persian poet, Islamic scholar, and mystic. Distinguished by its famous sema ceremony featuring the iconic "whirling dervishes," the Mevlevi Order has become one of the most recognizable expressions of Sufi spirituality worldwide. With its rich cultural, artistic, and intellectual heritage, the order has made significant contributions to Islamic mysticism, poetry, music, and philosophy, while maintaining a tradition that emphasizes spiritual refinement through love, tolerance, and aesthetic beauty.
