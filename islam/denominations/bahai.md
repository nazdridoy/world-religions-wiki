The Baha'i Faith is a world religion that emerged from 19th-century Persia (Iran), rooted in Islamic tradition but developing a distinct identity and global following. Founded by Baha'u'llah, the Baha'i Faith teaches the unity of all religions, the oneness of humanity, and progressive revelation. While not considered a branch of Islam, it is included here due to its origins and continued connections to the Muslim world.
