Sectarian relations in Islam encompass the complex historical and contemporary interactions between the various branches, schools, and movements within the Islamic tradition. While Muslims share fundamental beliefs and practices, differences in theological interpretation, historical narratives, and jurisprudence have created distinct communities with varying relationships to one another.
