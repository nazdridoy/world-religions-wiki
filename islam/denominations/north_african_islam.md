# North African Islam

![Mosque in North Africa](north_african_islam.jpg)

North African Islam represents a distinctive regional expression of the Islamic tradition that has evolved across the Maghreb region (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and sometimes including Mauritania and parts of Egypt). Shaped by its Berber indigenous foundations, Arab conquests, Mediterranean influences, and colonial experiences, North African Islam exhibits unique cultural expressions, ritual practices, and institutional forms. While firmly rooted in Sunni orthodoxy, particularly the Maliki legal school, it incorporates significant Sufi dimensions and local cultural elements that distinguish it from other regional expressions of Islam. Its history of negotiating between tradition and modernity, colonialism and independence, and secularism and religious revival makes it a complex and evolving religious landscape within the broader Muslim world.
