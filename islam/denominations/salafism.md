# Salafism

![Salafi Mosque](salafi_mosque.jpg)

Salafism is an ultraconservative reform movement within Sunni Islam that advocates a return to the traditions of the "righteous predecessors" (al-salaf al-ṣāliḥ) - the early generations of Muslims including the Prophet Muhammad, his companions (Sahabah), their successors (Tabi'un), and the followers of the successors (Tabi' al-Tabi'in). Emerging in the late 19th century but with intellectual roots in earlier revivalist movements, Salafism emphasizes strict monotheism (tawhid), rejection of religious innovations (bid'ah), and direct engagement with foundational Islamic texts rather than later scholarly interpretations. Today, Salafism exists in diverse forms across the Muslim world, ranging from quietist pietism to political activism and, in its most extreme manifestations, militant jihadism.
