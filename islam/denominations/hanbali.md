# Hanbali School

![Hanbali Mosque](hanbali_mosque.jpg)

The Hanbali School (مذهب حنبلي, Madhhab Ḥanbalī) is one of the four major schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh). Founded by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855 CE), it is characterized by its strict adherence to the Quran and Sunnah, its literal approach to religious texts, and its minimalist use of interpretive methods like analogical reasoning (qiyas). Today, the Hanbali madhab is the official school of law in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and has significantly influenced modern Salafi and Wahhabi movements with its emphasis on textual literalism and rejection of religious innovations.

## Historical Development
