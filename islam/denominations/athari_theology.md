# Athari Theology

![Athari Theology Representation](athari_mosque.jpg)

Athari theology (الأثري, al-Atharī), also known as the traditionalist or textualist school, is one of the main theological approaches within Sunni Islam. Derived from the Arabic word "athar" (tradition or narration), this theological orientation emphasizes strict adherence to the literal meanings of the Quran and Hadith without engaging in speculative interpretation, particularly regarding the divine attributes of Allah. Eschewing complex philosophical frameworks, Athari theology adopts the approach of the early Muslim generations (salaf), accepting religious texts at face value while maintaining "bila kayf" (without asking how) toward matters beyond human comprehension. Historically associated with scholars like Ahmad ibn Hanbal and later revived by Ibn Taymiyyah, Athari theology today forms the doctrinal foundation of Salafi movements and is the official theological position in Saudi Arabia.
