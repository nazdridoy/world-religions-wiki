# Qadiriyya Order

![Qadiriyya Sufi Ceremony](qadiriyya_ceremony.jpg)

The Qadiriyya is one of the oldest and most widespread Sufi orders (tariqas) in the Islamic world, founded by Abdul-Qadir Gilani (1077-1166 CE), a respected Hanbali jurist and theologian from Gilan, Iran who taught in Baghdad. Distinguished by its relatively inclusive doctrine, emphasis on charitable works, accessibility to ordinary believers, and adaptability to local cultures, the Qadiriyya has played a significant role in the spread of Islam, particularly in Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Its accommodating approach has allowed it to flourish in diverse cultural contexts while maintaining core spiritual principles founded on orthodox Sunni beliefs.
