# Ahmadiyya Movement

![Ahmadiyya Representation](ahmadiyya.jpg)

The Ahmadiyya Movement (الجماعة الإسلامية الأحمدية, al-Jamāʿah al-Islāmīyah al-Aḥmadīyah) is a religious organization founded in 1889 in Qadian, India by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), who claimed to be the divinely appointed Mujaddid (reformer), the promised Messiah and Mahdi awaited by Muslims. The movement has drawn controversy within mainstream Islam primarily due to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's claims and interpretations of certain Islamic doctrines, particularly regarding the finality of Muhammad's prophethood. The Ahmadiyya community has evolved into a global organization known for its emphasis on peaceful propagation of Islam, interfaith dialogue, and humanitarian efforts. With followers in over 200 countries, its administrative headquarters are now based in London, while retaining spiritual centers in Qadian, India and Rabwah, Pakistan. Despite facing significant persecution and legal restrictions in various countries, the community continues to grow and maintain its distinctive theological positions and missionary activities.
