# Zahiri School

![Zahiri School Representation](zahiri_mosque.jpg)

The Zahiri School (المذهب الظاهري, al-Madhhab al-Ẓāhirī) is a distinct approach to Islamic jurisprudence that emerged in the 9th century CE, characterized by its strict adherence to the apparent (ẓāhir) meaning of the Quran and hadith while rejecting analogical reasoning (qiyas), juristic preference (istihsan), and other interpretive methods employed by other legal schools. Founded by Dawud al-Zahiri (815-884 CE) in Baghdad, this school sought to establish law exclusively from the literal text of scripture and consensus of the early Muslim community. Though it flourished for several centuries, particularly in al-Andalus (Muslim Spain) where it found its most eloquent defender in Ibn Hazm (994-1064 CE), the Zahiri approach eventually declined in influence. Today, while it no longer exists as a formal school with practicing adherents, its literalist methodology continues to influence aspects of contemporary Islamic legal thought, particularly among those who emphasize textual authority over human reasoning.

## Historical Development

### Foundation and Early Period (9th-10th centuries)

- Founded by Abu Sulayman Dawud ibn Khalaf al-Zahiri (815-884 CE) in Baghdad
- Emerged as a reaction against perceived subjective reasoning in Hanafi jurisprudence
- Developed during the formative period of Islamic legal theory (usul al-fiqh)
- Initial spread among scholarly circles in Iraq and Iran
- Early followers included Muhammad ibn Dawud al-Zahiri (the founder's son)
- Positioned between traditionalist Hanbali and rationalist Hanafi approaches
- Challenged established methodologies of juristic analogy
- Emphasized direct derivation from textual sources without intermediary principles

### Classical Period and Andalusian Florescence (11th-12th centuries)

- Major development in al-Andalus (Muslim Spain) through Ibn Hazm (994-1064)
- Ibn Hazm's "Al-Muhalla" representing the most comprehensive Zahiri legal compendium

### Decline and Legacy (13th-20th centuries)

## Core Principles and Methodology

### Textual Primacy

- Exclusive reliance on the apparent (zahir) meaning of the Quran and Sunnah
- Rejection of esoteric or allegorical interpretations unless explicitly indicated in texts
- Words understood according to their conventional linguistic meaning
- Literal interpretation unless context clearly indicates otherwise
- Emphasis on Arabic linguistic analysis to determine textual meanings
- Restriction of legitimate interpretation to what the text can bear linguistically
- Rejection of speculative or philosophically influenced readings
- Strong distinction between clear textual evidence and human conjecture

### Rejection of Analogical Reasoning

- Fundamental opposition to qiyas (analogical reasoning) as a source of law
- View that qiyas introduces human subjectivity into divine law
- Belief that scripture is comprehensive and addresses all necessary matters
- Argument that qiyas often leads to contradictory results based on jurist preferences
- Acceptance of causal reasoning (ta'lil) within texts but not beyond them
- Rejection of extended legal causation beyond explicitly mentioned rationales
- Criticism of other schools for using analogy to override or modify explicit texts
- Position that divine law cannot be known through human rational inference

### Sources of Law

- Quran: Primary source with apparent meanings given priority
- Authentic Sunnah: Equal in authority to the Quran for legal rulings
- Consensus (ijma): Limited to consensus of Companions on issues not in texts
- Istishab: Presumption of continuity of previous rulings until evidence of change
- Rejection of juristic preference (istihsan) as subjective innovation
- Rejection of considerations of public interest (maslaha) as independent source
- Rejection of custom ('urf) as legally binding without textual basis
- Recognition of necessity (darura) only when explicitly indicated in texts

### Approach to Contradiction

- Presumption that authentic texts cannot fundamentally contradict each other
- Sophisticated tools for reconciling apparently contradictory texts
- Principle of specification (takhsis) of general statements by specific ones
- Recognition of abrogation (naskh) when chronologically established
- Careful analysis of the chain of transmission (isnad) to assess authenticity
- Preference for interpretations that maintain validity of all texts
- Rejection of subjective preferences in resolving apparent contradictions
- Emphasis on comprehensive textual analysis before declaring contradiction

### Legal Theory

- Sharp distinction between legislative (insha'i) and descriptive (khabari) texts
- Categorical rejection of "spirit of the law" apart from its literal stipulations
- Position that legal obligations apply only after clear textual evidence
- Presumption of non-obligation (bara'a al-dhimma) absent explicit texts
- Rejection of expanded application of legal causes ('ilal) beyond texts
- Limited scope for interpretive judgment (ijtihad) within textual parameters
