# Tariqas (Sufi Orders)

![Tariqas](tariqas.jpg)

Tariqas, or Sufi orders, are organized brotherhoods within Islamic mysticism that provide structured spiritual paths for seekers under the guidance of master teachers (shaykhs). These orders developed systematic methods of spiritual training, distinctive litanies, and initiatic chains connecting disciples to the Prophet Muhammad. While sharing core devotional aims, each tariqa has evolved distinctive practices, geographical distributions, and philosophical orientations. With hundreds of orders and sub-branches worldwide, tariqas have profoundly influenced Islamic spiritual life, cultural expressions, and social organization across diverse Muslim societies for nearly a millennium.
