The Kharijites (Arabic: الخوارج, al-Khawārij, "those who went out") represent the earliest major theological and political schism in Islamic history, emerging during the first civil war (fitna) in the 7th century CE. While many early Kharijite groups were characterized by their radical positions and eventually disappeared, one moderate branch—the Ibadi movement—survives to this day, forming the third major denomination of Islam alongside Sunni and Shia traditions. This article explores the historical development of the Kharijite movement, its key theological positions, various sub-groups, and the contemporary Ibadi community that represents its moderate surviving legacy.

## Historical Origins and Development

### The First Fitna and Emergence (656-661 CE)

- Originated during the caliphate of Ali ibn Abi Talib (656-661 CE)
- Emerged from dispute between Ali and Muawiyah following the killing of Uthman
- Initially supporters of Ali against Muawiyah's rebellion
- Battle of Siffin (657 CE) as critical turning point
- Ali's acceptance of arbitration (tahkim) with Muawiyah seen as compromise with divine law
- Withdrawal of puritanical elements from Ali's army with slogan "judgment belongs to God alone"
- Name "Khawarij" derived from their "going out" or secession from Ali's forces
- Formation of separate community at Harura near Kufa
- Initial leadership under Abdullah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi
- Massacre of non-supporters at Nahrawan by Ali's forces (658 CE)

### Early Expansion and Rebellions (661-750 CE)

- Assassination of Ali in 661 CE by Abd al-Rahman ibn Muljam, a Kharijite seeking revenge
- Growth during Umayyad period as anti-establishment movement
- Appeal to disenfranchised groups, especially non-Arab converts and tribal Arabs
- Major uprising under Nafi ibn al-Azraq in southern Iraq (685 CE)
- Formation of radical Azraqite faction rejecting association with non-Kharijites
- Multiple rebellions across Iraq, Iran, and Arabian Peninsula
- Development of more moderate factions: Najdat, Sufriyya, and Ibadiyya
- Temporary control of regions in southern Iraq, parts of Iran, and Yemen
- Gradual military defeat of most radical factions by late Umayyad period
- Survival of moderate Ibadi community through greater flexibility and secrecy

### Later Developments and Transformations (750-Present)

- Most radical Kharijite groups eliminated by early Abbasid period

- Establishment of early Ibadi imamates in North Africa, Oman, and Yemen
- First Ibadi imamate in Oman established by Julanda ibn Masud (750-751 CE)
- Rustamid dynasty founding Ibadi state in North Africa (776-909 CE)
- Periodic reemergence of Ibadi political authority in Oman throughout history
- Ibadi communities surviving in North Africa under various political authorities
- Preservation of distinct Ibadi legal and theological tradition through scholarship
- Modern Ibadi state in Oman since 1920 with Sultan Qaboos modernizing while preserving tradition
- Contemporary Ibadi communities in Oman, Zanzibar, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria
