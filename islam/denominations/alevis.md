Alevism is a distinct religious tradition found primarily in Turkey, blending elements of Shia Islam, Sufism, and local Anatolian beliefs. Alevis have a unique theology, ritual life, and social structure, and have often faced marginalization within the broader Muslim world. While sometimes grouped with Shia Islam, Alevism is recognized for its independent development and rich cultural heritage.
