# Saints and Shrines

![Sufi shrine with devotees](islamic_shrine.jpg)

The veneration of saints (awliya) and their shrines constitutes a significant dimension of lived Islam across many regions and traditions, particularly within Sufism. This practice centers around the belief that certain individuals achieve exceptional spiritual proximity to God and may serve as intercessors or channels of divine blessing (baraka) even after death. While fundamental to popular religiosity in many Muslim societies, saint veneration has also been a source of theological controversy, with critics arguing that such practices potentially compromise Islamic monotheism.
