# Twelver Shia Islam

![Twelver Shia Mosque](twelver_mosque.jpg)

Twelver Shiism (also known as Ithna Ashari or Imamiyyah) is the largest branch of Shia Islam, constituting approximately 85% of all Shia Muslims worldwide. Its adherents are concentrated primarily in Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, and Lebanon, with significant populations in Pakistan, India, and parts of the Gulf states. The name "Twelver" refers to their belief in twelve divinely appointed Imams, beginning with Ali ibn Abi Talib and concluding with Muhammad al-Mahdi, the twelfth Imam who is believed to be in occultation since 874 CE and who will return as the Mahdi at the end of time to establish justice on earth.
