# Wahhabism

![Wahhabism Mosque](wahhabism_mosque.jpg)

Wahhabism is a puritanical Islamic revivalist movement that emerged in the Arabian Peninsula during the 18th century, founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792). Named by its opponents rather than its adherents (who prefer terms like "Salafism," "Muwahhidun," or simply "true Islam"), Wahhabism advocates a strict, literalist interpretation of Islamic texts while rejecting many traditional practices as innovations. Through its alliance with the House of Saud, this movement became the dominant religious force in Saudi Arabia and subsequently gained global influence through the kingdom's oil wealth and religious soft power. Characterized by its emphasis on absolute monotheism (tawhid), condemnation of practices deemed polytheistic (shirk), and rejection of interpretive flexibility, Wahhabism has profoundly shaped modern Islamic discourse while remaining controversial among many Muslims.
