# Maturidi Theology

![Maturidi Theology Mosque](maturidi_mosque.jpg)

Maturidi theology (الماتريدية, al-Māturīdīyah) represents one of the three major orthodox theological schools within Sunni Islam, alongside Ash'arism and Atharis. Founded by Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (853-944 CE) in Samarkand (present-day Uzbekistan), this theological framework balances between reason and revelation while affirming divine attributes and human free will within the context of divine predestination. The Maturidi school became predominantly associated with the Hanafi legal tradition and spread throughout Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and parts of the Ottoman Empire. Today, it remains the primary theological orientation for approximately half of the world's Sunni Muslims, particularly those following the Hanafi school of law, offering a middle path that accommodates both rationalist and traditionalist inclinations within Islamic orthodoxy.

## Historical Development

### Foundation and Early Development (10th-11th centuries)
