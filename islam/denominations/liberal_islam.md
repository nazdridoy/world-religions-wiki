# Liberal Islam

![Liberal Islamic scholars](liberal_islam.jpg)

Liberal Islam represents a diverse intellectual and social movement within Islam that seeks to reconcile Islamic faith with modern liberal values such as democracy, human rights, gender equality, and religious pluralism. Rather than a formal denomination with distinct institutions, Liberal Islam encompasses various thinkers, organizations, and communities who emphasize the compatibility between Islam's core ethical principles and contemporary notions of individual freedom, social justice, and civic engagement. Liberal Muslims advocate for contextual readings of Islamic texts, distinguishing between eternal ethical principles and historically contingent legal rulings, while affirming Islam's capacity for continuous intellectual and spiritual renewal. The movement gained prominence in the late 20th century and continues to influence religious discourse worldwide, particularly among educated urban Muslims negotiating the challenges of modernity.
