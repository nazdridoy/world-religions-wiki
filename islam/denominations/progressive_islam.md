# Progressive Islam

![Progressive Muslim gathering](progressive_islam.jpg)

Progressive Islam is a contemporary approach to Islamic thought and practice that seeks to reinterpret Islamic traditions in light of modern values such as human rights, gender equality, social justice, and pluralism. Rather than a formal denomination or organized movement, it represents a diverse intellectual and social trend that emerged prominently in the late 20th century. Progressive Muslims aim to address contemporary challenges by engaging critically with traditional Islamic texts while emphasizing Islam's ethical principles and adaptability to changing contexts. This approach has gained influence among Muslim academics, activists, and communities, particularly in Western countries and among younger, educated Muslims globally.
