# Neo-Traditionalism

![Neo-Traditional Islamic Scholar](neo_traditionalism.jpg)

Islamic Neo-Traditionalism represents a contemporary movement that seeks to revive and reimagine traditional Islamic scholarship while engaging with modernity on its own terms. Distinguished from both modernist reformers and conservative literalists, Neo-Traditionalists emphasize a return to classical Islamic intellectual traditions, particularly those of legal schools (madhahib), Sufism, and scholastic theology (kalam), while acknowledging the realities of contemporary contexts. The movement advocates for maintaining continuity with historical Islamic scholarship, upholding spiritual dimensions of the faith, and preserving traditional chains of knowledge transmission, while selectively engaging with modern challenges through established interpretative methodologies. Prominent among educated urban Muslims in both Western and Muslim-majority countries, Neo-Traditionalism appeals to those seeking authentic religious grounding without rejecting modern life entirely.
