# Neo-Sufism

![Neo-Sufi Gathering](neo_sufism.jpg)

Neo-Sufism refers to modern adaptations and reformulations of traditional Sufi practices, teachings, and organizational structures that emerged primarily in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Distinguished from both traditional Sufi orders (tariqas) and purely secular mindfulness movements, Neo-Sufism represents attempts to make Sufi spirituality accessible to contemporary audiences while addressing modern concerns. These movements often emphasize universal spiritual principles, psychological well-being, and ethical development while downplaying supernatural elements, strict hierarchies, and cultural specificities that characterized traditional Sufism. Neo-Sufi approaches range from secularized adaptations focused on meditation techniques to more religiously grounded movements seeking to revive Sufi spirituality within orthodox Islamic frameworks, appealing to urban, educated Muslims and spiritual seekers across various cultural contexts.
