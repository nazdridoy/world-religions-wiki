Authority structures in Islam encompass the diverse systems, institutions, and principles through which religious guidance, interpretation, and leadership are established and maintained across different Islamic traditions. While all Muslims recognize the ultimate authority of Allah and the foundational texts of the Quran and Sunnah, significant variations exist in how religious authority is constituted, transmitted, and exercised. These differences reflect historical developments, theological positions, and cultural contexts, creating distinct patterns of religious leadership and community organization across the Islamic world.
