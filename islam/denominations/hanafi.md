# Hanafi School

![Hanafi School Representation](hanafi.jpg)

The Hanafi School (المذهب الحنفي, al-Madhhab al-Ḥanafī) is the oldest of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) within Sunni Islam, founded by Imam Abu Hanifa al-Nu'man (699-767 CE) in Kufa, Iraq. Renowned for its emphasis on rational legal reasoning, systematic approach to jurisprudence, and accommodation of local customs, the Hanafi madhab developed a comprehensive methodology that balances revealed texts with analogical deduction and consideration of public welfare. This school pioneered many legal concepts and mechanisms that would influence all subsequent Islamic legal theory. Historically patronized by various Islamic empires, particularly the Abbasids and Ottomans, the Hanafi school remains the most widely followed madhab globally, predominant across Central Asia, South Asia, the Balkans, Turkey, parts of the Middle East, and among diaspora communities originating from these regions.
