The Moorish Science Temple of America is an early 20th-century religious movement founded in the United States by Noble Drew Ali. Blending elements of Islam, Christianity, and various esoteric traditions, the movement sought to provide African Americans with a new sense of identity, dignity, and spiritual purpose. Though not recognized as orthodox Islam, the Moorish Science Temple has had a lasting influence on later African American Muslim movements.
