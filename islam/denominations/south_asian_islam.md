# South Asian Islam

![South Asian Islamic Architecture](south_asian_mosque.jpg)

Islam in South Asia represents one of the world's largest and most diverse manifestations of the faith, encompassing modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and parts of Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. Spreading through trade, Sufi missionary activity, and conquest, Islam developed distinctive expressions that reflected the region's cultural diversity and pre-existing religious landscape. With approximately 600 million Muslims, the subcontinent is home to a rich tapestry of Islamic traditions, spanning multiple legal schools, theological approaches, Sufi orders, and reform movements. South Asian Islam has historically been characterized by its synthesis with local cultures, development of distinctive scholarly traditions, and ongoing negotiation between reformist and traditionalist tendencies.
