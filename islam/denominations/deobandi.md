![Darul Uloom Deoband](darul_uloom_deoband.jpg)

The Deobandi movement is a major Sunni Islamic revivalist movement that originated at Darul Uloom Deoband in India in 1866. Named after the town of Deoband in Uttar Pradesh, this theological school emphasizes a strict adherence to the Hanafi school of jurisprudence and a rejection of practices it considers un-Islamic innovations (bid'ah). The movement has significantly shaped religious discourse in South Asia and, through diaspora communities and affiliated institutions, has expanded its influence globally, particularly in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom.
