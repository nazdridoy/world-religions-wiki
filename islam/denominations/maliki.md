# Maliki School

![Maliki School Representation](maliki.jpg)

The Maliki School (المذهب المالكي, al-Madhhab al-Māliki) is one of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) within Sunni Islam, founded by Imam Malik ibn Anas (711-795 CE) in the city of Medina. Distinguished by its reliance on the practices of the people of Medina as a key source of legal guidance, the Maliki madhab places special emphasis on the living tradition ('amal) of the Prophet Muhammad's city as preserved by its early scholars and inhabitants. This school developed a comprehensive methodology that balances textual sources with consideration of public interest (maslaha) and customary practice ('urf), creating a pragmatic yet principled approach to Islamic law. Today, the Maliki school remains predominant across North and West Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula, continuing to evolve while maintaining its distinctive methodological approach.
