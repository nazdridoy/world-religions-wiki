# Contemporary Marjas

![Marjas of Twelver Shiism](contemporary_marjas.jpg)

The marja al-taqlid (plural: maraji), literally "source of emulation," represents the highest level of religious authority in Twelver Shiism. These senior clerics have achieved the status of "Grand Ayatollah" through decades of scholarly work and have established themselves as qualified to issue independent legal rulings. Contemporary marjas continue a centuries-old tradition of Shia religious leadership, adapting it to modern challenges while maintaining their central role in providing guidance to millions of believers who choose to follow their religious verdicts on matters from daily religious practice to complex social issues.
