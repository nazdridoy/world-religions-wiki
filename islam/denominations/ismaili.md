![Ismaili Center and Mosque](ismaili_center.jpg)

Ismaili Islam, also known as Ismailism, is the second-largest branch of Shia Islam, known for its emphasis on esoteric interpretation (ta'wil) of Islamic texts, philosophical approach to religious doctrine, and centralized living leadership through a hereditary Imamate. Taking its name from Ismail ibn Jafar, whom they recognize as the rightful successor to the sixth Imam Jafar al-Sadiq, Ismailis diverged from the majority Twelver Shia tradition in the 8th century CE. Today's global Ismaili community of approximately 15 million is diverse, with significant populations across Central and South Asia, East Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North America, united under the leadership of Prince Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th hereditary Imam.
