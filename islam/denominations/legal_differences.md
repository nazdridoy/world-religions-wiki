# Legal Differences in Islam

![Islamic Legal Schools](legal_differences.jpg)

Legal differences in Islam represent the diverse interpretations and methodologies that have developed within Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) across various schools of thought and denominational lines. While all Muslims acknowledge the Quran and Sunnah as primary sources of law, significant variations exist in how these sources are understood, prioritized, and applied to derive legal rulings. These differences reflect not only theological distinctions but also historical developments, cultural contexts, and varying approaches to legal reasoning. Understanding these legal differences provides crucial insight into the rich diversity of Islamic legal thought and practice across the Muslim world.
