# Feminist Islam

![Muslim women's gathering](feminist_islam.jpg)

Islamic feminism is an intellectual and social movement that seeks to reclaim gender equality as a foundational principle within Islam, challenging patriarchal interpretations of religious texts and advocating for women's rights and full participation in religious and social life. Emerging prominently in the late 20th century, this approach combines Islamic theological frameworks with feminist analysis to demonstrate that gender justice is inherent to authentic Islamic teachings rather than a Western imposition. Islamic feminists engage in critical reinterpretation of the Quran, hadith, and Islamic jurisprudence, distinguishing between divine revelation and male-centered historical interpretations that have dominated traditional scholarship.
