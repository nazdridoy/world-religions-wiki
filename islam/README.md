# Islam

Islam is a monotheistic Abrahamic religion originating in the 7th century CE with the revelations received by the Prophet Muhammad in Arabia. With approximately 1.9 billion adherents worldwide, it is the second-largest religion. Islam teaches the oneness of God (Allah) and recognizes Muhammad as the final prophet in a lineage of prophets that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.

## Overview

Islam means "submission to God" and centers on the belief in Allah as the one and only God worthy of worship. Muslims follow the teachings found in the Quran, believed to be the literal word of God as revealed to Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel over 23 years. The Sunnah, or example of Muhammad's life and teachings recorded in Hadith literature, provides practical guidance for implementing Islamic principles.

Throughout its 1,400-year history, Islam has developed rich theological, philosophical, scientific, and cultural traditions while maintaining core beliefs in monotheism, prophetic guidance, and ethical living. Islam has profoundly influenced world history, architecture, science, literature, and social systems across diverse civilizations.
