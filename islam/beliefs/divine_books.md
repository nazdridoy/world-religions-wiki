# Divine Books (الكتب السماوية)

![Illustration of sacred Islamic scriptures](divine_books.jpg)

Belief in Divine Books or Scriptures (Kutub) constitutes the third article of Islamic faith, affirming that Allah has revealed guidance to humanity throughout history through divinely inspired texts. This doctrine holds that God communicated His will and guidance to selected prophets who then transmitted these teachings to their communities. While Islam acknowledges numerous divine revelations throughout human history, it specifically names four major scriptures, with the Quran being considered the final, complete, and uncorrupted divine revelation.

## Theological Foundation

The concept of divine revelation is foundational to Islamic theology, establishing a direct connection between the Creator and creation:

> "We have sent revelation to you [Muhammad] as We sent revelation to Noah and the prophets after him; We sent revelation to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms." (Quran 4:163)

Islamic belief holds that:

* Allah communicates guidance to humanity through chosen messengers
* Revelation is a mercy and necessity for human salvation and well-being
* Divine books provide the foundation for moral, spiritual, and social order
* Each scripture was appropriate to its time and community
* All authentic divine messages contain the same essential truths
* The Quran serves as the criterion (furqan) by which other scriptures are evaluated

## Major Divine Books

Islamic tradition identifies four major scriptures revealed by Allah:

### 1. The Torah (Tawrat - التوراة)

* Revealed to Prophet Moses (Musa) on Mount Sinai
* Originally contained pure monotheistic teachings and divine law
* Provided guidance for the Children of Israel
* Muslims believe the original text has undergone alterations over time
* Corresponds broadly to the Pentateuch (first five books of the Hebrew Bible)

### 2. The Psalms (Zabur - الزبور)

* Revealed to Prophet David (Dawud)
* Primarily consisted of divine praises, spiritual wisdom, and prophecies
* Emphasized devotional aspects of faith
* Generally associated with the Biblical Book of Psalms
* Contained spiritual guidance rather than comprehensive legal code

### 3. The Gospel (Injil - الإنجيل)

* Revealed to Prophet Jesus (Isa)
* Contained guidance and light, confirming previous revelations
* Taught pure monotheism and moral principles
* Not directly equivalent to the four canonical Gospels of the New Testament
* Muslims believe Jesus received a single revelation from Allah

### 4. The Quran (القرآن)

* Revealed to Prophet Muhammad over 23 years
* Considered the literal word of Allah, preserved without alteration
* Confirms truths from previous revelations while correcting deviations
* Serves as the final revelation intended for all humanity
* Provides comprehensive guidance for individual and collective life

## Other Mentioned Scriptures

The Quran and hadith also refer to other divine revelations:

* **Scrolls of Abraham (Suhuf Ibrahim)**: Early revelations given to Prophet Abraham
* **Scrolls of Moses (Suhuf Musa)**: Distinct from the Torah, these were earlier revelations
* **Books of the Prophets**: References to revelations given to various prophets

## Nature of Divine Revelation

Islamic theology distinguishes various types of divine communication:

### Forms of Revelation (Wahy)

* **Direct speech**: Allah speaking directly to a prophet (as with Moses)
* **Through an angel**: Divine message delivered by the angel Gabriel (as with Muhammad)
* **Divine inspiration**: God placing knowledge directly in the heart of the prophet
* **Dreams**: Truthful visions granted to prophets (especially mentioned for Abraham)

### Characteristics of Divine Books

* **Divine origin**: Words or meanings from Allah, not human composition
* **Truth and guidance**: Containing absolute truth without error in original form
* **Confirmation**: Each scripture confirming previous revelations
* **Progression**: Revealing divine law appropriate for each community and time
* **Culmination**: Building toward the complete and final revelation in the Quran

## Islamic View of Scriptural History

The Islamic understanding of previous scriptures includes the concept of textual corruption (tahrif):

* **Original Purity**: All divine books were originally pure, accurate revelations
* **Gradual Alteration**: Over time, human interference led to changes in earlier texts
* **Types of Corruption**:
  * Textual alterations (tahrif al-lafz)
  * Misinterpretation (tahrif al-ma'na)
  * Contextual distortion
  * Additions and deletions
* **Preservation of Core Messages**: Despite alterations, some original teachings remain
* **Quranic Preservation**: Unique divine protection guaranteed for the Quran alone

> "Indeed, it is We who sent down the Quran and indeed, We will be its guardian." (Quran 15:9)

## Relationship Between Scriptures

Islamic theology establishes a particular relationship between divine revelations:

* **Continuity**: All divine books form a continuous chain of guidance
* **Progression**: Each revelation built upon and expanded previous teachings
* **Confirmation**: Later scriptures verify the truth of earlier revelations
* **Correction**: The Quran rectifies deviations that entered earlier texts
* **Completion**: The Quranic revelation completes and perfects divine guidance
* **Supersession (Naskh)**: The Quran's legal framework supersedes earlier laws

## Islamic Approach to Previous Scriptures

Muslims are encouraged to adopt a respectful but discerning approach to earlier texts:

* **Respect**: Honoring all divinely revealed books in their original forms
* **Belief**: Affirming their divine origin and original authenticity
* **Caution**: Recognizing potential alterations in current versions
* **Verification**: Using the Quran as the criterion to evaluate other scriptural content
* **Engagement**: Studying commonalities and differences between traditions

## Contemporary Implications

Belief in divine books influences modern Islamic thought in several ways:

* **Interfaith Dialogue**: Provides foundation for engagement with other Abrahamic faiths
* **Theological Pluralism**: Shapes Islamic understanding of religious diversity
* **Scriptural Studies**: Motivates comparative analysis of religious texts
* **Quranic Primacy**: Emphasizes the Quran as the definitive source for Islamic practice
* **Universal Message**: Reinforces the universal nature of divine guidance

## Academic Perspectives

Contemporary scholarship examines the relationship between Islamic and other scriptures:

* Historical-critical analysis of textual relationships
* Comparative study of ethical and theological themes
* Examination of shared narratives and figures
* Analysis of translation and transmission issues
* Study of interpretive traditions across religions

## Common Misconceptions

Several misunderstandings exist regarding the Islamic view of divine books:

* **Complete Rejection**: Mistaken belief that Islam rejects all content in previous scriptures
* **Equivalence**: Incorrect assumption that Muslims view all scriptures as equally authoritative
* **Literalism**: Misunderstanding that Islam necessarily takes a literalist approach to scriptural interpretation
* **Anti-Intellectualism**: False notion that Islamic tradition discourages critical study of texts
* **Exclusivism**: Erroneous belief that Islam denies salvation to followers of earlier revelations
