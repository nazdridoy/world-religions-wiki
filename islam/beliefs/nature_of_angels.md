![Islamic artistic depiction of angels](nature_of_angels.jpg)

In Islamic theology, angels (malƒÅ'ikah) are celestial beings created from light who serve as Allah's messengers and agents in the cosmos. Unlike humans, angels are characterized by their complete obedience to divine will, lack of free will to disobey God, and their existence in an imperceptible realm beyond ordinary human perception. Angels function as a fundamental element of Islamic cosmology and theology, playing vital roles in revelation, divine governance of the universe, human affairs, and eschatological events. Belief in angels constitutes the second article of Islamic faith, highlighting their essential place in the religion's worldview.

- Pre-date human creation and witnessed Adam's formation
- Possess no gender, unlike humans and jinn
- Neither eat nor drink, having no physical needs
- Do not reproduce or have offspring
