# Israfil (إسرافيل)

![Symbolic representation of the trumpet of Israfil](israfil.jpg)

Israfil (also spelled Israfeel or Seraphiel) is one of the four principal archangels in Islamic tradition, distinguished primarily by his eschatological role. He is known as the angel who will blow the trumpet (Sur) to signal the coming of the Day of Judgment and the resurrection of all souls. Although not mentioned by name in the Quran, Israfil's existence and function are firmly established in hadith literature and Islamic eschatological traditions. As with all angels in Islam, Israfil is created from light, possesses no free will to disobey Allah, and serves as the perfect executor of divine commands.

## Quranic Foundation

While Israfil is not explicitly named in the Quran, several verses refer to the angel with the trumpet, which Islamic tradition identifies as Israfil:

> "And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on." (Quran 39:68)

> "And the Horn will be blown; and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten." (Quran 36:51)

> "The Day the Horn is blown and you will come forth in multitudes." (Quran 78:18)

These verses establish the fundamental role that Islamic tradition attributes to Israfil without specifically naming him.
