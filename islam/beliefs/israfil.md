# Israfil (إسرافيل)

![Symbolic representation of the trumpet of Israfil](israfil.jpg)

Israfil (also spelled Israfeel or Seraphiel) is one of the four principal archangels in Islamic tradition, distinguished primarily by his eschatological role. He is known as the angel who will blow the trumpet (Sur) to signal the coming of the Day of Judgment and the resurrection of all souls. Although not mentioned by name in the Quran, Israfil's existence and function are firmly established in hadith literature and Islamic eschatological traditions. As with all angels in Islam, Israfil is created from light, possesses no free will to disobey Allah, and serves as the perfect executor of divine commands.

## Etymology and Names

The name Israfil (إسرافيل) is not of Arabic origin but rather has Semitic roots. Various interpretations of the name include:

1. **Isra** - From the Hebrew "seraph," meaning "burning one" or "fiery one"
2. **Fil** - May derive from "El," a Semitic term for deity

In Islamic tradition, Israfil is known by several names and titles:
- **Sahib al-Sur** (Bearer of the Trumpet)
- **Sahib al-Nafkh** (Master of the Blast)
- **Malak al-Ba'th** (Angel of Resurrection)
- **Al-Munadi** (The Caller)
- **Hamel Arsh Allah** (One of the Bearers of Allah's Throne)

In some traditions, Israfil is associated with the seraph mentioned in Judeo-Christian sources, and Islamic scholars have sometimes identified him with Raphael in Biblical tradition, though their roles differ significantly. The Quran refers to him indirectly as "the one who blows the trumpet" without naming him specifically.

## Quranic Foundation

While Israfil is not explicitly named in the Quran, several verses refer to the angel with the trumpet, which Islamic tradition identifies as Israfil:

> "And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on." (Quran 39:68)

> "And the Horn will be blown; and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten." (Quran 36:51)

> "The Day the Horn is blown and you will come forth in multitudes." (Quran 78:18)

> "And the Horn is blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth swoon away, save him whom Allah wills..." (Quran 69:13)

> "It will be but a single shout, so suddenly they will be awakened." (Quran 79:13)

These verses establish the fundamental role that Islamic tradition attributes to Israfil without specifically naming him. The emphasis on the Horn (Sur) and its cosmic significance appears throughout the Quran, particularly in discussions of the Day of Judgment.

## Creation and Status

According to Islamic tradition, Israfil was among the first angels created by Allah. Several accounts mention:

1. **Primordial Creation** - Created before the heavens and earth, as part of the primary angelic realm
2. **Divine Light Origin** - Formed from divine light (nur), like all angels
3. **Throne Bearer** - One of four angels (along with Jibril, Mikail, and Azrael) who bear Allah's Throne
4. **Elite Status** - Member of the most elite class of angels known as "al-Mala'ikah al-Muqarrabun" (The Angels Brought Near)
5. **Hierarchy** - Often mentioned third in the hierarchy of angels after Jibril and Mikail

When Allah created Israfil, it is said that He placed before him the Preserved Tablet (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz) containing all divine decrees, giving him knowledge of the appointed time for the Day of Judgment. However, even Israfil does not know when the command to blow the trumpet will come, as this knowledge belongs exclusively to Allah.

## Attributes and Characteristics

According to Islamic tradition, Israfil possesses several distinctive attributes:

### Physical Description

- Created from divine light (nur)
- Possesses magnificent wings that stretch from East to West
- In some traditions, described with four wings: one extending to the east, one to the west, one to cover his body, and one protecting him from the divine glory
- Body contains innumerable eyes, shedding tears in anticipation of judgment
- Of immense size, befitting his cosmic role
- Holds the trumpet (Sur) ready to be blown
- Some traditions describe him as having a body covered with fine hair and countless mouths
- His head is said to reach the highest heaven and his feet extend below the seventh earth
- The trumpet itself is described as an enormous horn of light that extends from heaven to earth
- Some accounts mention that he has remained in the same position since creation, with the trumpet at his lips, eyes fixed on the Divine Throne, waiting for the command

### The Trumpet (Sur)

According to some narrations, the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: "How can I enjoy life when the bearer of the Horn has placed it at his lips, tilted his forehead, and is listening attentively for the command to blow it?"

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Primary Role: The Trumpet Blower

Israfil's central function is to sound the trumpet (Sur) that signals key eschatological events:

#### The Three Blasts

According to detailed eschatological traditions, Israfil will blow the trumpet three times:

1. **Nafkhat al-Faza' (The Blast of Terror)**
   - Will cause extreme fear among all creation
   - Mountains will be uprooted and turned to dust
   - Seas will boil and overflow
   - The sun will darken and stars will fall
   - People will be filled with terror but not yet perish

2. **Nafkhat al-Sa'iq (The Blast of Swooning/Death)**
   - All living creatures in heaven and earth will die
   - Only Allah will remain, along with those He exempts (possibly including Israfil himself)
   - The universe will enter a period of complete lifelessness
   - According to some traditions, forty years will pass between this blast and the next

3. **Nafkhat al-Ba'th (The Blast of Resurrection)**
   - All souls will be returned to recreated bodies
   - All humanity from the first to the last will rise from their graves
   - The gathering (Hashr) for judgment will begin
   - The Day of Judgment will commence

Israfil stands ever-ready, trumpet at his lips, awaiting Allah's command. He will blow with divine timing, neither delaying nor hastening. His blast will be heard by all creation across all realms.

### Period Between Blasts

According to various hadith, there will be specific periods between these blasts:

- Some traditions mention forty days between the first and second blasts
- Other narrations suggest forty years between the second and third blasts
- During this interim period, all creation except Allah (and those He exempts) will cease to exist
- Israfil himself may be among those who die after the second blast and then be resurrected first to blow the third blast

### Cosmic Significance

Beyond the trumpet-blowing, traditions associate additional responsibilities with Israfil:

- In some accounts, dictating divine decrees to other angels
- Delivering certain forms of revelation before Jibril's appointment
- Standing watch over the celestial realms
- Serving as one of the bearers of Allah's throne
- Participating in cosmic governance alongside other archangels
- Recording names of those born and those who will die
- Maintaining cosmic order until the appointed time
- Mediating certain divine communications to other angels

### Other Traditional Attributions

Various Islamic scholarly traditions credit Israfil with additional functions:

## Daily Tasks and Current State

While Israfil is primarily known for his future role in blowing the trumpet, traditions speak of his current activities while awaiting that moment:

1. **Perpetual Worship** - Engaged in constant glorification of Allah
2. **Divine Throne** - One of the angels who bear Allah's Throne

According to one tradition, Israfil has remained in the same position since creation - with the trumpet at his lips and his eyes fixed on the Throne of Allah, never blinking lest the command come in that instant and he miss it. This represents the perfect servant's absolute dedication to his appointed task.

## Interactions with Prophets

Though not as extensively documented as Jibril's interactions with prophets, Islamic tradition preserves several accounts of Israfil's encounters with various prophets:

- In Sahih Muslim, the Prophet Muhammad is reported to have prayed: "O Allah, Lord of Jibril, Mika'il, and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and the earth..."

- Various traditions describe Muhammad's question to Jibril about Israfil's perpetual readiness with the trumpet

- In another narration: "Allah has created Israfil, and since his creation, he has fixed his eyes on the Throne, never blinking, out of fear that the command will come while his eyes are closed."

### Eschatological Narratives

Islamic eschatological literature elaborates on Israfil's role in the end times:
