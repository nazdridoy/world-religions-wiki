# Kalam (علم الكلام)

![Illustration of Islamic theological discourse](kalam.jpg)

Kalam, often translated as Islamic scholastic theology or dialectical theology, is the discipline concerned with seeking theological principles through dialectic and rational argument. The term itself means "speech" or "discourse" in Arabic, reflecting its nature as an intellectual conversation about Islamic doctrine. Emerging during the formative period of Islamic civilization when Muslims encountered other religious and philosophical traditions, Kalam developed systematic rational defenses of Islamic beliefs against various intellectual challenges. It represents Islamic theology's most sophisticated theoretical expression, combining revealed knowledge with logical reasoning to establish coherent frameworks for understanding God, creation, and the human condition.

## Historical Development

### Formative Period (8th-9th centuries)

* Emerged in response to internal sectarian disputes and external intellectual challenges
* Early debates focused on free will vs. determinism and divine justice
* Political tensions following civil wars contributed to theological divisions
* Wasil ibn Ata and his followers established the Mu'tazilite school
* Greek philosophical concepts gradually incorporated into theological discourse
* Translation movement during Abbasid caliphate introduced Aristotelian logic

### Classical Period (10th-12th centuries)

* Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 936) established the Ash'arite school after leaving Mu'tazilite thought
* Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 944) founded the Maturidite school, providing another alternative
* Systematization of theological positions through comprehensive treatises
* Development of sophisticated logical arguments and counterarguments
* Integration of philosophical concepts within traditional religious frameworks
* Institutionalization of theological education in madrasas

### Later Developments (13th-19th centuries)

* Further refinement by figures like Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 1209) and al-Taftazani (d. 1390)
* Interaction with Falsafa (Islamic philosophy) and tensions with Sufism
* Incorporation of Ibn Sina's (Avicenna) metaphysical insights
* Gradual decline in innovation as positions solidified within major schools
* Regional variations emerging with distinctive emphases
* Challenges from traditionalist movements skeptical of rationalistic theology

### Modern Transformations (20th century onward)

* Revitalization of kalam in response to Western philosophy and science
* Engagement with modern philosophical movements and scientific discoveries
* Addressing challenges of secularism, atheism, and religious pluralism
* Development of "New Ilm al-Kalam" tackling contemporary intellectual issues
* Incorporation of postcolonial and decolonial perspectives
* Digital proliferation of theological debates and resources

## Major Schools

### Mu'tazilite School

* Emphasized divine justice ('adl) and unity (tawhid) as foundational principles
* Advocated rationalism and the created (non-eternal) nature of the Quran
* Asserted human free will and responsibility (qadar)
* Denied the visibility of God in the afterlife
* Maintained an intermediary position for grave sinners between belief and disbelief
* Temporarily gained political support during the Abbasid "Mihna" (inquisition)
* Declined after al-Mutawakkil's reversal of state support

### Ash'arite School

* Founded by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari, a former Mu'tazilite
* Positioned itself as a middle path between pure rationalism and literalism
* Affirmed divine attributes while avoiding anthropomorphism
* Developed the concept of "acquisition" (kasb) to reconcile predestination with moral responsibility
* Endorsed atomism as a physical theory compatible with divine omnipotence
* Maintained that the Quran is the uncreated speech of God
* Became predominant in Sunni orthodox education, especially in Shafi'i circles

### Maturidi School

* Founded by Abu Mansur al-Maturidi in Samarqand (Central Asia)
* Closely aligned with Hanafi legal school
* Granted more scope to human reason than Ash'arism, less than Mu'tazilism
* Distinguished between knowledge gained through perception and revelation
* Allowed greater human agency while maintaining divine sovereignty
* Emphasized practical ethics and social dimensions of faith
* Predominant in Turkish, Central Asian, and South Asian regions

### Traditionalist Approach

* Represented primarily by Hanbali scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328)
* Skeptical of excessive rationalism and philosophical methodology
* Emphasized adherence to scriptural texts and prophetic tradition
* Criticized kalam as an innovation potentially leading to deviance
* Rejected allegorical interpretations of divine attributes
* Later evolved into various movements including modern Salafism
* Maintained that theological truth comes from revelation, not reason alone
