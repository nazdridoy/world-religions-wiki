Jannah (Paradise) is the ultimate reward and final abode of the righteous in Islamic belief. Described in vivid detail throughout the Quran and Hadith, Jannah represents divine perfection and everlasting bliss, contrasting with the temporal nature of worldly existence and the punishment of Jahannam (Hell).
