# Isa (Jesus) in Islamic Belief

![Artistic representation of Jesus in Islamic tradition](isa.jpg)

In Islamic theology, Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus, son of Mary) occupies a position of exceptional honor as one of the most distinguished prophets and messengers of Allah. While the Islamic understanding of Jesus differs significantly from Christian theology, the Quran and Islamic tradition accord him a special status, emphasizing his miraculous birth, his message of pure monotheism, his extraordinary miracles, and his role in eschatology. Muslims revere Jesus as a mighty messenger who called people to worship the One God, but reject the Christian doctrines of his divinity, crucifixion, and atonement. This distinctive Islamic perspective on Jesus represents both important theological continuity with and critical divergence from Christian tradition, making Jesus a significant figure in Islamic-Christian dialogue and comparative theology.

## Quranic Representation

### Birth and Early Life

* **Miraculous Conception**: "And mention, [O Muhammad], in the Book [the story of] Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east. And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Angel [Gabriel], and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man." (Quran 19:16-17)

* **Divine Origin of Jesus**: "She said, 'How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?' He said, 'Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, "It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed."'" (Quran 19:20-21)

* **Mary's Delivery**: "So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, 'Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten.'" (Quran 19:22-23)

* **Jesus Speaking as an Infant**: "But he called her from below her, 'Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream. And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates. So eat and drink and be contented. And if you see from among humanity anyone, say, "Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Merciful abstention, so I will not speak today to [any] man."'" (Quran 19:24-26)

* **Defense of Mary**: "Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, 'O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented. O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.' So she pointed to him. They said, 'How can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child?' [Jesus] said, 'Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.'" (Quran 19:27-30)

### Jesus's Mission and Message

* **Divine Messenger with Scripture**: "And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous." (Quran 5:46)

* **Message of Monotheism**: "And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, 'O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, "Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?"' He will say, 'Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it.'" (Quran 5:116)

* **Confirmation of Torah**: "And [I have come] confirming what was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. And I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me." (Quran 3:50)

### Miracles of Jesus

* **Multiple Miracles**: "And [make him] a messenger to the Children of Israel, [who will say], 'Indeed I have come to you with a sign from your Lord in that I design for you from clay [that which is] like the form of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird by permission of Allah. And I cure the blind and the leper, and I give life to the dead - by permission of Allah. And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers.'" (Quran 3:49)

* **Table from Heaven**: "When the disciples said, 'O Jesus, Son of Mary, can your Lord send down to us a table [spread with food] from heaven?' [Jesus] said, 'Fear Allah, if you should be believers.' They said, 'We wish to eat from it and let our hearts be reassured and know that you have been truthful to us and be among its witnesses.' Said Jesus, the son of Mary, 'O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table [spread with food] from heaven to be for us a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You. And provide for us, and You are the best of providers.'" (Quran 5:112-114)

### Rejection of Crucifixion

* **Appearance of Crucifixion**: "And [for] their saying, 'Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.' And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise." (Quran 4:157-158)

### Eschatological Role

* **Sign of the Hour**: "And indeed, Jesus will be [a sign for] knowledge of the Hour, so be not in doubt of it, and follow Me. This is a straight path." (Quran 43:61)

### Jesus's Humanity and Servitude

* **Created Being**: "Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him, 'Be,' and he was." (Quran 3:59)

* **Servant of Allah**: "He [Jesus] was not but a servant upon whom We bestowed favor, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel." (Quran 43:59)

* **Not Divine**: "O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a messenger of Allah and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul [created at a command] from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist - it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son." (Quran 4:171)
