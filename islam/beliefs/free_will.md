# Free Will and Divine Decree in Islam

![Conceptual illustration of human choice and divine determination](free_will.jpg)

In Islamic theology, the relationship between human free will and divine decree (qadar) represents one of the most profound and persistent theological questions. This complex topic addresses the apparent paradox between Allah's absolute sovereignty and omniscience on one hand, and meaningful human moral responsibility on the other. Throughout Islamic intellectual history, various theological schools have developed distinctive frameworks attempting to reconcile these seemingly opposing principles. The discussion encompasses fundamental questions about divine justice, human accountability, the nature of causality, and the limits of human freedom within a universe governed by divine will. Rather than presenting a simple resolution, Islamic tradition offers nuanced perspectives that recognize both divine prerogative and human agency.

## Quranic Foundation

The Quran contains numerous verses addressing both divine decree and human responsibility:

### Verses Emphasizing Divine Decree

* "No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but is inscribed in the Book of Decrees before We bring it into existence" (57:22)
* "And not an atom's weight in the earth or in the heaven escapes your Lord, nor what is less than that or greater than that, but it is in a Clear Book" (10:61)
* "And you do not will except that Allah wills - Lord of the worlds" (81:29)
* "Allah created you and what you do" (37:96)
* "Whomever Allah wills to guide, He expands his breast to Islam; and whomever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast tight and constricted" (6:125)

### Verses Emphasizing Human Responsibility

* "Indeed, Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves" (13:11)
* "Whoever does righteousness - it is for his soul; and whoever does evil - it is against it" (41:46)
* "This is the Day of Truth; so let whoever wills take a path to his Lord" (78:39)
* "Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or ungrateful" (76:3)
* "And say, 'The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve'" (18:29)

### Integration of Both Principles

* "And you do not will except that Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise" (76:30)
* "For each [religious law] We have appointed among you a clear way and a methodology. Had Allah willed, He would have made you a single community, but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you" (5:48)
* "And if Allah had willed, He could have made you [of] one religion, but He sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills" (16:93)

## Historical Theological Positions

### Jabriyyah (Determinists)

* Emerged in early Islamic history, associated with Jahm ibn Safwan (d. 746)
* Emphasized absolute divine predestination and omnipotence
* Viewed humans as having no real agency in their actions
* Compared humans to feathers blown by the wind
* Attributed all actions directly to God as the sole true actor
* Eventually rejected by mainstream Islamic theology

### Qadariyyah (Early Proponents of Free Will)

* Early theological movement emphasizing human freedom
* Maintained humans create their own actions independently
* Sought to preserve divine justice by denying predestination
* Argued God's foreknowledge doesn't necessitate predetermination
* Criticized for limiting divine sovereignty
* Viewed as heretical by many early authorities

### Mu'tazilite Position

* Developed sophisticated framework emphasizing divine justice and human freedom
* Humans create their own actions through power granted by God
* God creates human capacity (istita'a) but humans utilize it freely
* Divine justice requires genuine human moral responsibility
* Divine foreknowledge doesn't negate human choice
* God's wisdom necessitates human freedom for accountability

### Ash'arite Position

* Dominant in Sunni theology, seeking middle ground between determinism and libertarianism
* Developed theory of "acquisition" (kasb) where humans "acquire" actions God creates
* God creates both the human will and the action
* Humans have responsibility through "acquisition" without independent creation
* Distinguished between compulsion and moral responsibility
* Emphasized divine omnipotence while preserving ethical accountability

### Maturidi Position

* Another major Sunni approach, often associated with Hanafi jurisprudence
* Similar to Ash'arites but granting more scope to human agency
* Humans possess real but derived causal efficacy
* God creates the capacity and potential actions, humans choose between them
* Greater emphasis on human choice than Ash'arites
* Preserved divine sovereignty while affirming genuine human choice

### Shia Perspectives

* Various positions across different Shi'ite groups
* Classic Twelver position: "Neither complete compulsion nor complete delegation, but a matter between the two"
* Greater emphasis on divine justice ('adl) as a fundamental principle
* Human freedom essential for divine justice
* Responsibility requires capability and choice
* Balance between divine decree and human freedom

## Philosophical Concepts

### Causality

* Question of whether secondary causes have real efficacy
* Ash'arites tended toward occasionalism (God creates each moment anew)
* Some traditions emphasize natural causation operating by divine permission
* Distinctions between metaphysical causation and apparent causation
* Different understandings of the relationship between divine and created causes

### Knowledge and Action

* God's foreknowledge and its relationship to human choice
* Whether divine knowledge necessitates events or simply encompasses them
* Distinction between God knowing what will happen and causing it to happen
* Question of whether knowledge is active or passive
* Temporal relationship between divine knowledge and human action

### Divine Attributes

* How divine power, knowledge, will, and justice relate to human freedom
* Balance between affirming all divine attributes without contradiction
* Relationship between divine mercy and divine justice
* Whether divine will can be differentiated from divine decree
* Understanding divine wisdom in creation of free beings

### Ethical Responsibility

* Requirements for moral accountability
* Various conceptions of human capability (istita'a, qudra)
* When human actions can be properly attributed to the actor
* Role of intention versus outcome in responsibility
* Balance between acknowledging human weakness and affirming responsibility

## Key Theological Frameworks

### Two Types of Divine Will

* **Creative Will** (al-irada al-kawniyya): God's will regarding what actually exists
* **Legislative Will** (al-irada al-shar'iyya): God's will regarding what should be done
* God creates through creative will but commands through legislative will
* Explains how sin exists (by creative will) while being disliked by God (legislative will)
* Helps reconcile verses emphasizing both divine decree and human choice

### Categories of Divine Decree

* **Pre-eternal Decree**: God's knowledge and writing of all events before creation
* **Ongoing Decree**: Divine permission and creation of events as they occur
* **Universal Decree**: General laws governing existence
* **Particular Decree**: Specific events in individual lives
* Distinctions help explain different Quranic emphases on decree

### Levels of Qadar

1. **Divine Knowledge**: God's eternal awareness of all possibilities and actualities
2. **Divine Writing**: Recording all events in the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz)
3. **Divine Will**: God's permission for events to occur
4. **Divine Creation**: God bringing events into existence

### Approaches to Reconciliation

* **Functional Approach**: Practical emphasis on human responsibility despite theoretical problems
* **Mystery Approach**: Accepting apparent contradiction as beyond human comprehension
* **Analogical Approach**: Using imperfect analogies like king-subject relationships
* **Metaphysical Approach**: Sophisticated philosophical reconciliations
* **Ethical Approach**: Focusing on practical implications for conduct

## Practical Implications

### Everyday Religious Life

* Balance between reliance on God (tawakkul) and personal effort
* Supplication (du'a) as meaningful interaction with divine decree
* Acceptance of outcomes (ridha) while still making choices
* Impact on understanding trials and blessings
