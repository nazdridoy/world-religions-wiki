# Musa (Moses)

![Musa receiving revelation on Mount Tur](musa.jpg)

In Islamic tradition, Musa (Moses) stands as one of the greatest prophets and messengers of Allah, holding the distinguished title of Kalīmullah ("The one who spoke with Allah"). The Quran mentions Musa more than any other prophet, with his narrative appearing across multiple chapters. His life story encompasses birth under tyranny, divine selection for prophethood, confrontation with Pharaoh, liberation of the Israelites, receipt of divine law, and leadership through the wilderness. As the recipient of the Torah (Tawrat), Musa is revered as a lawgiver and exemplifies steadfastness in the face of oppression, patience with his people, and direct communication with the Divine.

## Birth and Early Life

Musa's journey began under extraordinary circumstances:

- Born during Pharaoh's persecution of the Israelites, when male infants were being killed
- His mother received divine inspiration to place him in a basket on the Nile
- Pharaoh's household found him, with Pharaoh's wife (Asiya) advocating to adopt him
- Musa's sister followed the basket and arranged for his own mother to nurse him
- Raised in the palace with royal privileges while remaining connected to his heritage
- In adulthood, intervened when seeing an Egyptian beating an Israelite
- Accidentally killed the Egyptian and fled Egypt fearing retribution
- Journeyed to Midian where he helped water the flocks of the daughters of an elderly man
- Married one of the daughters and lived as a shepherd for several years

## The Call to Prophethood

Musa's divine commission came after his period in Midian:

- Noticed a fire while traveling with his family and went to investigate
- At the sacred valley of Tuwa, Allah spoke to him directly from a burning bush
- Received two initial signs: his staff transforming into a serpent and his hand becoming radiant
- Commissioned to return to Egypt and call Pharaoh to monotheism
- Requested his brother Harun (Aaron) as an assistant due to his own speech impediment
- Allah granted his request, making Harun a prophet alongside him
- Given specific instructions for confronting Pharaoh and delivering the Israelites

## Confrontation with Pharaoh

The showdown with Pharaoh represents a central element in Musa's prophetic mission:

- Returned to Egypt and presented himself before Pharaoh with divine signs
- Debated with Pharaoh who claimed divinity for himself
- Performed miracles including the transformation of his staff and his radiant hand
- Challenged Pharaoh's magicians in a public contest
- The magicians recognized the divine nature of Musa's miracles and believed
- Pharaoh intensified persecution of the Israelites in response
- Series of divinely sent plagues afflicted Egypt, including locusts, floods, and frogs
- Pharaoh repeatedly broke promises to release the Israelites
- Eventually led the Israelites out of Egypt in a nighttime exodus

## Parting of the Sea

One of the most dramatic events in Musa's story involves divine intervention at the sea:

- Led the Israelites toward the promised land with Pharaoh's army in pursuit
- Reached the sea with the army closing in, causing panic among the followers
- Reassured his people of Allah's help when they thought themselves trapped
- Commanded by Allah to strike the sea with his staff
- The waters parted, creating a dry path through the sea
- The Israelites crossed safely while Pharaoh's army followed
- The waters closed upon Pharaoh's forces, drowning them
- Pharaoh's attempted last-minute profession of faith was rejected as too late
- Allah preserved Pharaoh's body as a sign for future generations

## Mount Sinai and Divine Law

After the exodus, Musa received divine legislation:

- Led the Israelites to Mount Sinai (Tur Sina)
- Appointed to spend forty nights in communion with Allah on the mountain
- Left his brother Harun in charge of the community
- Received the Torah (Tawrat) containing guidance and laws
- Asked to see Allah directly but was told he could not bear it
- Granted a glimpse of divine manifestation on the mountain which crumbled
- Returned to find his people worshiping a golden calf in his absence
- Confronted Harun and the people over their idolatry
- Broke the tablets in anger but later received them again
- Implemented the divine law among the Israelites

## Wilderness Trials

The period after Sinai involved numerous challenges:

- Led the people through the desert wilderness for forty years
- Struck a rock with his staff to provide water when the people complained of thirst
- Manna and quails were provided as sustenance
- Dealt with continuous complaints, rebellion, and ingratitude
- The people refused to enter the promised land when commanded
- The Israelites were sentenced to wander for forty years due to their disobedience
- Confronted Qarun (Korah), an Israelite who became wealthy and arrogant
- Qarun and his treasures were swallowed by the earth as punishment
- Continued to guide his people despite their difficult nature

## Encounter with Al-Khidr

The Quran narrates Musa's journey with a mysterious servant of Allah:

- Musa sought out a wise man (identified in tradition as Al-Khidr) at the junction of two seas
- The man agreed to allow Musa to follow him on condition of not questioning his actions
- Witnessed three puzzling incidents: damaging a boat, killing a young man, and repairing a wall without compensation
- Questioned each action despite his promise not to do so
- Al-Khidr revealed the hidden wisdom behind each action
- The boat belonged to poor people and was damaged to save it from seizure by a tyrannical king
- The young man would have grown up to oppress his believing parents
- The wall concealed a treasure belonging to orphans that needed protection until they matured
- This encounter taught Musa about the limitations of human knowledge and divine wisdom beyond apparent reality
