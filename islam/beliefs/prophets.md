# Prophets in Islam

![Illustration representing the prophetic tradition in Islam](prophets.jpg)

In Islamic theology, belief in the prophets (anbiyā') and messengers (rusul) sent by Allah constitutes one of the six articles of faith. Islam recognizes a continuous chain of divine guidance throughout human history, with Allah sending numerous prophets to different peoples and nations across time. These divinely appointed individuals were chosen to convey Allah's message, demonstrate exemplary moral character, and guide humanity toward righteousness. From Adam, considered the first human and prophet, to Muhammad, believed to be the final messenger, Islam acknowledges thousands of prophets, though only twenty-five are explicitly named in the Quran. Each prophet is viewed as having received divine revelation suited to their specific historical and cultural context, with Muhammad's message considered universal and eternal.

## Quranic Foundation

### Core Principles

* "Say, [O believers], 'We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.'" (Quran 2:136)

* "The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers, [saying], 'We make no distinction between any of His messengers.' And they say, 'We hear and we obey...'" (Quran 2:285)

* "Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. And We revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Descendants, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the book [of Psalms]." (Quran 4:163)

### Distinction Between Nabi (Prophet) and Rasul (Messenger)

* While all messengers are prophets, not all prophets are messengers
* **Nabi (Prophet)**: Receives divine revelation for personal guidance and for the guidance of followers
* **Rasul (Messenger)**: Receives divine revelation and a new law or scripture
* The Quran uses both terms sometimes distinctly and sometimes interchangeably
* Scholars differ on precise definitions, but generally agree on the greater scope of a messenger's mission

### Number of Prophets

* "And We have already sent messengers before you. Among them are those [whose stories] We have related to you, and among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to you." (Quran 40:78)
* According to hadith traditions, Allah sent 124,000 prophets throughout history
* Only 25 are specifically named in the Quran
* Each nation received divine guidance: "And for every nation is a messenger" (Quran 10:47)
