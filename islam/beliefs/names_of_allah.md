The Names of Allah (Al-Asma al-Husna) refers to the traditional 99 names, attributes, or qualities of God in Islam that describe His perfect nature and characteristics. These names are considered beautiful (husna) and are derived from the Quran and Hadith. Muslims believe that Allah possesses infinite attributes, but these particular 99 names have special significance for worship, remembrance (dhikr), and understanding the divine nature.

## Quranic Foundation

The concept of Allah's names is rooted in the Quran, where Allah says: "The most beautiful names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them" (7:180). The Prophet Muhammad ï·º is reported to have said: "Allah has ninety-nine names, one hundred minus one; whoever enumerates (counts and preserves) them will enter Paradise."
