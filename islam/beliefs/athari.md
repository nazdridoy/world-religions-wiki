# Athari Theology (الأثرية)

![Illustration representing traditionalist Islamic theological approach](athari.jpg)

Athari theology, derived from the Arabic word "athar" (trace, narration, or report), represents the traditionalist approach to Islamic belief that emphasizes strict adherence to the Quran and Sunnah without extensive rational interpretation. This theological orientation prioritizes revealed texts and the understanding of the earliest Muslim generations (salaf) over philosophical speculation or allegorical interpretation. Distinguished by its textual literalism and rejection of speculative theology (kalam), the Athari approach has historically been associated with the Hanbali legal school, though its methodology has adherents across various juristic traditions. In contemporary Islam, Athari theology has experienced significant revival through various Salafi movements that seek to return to what they consider the pristine understanding of the earliest Muslim community.

## Historical Development
