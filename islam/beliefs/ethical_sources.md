# Ethical Sources in Islam

![Islamic sacred texts and scholarly works](ethical_sources.jpg)

Islamic ethics draws from a rich array of sources that establish moral principles, guide ethical reasoning, and inform normative judgments in Muslim life. These sources form a multilayered framework that combines divine revelation, prophetic guidance, scholarly interpretation, and human reason to address moral questions across different contexts and time periods. While the Quran and Sunnah constitute the foundational wellsprings of Islamic ethics, their application involves complex interpretive traditions that have evolved over fourteen centuries of Muslim intellectual history. The interrelationship between textual authority, rational deliberation, and moral intuition creates a dynamic ethical system capable of addressing both enduring human concerns and emerging moral challenges.
