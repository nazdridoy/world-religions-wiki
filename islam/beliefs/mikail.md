# Mika'il (ميكائيل)

![Artistic representation of the angel Mika'il (note: Islam generally avoids depicting angels)](mikail.jpg)

Mika'il (also spelled Mikail or Michael) is one of the major archangels in Islamic theology, holding a position of great prominence among the celestial hierarchy. As one of the four principal angels frequently mentioned in Islamic tradition, Mika'il is primarily responsible for administering divine providence in nature, particularly controlling rainfall, plant growth, and sustaining life on earth. Unlike human beings, Mika'il is a being created from light who unfailingly carries out Allah's commands without question or hesitation, embodying perfect submission to divine will.

## Etymology and Names

The name Mika'il (ميكائيل) has several variations in pronunciation and spelling throughout Islamic literature:

1. **Mika'il** - The most common transcription in classical Arabic texts
2. **Mikail** - A simplified modern spelling
3. **Mikal** - Another variation found in some texts
4. **Michael** - The Anglicized equivalent recognized across Abrahamic traditions

The name consists of two components with theological significance:
1. **Mika** - Derived from a root meaning "who is like" or "resembling"
2. **Il** - Referring to Allah or God

Together, the name carries the implied meaning "Who is like Allah?" - a rhetorical question emphasizing that no being can be compared to Allah, affirming divine uniqueness.

In Islamic tradition, Mika'il is also known by several descriptive titles:

- **Malak al-Amtar** (Angel of Rain)
- **Malak al-Rizq** (Angel of Provision)
- **Mudabbir al-Qitar** (Administrator of Rainfall)
- **Sayyid al-Mala'ikah** (A Leader of Angels)
- **Wazir al-Ra'aq** (Minister of Sustenance)

## Quranic Foundation

Mika'il is explicitly mentioned by name only once in the Quran, though his role is understood through tradition:

> "Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers." (Quran 2:98)

The pairing with Jibril (Gabriel) in this verse indicates Mika'il's high status, as both angels are specifically named together as beings deserving of respect and acceptance.

While this is the only explicit mention by name, Islamic scholars have identified several other Quranic verses that allude to Mika'il's function:

> "It is Allah who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds, and He spreads them in the sky however He wills, and He makes them fragments so you see the rain emerge from within them." (Quran 30:48)

This verse, while not mentioning Mika'il directly, describes the process of rainfall that Islamic tradition attributes to his administration.

> "And We have sent down blessed rain from the sky and made grow thereby gardens and grain from the harvest." (Quran 50:9)

Again, this divine action of sending rain is understood to be administered through Mika'il's angelical service.

> "And from the sky, He sends down rain and brings to life thereby the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed in that are signs for a people who listen." (Quran 30:24)

Exegetical tradition associates this life-giving rain with Mika'il's responsibilities.

## Creation and Status

According to Islamic tradition, Mika'il belongs to the most elite class of angels described as "al-Muqarrabun" (those brought near to Allah). This highest rank of angels includes the four archangels:

1. **Jibril** - Responsible for revelation and spiritual guidance
2. **Mika'il** - In charge of provision and natural phenomena
3. **Israfil** - Will blow the trumpet on Judgment Day
4. **Azrael** - The Angel of Death who takes souls

Among these four, Jibril and Mika'il are often mentioned together and are considered the most prominent. They represent the two fundamental aspects of divine mercy: spiritual guidance (Jibril) and physical sustenance (Mika'il).

Like all angels, Mika'il was created from celestial light (nur) before the creation of humans. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ described angels as having been created from light, while jinn were created from smokeless fire, and humans from clay.

Islamic tradition states that when Mika'il was first created, his initial act was one of worship, prostrating before Allah in perfect submission. This established his eternal nature as a servant completely devoted to divine will.

## Attributes and Characteristics

According to Islamic tradition, Mika'il possesses several distinctive attributes:

### Physical Description

* Created from celestial light (nur)
* Described in some traditions as possessing magnificent wings
* Has a beautiful and awe-inspiring appearance
* Size and form beyond human comprehension
* Capable of assuming different forms when necessary

Some traditions elaborate on his physical appearance with greater detail:

* Possesses multiple pairs of wings (some traditions suggest thousands)
* Each wing adorned with countless jewel-like colors reflecting divine light
* Body composed entirely of celestial light with varying intensities
* Eyes that contain galaxies of stars (metaphorical description)
* When manifesting in the earthly realm, capable of appearing as precipitation or other natural elements

### Status and Rank

* One of the four archangels closest to Allah
* Present in the divine presence, in proximity to Allah's throne
* Mentioned alongside Jibril as deserving particular reverence
* Subject of prayers and supplications by believers
* Counted among the angels who prostrated to Adam at creation

Imam Al-Qurtubi mentions in his exegesis that Mika'il holds special rank due to the essential nature of his duties. While Jibril's revelatory function was completed with the final revelation to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, Mika'il's role in sustaining creation through rain and provision continues until the end of time, making his service perpetually active.

According to Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), Mika'il stands at a position near Allah's throne, with countless subordinate angels under his command who assist in administering rainfall, plant growth, and the distribution of provision to all creatures.

### Character and Nature

* Complete obedience to divine commands
* Freedom from sin, desire, or rebellion
* Neither eats nor drinks
* Does not experience fatigue
* Possesses no free will to disobey Allah
* Exists solely to fulfill divine mandate

Additionally, traditions describe Mika'il as having these character qualities:

* Compassionate toward believers, as he recognizes how their sustenance depends on his faithful execution of duties
* Precise in measuring and distributing provisions according to divine decree
* Understanding the interconnectedness of all natural systems
* Extraordinary patience in maintaining natural cycles over millennia
* Deep sadness when humans waste or abuse the provisions he delivers

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Administrator of Nature

* Controls and distributes rainfall according to divine decree
* Supervises plant growth and agricultural fertility
* Determines where and when rain will fall
* Commands winds and weather patterns
* Ensures the provisioning of all creatures

Ibn Kathir elaborated that Mika'il does not act independently but follows Allah's commands with perfect precision. Each droplet of rain is released only as specifically decreed, with exact measurements for each location on earth. Nothing in his administration is random or accidental; rather, all follows divine wisdom.

Al-Suyuti reported that Mika'il commands massive ranks of angels who assist with different aspects of natural phenomena:
1. Angels who arrange cloud formations
2. Angels who measure exact rainfall quantities
3. Angels who direct winds to specific locations
4. Angels who oversee the growth of specific plant types
5. Angels who protect certain crops from disease and pests

### Specific Natural Phenomena Under Mika'il's Administration

1. **Rainfall Cycle**
   * Evaporation from oceans and water bodies
   * Cloud formation and development
   * Precipitation in various forms (rain, snow, hail)
   * Distribution according to divine wisdom

2. **Agricultural Development**
   * Germination of seeds
   * Growth of crops
   * Ripening of fruits
   * Cycling of seasons

3. **Ocean and Water Systems**
   * Tides and currents
   * Underwater ecosystems
   * Distribution of marine resources
   * Purification of water

4. **Wind Patterns**
   * Seasonal shifts in weather
   * Distribution of pollen
   * Seed dispersal
   * Prevention of stagnant air

### Cosmological Function

* Maintains natural balance in creation
* Oversees seasonal changes
* Mediates between divine will and natural phenomena
* Works in concert with numerous subordinate angels
* Participates in the cosmic ordering of creation

In the words of Ibn Arabi, the famous Sufi scholar, Mika'il's cosmic function extends beyond Earth to include the movement of celestial bodies that influence weather patterns. The moon's pull on tides, the sun's role in evaporation, and the stars' positions that ancient farmers used for agricultural timing all fall under his broader administrative domain.

Some traditions suggest that Mika'il's jurisdiction extends to other planets and celestial bodies, maintaining their atmospheres and any provision needed for whatever life forms Allah may have created there, known only to Him.

### Relationship to Divine Decree (Qadar)

Mika'il's administration of natural phenomena powerfully illustrates the Islamic concept of divine decree (qadar). Through him, we see how Allah has established both:

1. **Fixed natural laws** - The consistent patterns of rainfall, seasons, and growth
2. **Specific divine interventions** - Particular instances of abundance or withholding

This balance demonstrates the Islamic understanding that Allah works both through established natural laws and specific interventions, with angelic administrators like Mika'il faithfully executing both.

### Connection to Human Sustenance

The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is reported to have said: "Every morning two angels descend. One of them says, 'O Allah, give the person who spends in charity compensation.' The other says, 'O Allah, give the person who withholds destruction.'" Some scholars have suggested that Mika'il is connected to the angel who prays for the charitable person, as provision and charity are interlinked.

According to some narrations, Mika'il keeps special records of those who:
1. Express gratitude for Allah's provisions
2. Share their resources generously
3. Avoid waste and excess
4. Recognize the divine source of all sustenance

### Eschatological Role

* Will be present on Judgment Day
* Stands among the angels surrounding Allah's throne
* Some traditions suggest a role in the weighing of deeds
* Continues administrative functions in the afterlife
* Assists in the transformation of creation at world's end

More specifically about his end-times functions:

1. **During the Blowing of the Trumpet**
   When Israfil blows the trumpet signaling the end of the world, Mika'il will cease all rainfall and natural growth processes, contributing to the cessation of worldly life.

2. **During the Period Between the Blowings**
   All creation, including Mika'il, will temporarily cease existence.

3. **After Resurrection**
   Mika'il will assist in the establishment of the gathering place (mahshar) by leveling the earth and preparing it for the assembly of all souls.

4. **During Judgment**
   Standing near Allah's throne with other archangels, witnessing the judgment of humanity.

5. **In Paradise**
   According to some interpretations, Mika'il continues an administrative role in Paradise, overseeing the rivers of milk and honey, and the perfect fruits and provisions promised to believers.

## Interactions with Prophets

Unlike Jibril, who frequently delivered messages directly to prophets, Mika'il's interactions with prophets were generally less direct, primarily involving natural phenomena that aided prophets in their missions. However, Islamic traditions do record some specific interactions:

### With Adam (Adam)

* Instructed Adam about agriculture after his descent to Earth
* Taught humanity, through Adam, how to recognize signs of coming rainfall
* Showed Adam how to plant seeds and cultivate crops
* Delivered the first rainfall to Earth after Adam's creation

### With Nuh (Noah)

* Directed the great flood waters during the time of Nuh
* According to some traditions, taught Nuh how to build the Ark
* Controlled the timing and intensity of the flood waters
* Stopped the rainfall when divine judgment was complete

### With Ibrahim (Abraham)

* Some traditions suggest Mika'il was present alongside Jibril when visiting Ibrahim
* When Ibrahim was thrown into the fire, some accounts suggest Mika'il was assigned to control the element of water that could have extinguished the fire, but Allah directly commanded the fire to be cool and safe
* Later blessed the land around Ibrahim's settlement with fertile soil and abundant rainfall
* According to some narratives, Mika'il assisted Jibril in creating the well of Zamzam, with Jibril striking the ground and Mika'il ensuring its continued flow

### With Yusuf (Joseph)

* During the seven years of abundant harvest prophesied by Yusuf, Mika'il oversaw the bountiful production
* Similarly, during the seven lean years, Mika'il withheld rain according to divine decree
* Helped preserve Egypt's limited resources during the famine through subtle guidance of weather patterns

### With Musa (Moses)

* Involved in delivering the plagues upon Egypt, particularly those involving natural elements like hail
* Controlled the parting and returning of the Red Sea waters
* Delivered manna and quails as sustenance for the Israelites in the wilderness
* Provided water from rocks when struck by Musa's staff

### With Sulaiman (Solomon)

* Assisted in Sulaiman's control over natural elements
* Helped regulate the winds that Sulaiman commanded
* Ensured abundant rainfall over Sulaiman's kingdom, contributing to its prosperity

### With Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

* According to authentic narrations, Mika'il was often positioned at the Prophet's left side during prayer, while Jibril stood at his right
* During the Battle of Badr, Mika'il was present among the angelic forces supporting the Muslims
* Brought rainfall to assist the Muslim army at critical moments in various battles
* When the Muslims performed the prayer for rain (Salat al-Istisqa), Mika'il would respond to the Prophet's supplications

A particularly significant interaction occurred during the Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj), when the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ saw both Jibril and Mika'il. According to narrations, when the Prophet was offered vessels of milk, water, and wine, his choice of milk was approved by Mika'il, who said, "You have chosen the natural state (fitrah)," highlighting Mika'il's connection to natural sustenance and the original nature of creation.

## In Islamic Tradition

### Hadith References

Several hadith (recorded sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad) mention Mika'il:

* In Sahih Muslim, the Prophet is reported to have said during night prayer: "O Allah, Lord of Jibril, Mika'il, and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and the earth..."

* Another tradition states that Jibril stands at the Prophet's right side and Mika'il at his left during prayer

* Some narrations suggest that while Jibril brought revelation and guidance, Mika'il brought fertility and provision

Additional authentic hadith references include:

* "The Prophet ﷺ used to say when startled: 'There is no god but Allah,' and when he stood for prayer, he would say: 'Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise; blessed is Your name, exalted is Your majesty, and there is no god other than You. I seek refuge in Allah, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, from the accursed Satan: from his madness, his arrogance, and his poetry.' Then he would say: 'O Allah, Lord of Jibril, Mika'il, and Israfil.'" (Abu Dawud)

* When asked about the creation of angels, the Prophet ﷺ said: "The angels were created from light, just as the jinn were created from smokeless fire and humans were created from what has been described to you." (Sahih Muslim) This applies to all angels including Mika'il.

* The Prophet ﷺ said: "When Allah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His statement, like a chain on a smooth stone. When fear is banished from their hearts, they say, 'What has your Lord said?' They say, 'The truth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.' Then Jibril and Mika'il are among the first to raise their heads, and Allah tells them what He wills of His decree." (Al-Bukhari)

### Interpretive Traditions

Islamic scholars developed various understandings of Mika'il's nature and function:

* Al-Qurtubi described him as the angel of mercy, bringing beneficial rain and sustenance
* Ibn Kathir noted his special relationship to the believing community
* Some Sufi interpretations saw him as representing divine providence and sustenance
* Theological traditions emphasized his perfect submission as a model for believers
* Folk traditions sometimes invoked Mika'il for relief during drought or famine

Al-Ghazali, the renowned Islamic scholar, elaborated on Mika'il's symbolic significance in his "Ihya Ulum al-Din" (Revival of Religious Sciences), viewing him as representing the aspect of divine mercy that sustains physical existence, while Jibril represents the mercy that sustains spiritual existence.

Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya suggested that Mika'il's control over provision symbolizes how Allah tests humans both with abundance and scarcity, each being a different form of divine trial requiring patience and gratitude.

### Specific Supplications Mentioning Mika'il

Several authentic supplications mentioning Mika'il have been preserved:

1. The opening supplication of night prayer:
"O Allah, Lord of Jibril, Mika'il, and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen. You judge between Your servants concerning that wherein they differ. Guide me to the truth in that wherein they differ, by Your permission. Indeed, You guide whom You will to a straight path."

2. Supplication during rainfall:
"O Allah, let it be a beneficial rain cloud." (Al-Bukhari)
This supplication recognizes Mika'il's role in administering rainfall.

3. Supplication during drought:
"O Allah, give us rain, O Allah, give us rain, O Allah, give us rain." (Al-Bukhari)
While not explicitly mentioning Mika'il, this supplication is understood to invoke his function.

## Historical Weather Events Associated with Mika'il

Throughout Islamic history, certain noteworthy weather events have been traditionally associated with Mika'il's direct intervention:

1. **The Year of the Elephant (570 CE)** - The year of the Prophet's birth, when Abraha's army was destroyed by birds dropping stones, was also marked by particularly abundant rainfall across Arabia, viewed as a divine blessing coinciding with Muhammad's ﷺ birth.

2. **The Battle of Badr (624 CE)** - Rainfall before the battle firmed the ground under the Muslims' feet while creating muddy conditions that hampered their opponents. This was seen as Mika'il's direct assistance.

3. **The Drought of Madinah (632 CE)** - When a severe drought afflicted Madinah, the Prophet ﷺ performed the special prayer for rain (Istisqa), and rain came immediately afterward.

4. **The Battle of the Trench (627 CE)** - Strong winds that contributed to driving away the confederate forces were attributed to angelic intervention, particularly Mika'il's command over winds.

## Comparative Perspectives

### Abrahamic Traditions

Mika'il's role in Islam has parallels with his depiction in other Abrahamic faiths:

* In Judaism, Michael is considered Israel's guardian angel and defender
* In Christianity, Michael appears as a warrior angel and leader of heavenly hosts
* Islamic tradition emphasizes Mika'il's provisional role more than his martial aspects
* All three traditions recognize him as a principal angel close to God
* His connection to natural phenomena is most developed in Islamic tradition

More detailed comparisons reveal:

1. **In Judaism**:
   * Michael (Hebrew: מיכאל, meaning "Who is like God?") is one of the chief princes and guardian of Israel
   * Described as a warrior figure who battles spiritual forces opposing the Children of Israel
   * Appears in the Book of Daniel as a protector
   * Later Jewish mystical traditions associate him with mercy and the element of water

2. **In Christianity**:
   * Depicted as the leader of God's armies against Satan's forces in the Book of Revelation
   * Often portrayed with a sword and scales of justice
   * Designated as a saint in Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican traditions
   * Sometimes associated with healing waters and springs

3. **Unique Islamic Emphasis**:
   * Islam uniquely emphasizes Mika'il's role in natural provision and rainfall
   * Presents a more administrative rather than warrior characterization
   * Focuses on his continued active role in daily sustenance rather than primarily eschatological functions
   * Associates him directly with agricultural fertility and food security

### Cultural Representations

* Persian miniature paintings occasionally depicted angels (though without claiming accuracy)
* Turkish and Indian Muslim artistic traditions sometimes symbolically represented angels
* Contemporary Muslim popular culture includes stylized references to major angels
* Modern Muslim children's literature often includes descriptions of Mika'il's duties
* Religious education materials typically describe his functions without visual depiction

In particular regions, cultural representations have taken distinctive forms:

1. **Persian Tradition**: In some Persian miniatures from the medieval period, natural phenomena like rain and growth are depicted with subtle angelic forms in clouds, symbolically representing Mika'il's function while avoiding direct representation.

2. **Turkish Tradition**: Ottoman calligraphic traditions sometimes incorporated Mika'il's name into artistic designs, particularly in agricultural contexts or on buildings related to water management.

3. **South Asian Tradition**: In Indian and Pakistani Muslim folk art, stylized motifs of rainfall and growing plants sometimes include calligraphic elements from Mika'il's name.

4. **Indonesian Tradition**: In world's largest Muslim population, shadow puppet traditions sometimes include references to the "rain angel" in agricultural contexts.

## Theological Significance

### Divine Providence

Mika'il's role illustrates several theological concepts:

* Allah's continual involvement in sustaining creation
* The structured hierarchy of the unseen world
* Divine mercy manifested through natural provision
* The use of angelic intermediaries in cosmic governance
* The perfect implementation of divine will through obedient servants

Imam Al-Ghazali elaborated on how Mika'il demonstrates the concept of "Rizq" (divine provision) in his work "The Revival of Religious Sciences." He explained that all sustenance comes ultimately from Allah, with Mika'il serving as the administrator rather than the source. This distinction is crucial for maintaining Islamic monotheism (tawhid) while acknowledging angelic functions.

According to Ibn Taymiyyah, Mika'il's role shows that Allah governs the universe through a system of secondary causes that includes angelic administrators, yet Allah remains the primary cause behind all phenomena. This resolves the apparent tension between divine sovereignty and natural causality.

### Ethical Implications

Belief in Mika'il reinforces specific Islamic values:

* Gratitude for natural provisions as divine gifts
* Recognition of natural phenomena as divinely orchestrated
* Accountability for how environmental resources are used
* Awareness of unseen forces working in the visible world
* Appreciation for cosmic harmony and balance

Additionally, recognizing Mika'il's role encourages:

1. **Environmental Stewardship**: Understanding that natural resources are divinely administered encourages responsible use and conservation.

2. **Gratitude Practice**: Recognizing the angelic administration behind daily provision promotes constant thankfulness.

3. **Moderation in Consumption**: Awareness that each provision is specifically measured and allocated encourages avoiding excess and waste.

4. **Agricultural Ethics**: Traditional Islamic farming practices often included recognition of Mika'il through prayers at planting and harvest.

5. **Water Conservation**: Islamic traditions emphasizing Mika'il's careful measurement of each raindrop have inspired water conservation ethics throughout Muslim history.

## Contemporary Relevance

* Provides theological framework for Islamic environmental ethics
* Offers spiritual dimension to understanding natural disasters and climate
* Symbolizes divine care for creation's sustenance and nourishment
* Reminds believers that rainfall and fertility are manifestations of divine mercy
* Connects daily sustenance with theological understanding of divine providence

### Modern Applications of Mika'il's Theological Significance

1. **Islamic Environmental Movements**:
   Several contemporary Islamic environmental organizations draw inspiration from the concept of angelic administration of nature, particularly Mika'il's role. These include the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences (IFEES) and the Muslim Association for Climate Change Action (MACCA).

2. **Agricultural Development**:
   Some Muslim-majority countries have incorporated traditional understandings of provision and rainfall into modern agricultural development programs, emphasizing both technical advancement and spiritual appreciation.

3. **Water Conservation Campaigns**:
   In water-scarce regions like the Middle East and North Africa, religious messaging about the sacred nature of water often references Mika'il's careful administration of this resource.

4. **Natural Disaster Response**:
   Islamic relief organizations sometimes incorporate spiritual dimensions related to Mika'il's role when responding to droughts, floods, and other natural disasters, balancing practical aid with spiritual consolation.

5. **Climate Change Discourse**:
   Some Muslim scholars have developed theological responses to climate change that reference Mika'il's role in maintaining natural balance, arguing that human disruption of climate systems interferes with divinely established natural order.

### Mika'il in Muslim Spirituality Today

Contemporary Muslim spiritual practices relating to Mika'il include:

1. **Rain Prayers** (Salat al-Istisqa): Still performed during droughts in many Muslim communities.

2. **Gratitude Rituals**: Many Muslims say "Alhamdulillah" (praise be to Allah) before meals, recognizing the divine source of provision administered through Mika'il.

3. **Environmental Consciousness**: Growing awareness of environmental issues has led to renewed interest in Islamic concepts of natural harmony, including Mika'il's role.

4. **Agricultural Supplications**: Traditional farmers in Muslim regions often continue practices of supplication during planting and harvesting that reference divine provision.

5. **Educational Programs**: Islamic schools increasingly incorporate teachings about angelic roles in nature to develop environmental consciousness in Muslim youth.
