Mika'il (also spelled Mikail or Michael) is one of the major archangels in Islamic theology, holding a position of great prominence among the celestial hierarchy. As one of the four principal angels frequently mentioned in Islamic tradition, Mika'il is primarily responsible for administering divine providence in nature, particularly controlling rainfall, plant growth, and sustaining life on earth. Unlike human beings, Mika'il is a being created from light who unfailingly carries out Allah's commands without question or hesitation, embodying perfect submission to divine will.

## Quranic Foundation

Mika'il is explicitly mentioned by name only once in the Quran, though his role is understood through tradition:

> "Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers." (Quran 2:98)

The pairing with Jibril (Gabriel) in this verse indicates Mika'il's high status, as both angels are specifically named together as beings deserving of respect and acceptance.
