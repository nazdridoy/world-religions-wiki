# Jinn (الجن)

![Artistic representation of the unseen realm of jinn](jinn.jpg)

Jinn are a distinct class of sentient beings in Islamic theology, created by Allah from "smokeless fire" (Quran 55:15), just as humans were created from clay and angels from light. Occupying an ontological position between humans and angels, jinn are typically invisible to human sight, possess free will, and like humans, can be righteous or wicked, believers or disbelievers. Neither demons nor spirits in the Western sense, jinn represent a unique category of creation within Islamic cosmology that interacts with the human world while remaining largely unseen. Their existence forms an integral part of the Islamic worldview and understanding of the unseen realm.

## Quranic Foundation
