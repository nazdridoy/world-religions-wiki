# Social Ethics (الأخلاق الاجتماعية)

![Muslim community engaged in social service work](social_ethics.jpg)

Social ethics in Islam encompasses the moral principles, values, and guidelines that govern interpersonal relationships, communal responsibilities, and societal structures. Derived from the Quran, prophetic traditions (Sunnah), and subsequent Islamic scholarship, Islamic social ethics aims to establish a just, compassionate, and morally upright society where individuals fulfill their obligations to one another and to the community as a whole. These ethical principles extend beyond individual piety to address systemic issues of justice, welfare, mutual care, and collective responsibility. Islamic social ethics balances rights with responsibilities, individual freedom with communal welfare, and material development with spiritual values, offering a comprehensive framework for ethical social engagement in both Muslim-majority and pluralistic contexts.

## Quranic Foundations

The Quran establishes fundamental principles for social ethics through numerous verses:

> "O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even if it be against yourselves, your parents, or your relatives, whether rich or poor." (Quran 4:135)

> "And do good as Allah has done good to you. And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters." (Quran 28:77)

> "And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided." (Quran 3:103)

> "The believers are but brothers, so make settlement between your brothers. And fear Allah that you may receive mercy." (Quran 49:10)

> "And [they are] those who, when they spend, do so not excessively or sparingly but are ever, between that, [maintaining] a moderate way." (Quran 25:67)

These and other verses establish several foundational ethical principles:
* Justice ('adl) as a supreme value
* Community solidarity and cohesion
* Mutual responsibility and care
* Moderation and balance
* Integrity in public and private life
* Moral accountability before God
