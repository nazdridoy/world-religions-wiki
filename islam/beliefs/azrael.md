Azrael (also known as Malak al-Mawt or the Angel of Death) is the angel responsible for separating souls from bodies at the time of death in Islamic tradition. Although the name "Azrael" does not appear in the Quran, the concept of an angel of death is firmly established in Islamic scripture, and traditional sources have identified this figure as Azrael. As with all angels in Islam, Azrael is created from light, acts in perfect submission to Allah's will, and carries out his duties precisely as commanded, serving as the divine instrument for the transition of souls from earthly existence to the afterlife.

## Quranic Foundation

While the name Azrael is not mentioned in the Quran, the angel of death is explicitly referenced:

> "Say, 'The angel of death (Malak al-Mawt) who has been entrusted with you will take your soul; then to your Lord you will be returned.'" (Quran 32:11)

Other verses allude to angels who take souls at death:

> "He is the Subjugator over His servants, and He sends over you guardian-angels until, when death comes to one of you, Our messengers [angels] take him, and they do not fail [in their duties]." (Quran 6:61)

> "Those whom the angels take [in death] while they are in a state of purity, they [angels] say, 'Peace be upon you. Enter Paradise for what you used to do.'" (Quran 16:32)

These verses establish the Islamic belief in angels responsible for taking souls at death, which tradition has associated with Azrael.

## In Islamic Tradition

### Hadith References

While fewer authentic hadith mention Azrael by name compared to other archangels, numerous traditions describe the angel of death:

* The Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said that the soul of the believer comes out easily, while that of the disbeliever is drawn out roughly

Several notable narratives about Azrael appear in Islamic literature:
