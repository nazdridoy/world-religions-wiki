# Azrael (عزرائيل)

![Symbolic representation of the angel of death (note: Islam generally avoids depicting angels)](azrael.jpg)

Azrael (also known as Malak al-Mawt or the Angel of Death) is the angel responsible for separating souls from bodies at the time of death in Islamic tradition. Although the name "Azrael" does not appear in the Quran, the concept of an angel of death is firmly established in Islamic scripture, and traditional sources have identified this figure as Azrael. As with all angels in Islam, Azrael is created from light, acts in perfect submission to Allah's will, and carries out his duties precisely as commanded, serving as the divine instrument for the transition of souls from earthly existence to the afterlife.

## Etymology and Names

The name "Azrael" (عزرائيل) is derived from the Arabic word "azara" meaning "to help" combined with the suffix "el" which refers to Allah or God. Thus, the name can be interpreted as "Help of Allah" or "One whom Allah helps." This etymology reflects his divinely appointed function in helping souls transition from earthly life to the afterlife.

In Islamic tradition, Azrael is known by several names and titles:

1. **Malak al-Mawt** (ملك الموت) - "Angel of Death," the most common Quranic reference
2. **Qabid al-Arwah** (قابض الارواح) - "Seizer of Souls"
3. **Hâdim al-Ladhdhât** (هادم اللذات) - "Destroyer of Delights"
4. **Mufriq al-Jama'at** (مفرق الجماعات) - "Separator of Communities/Gatherings"
5. **Izra'il/Izrail** (إزرائيل) - A variant pronunciation common in some regions

While the specific name "Azrael" does not appear in the Quran, it became widely accepted in Islamic tradition and literature. The Quran consistently refers to him functionally as the "Angel of Death" (Malak al-Mawt), emphasizing his role rather than a personal name.

## Quranic Foundation

While the name Azrael is not mentioned in the Quran, the angel of death is explicitly referenced:

> "Say, 'The angel of death (Malak al-Mawt) who has been entrusted with you will take your soul; then to your Lord you will be returned.'" (Quran 32:11)

Other verses allude to angels who take souls at death:

> "He is the Subjugator over His servants, and He sends over you guardian-angels until, when death comes to one of you, Our messengers [angels] take him, and they do not fail [in their duties]." (Quran 6:61)

> "Those whom the angels take [in death] while they are in a state of purity, they [angels] say, 'Peace be upon you. Enter Paradise for what you used to do.'" (Quran 16:32)

Additional Quranic references that relate to Azrael's function include:

> "When death approaches one of you, Our messengers take his soul, and they never fail in their duty." (Quran 6:61)

> "How [will it be] when the angels take them in death, striking their faces and their backs?" (Quran 47:27)

> "If you could see, when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death while the angels extend their hands, [saying], 'Discharge your souls!'" (Quran 6:93)

These verses establish the Islamic belief in angels responsible for taking souls at death, which tradition has associated with Azrael.

## Attributes and Characteristics

According to Islamic tradition, Azrael possesses several distinctive attributes:

### Physical Description

- Created from divine light (nur)
- Described with multiple eyes and tongues corresponding to all living beings
- In some traditions, portrayed with immense size and majestic appearance
- Often symbolically depicted with a scroll or book recording the appointed times of death
- Unlike human depictions of "death" as a skeleton or fearsome figure, Islamic tradition emphasizes his role as a dignified messenger
- Capable of appearing in different forms depending on the spiritual state of the dying person

Traditional Islamic sources describe Azrael as having extraordinary physical features that reflect his cosmic responsibilities:

- **Multiple Eyes** - Some narrations suggest he has as many eyes as there are living beings in creation. When a person's appointed time arrives, the corresponding eye closes.
- **Wings** - Tradition describes him with powerful wings that can span between the east and west.
- **Book of Life and Death** - Often depicted holding a divine register containing the lifespan of every creature.
- **Immense Size** - Like other archangels, his true form is described as majestic and awe-inspiring, far larger than human comprehension.
- **Transformative Appearance** - Able to manifest in different forms; appearing beautiful and peaceful to the righteous, but terrifying to the sinful.

A narration from Ka'b al-Ahbar describes: "The distance between his eyes is equivalent to a journey of 70,000 days, and he has as many faces as there are people in the world. When a person's time comes, the face corresponding to that person becomes illuminated, and Azrael knows it is time to seize that particular soul."

### Status and Rank

- One of the four principal archangels in Islamic angelology
- Designated with the specific task of separating souls from bodies
- Acts directly under divine command with absolute precision
- Often mentioned alongside Jibril, Mika'il, and Israfil
- Possesses knowledge of when each soul is scheduled to be taken
- Cannot delay or hasten death beyond the divinely appointed time

In the hierarchy of angels, Islamic tradition places Azrael among the highest rank of angels known as the "Muqarrabun" (those brought near to Allah). He is considered one of the four major archangels, with specific references in multiple hadith collections identifying these four as:

1. **Jibril** (Gabriel) - The angel of revelation
2. **Mika'il** (Michael) - The angel of provision and natural phenomena
3. **Israfil** - The angel who will blow the trumpet on Judgment Day
4. **Azrael** - The angel of death

He occupies a unique position of responsibility, as death touches every living being without exception. As the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: "Remember often the destroyer of pleasures [death]." This universal role gives Azrael a position of great significance in the divine order.

### Character and Nature

- Perfect submission to Allah's will
- Unwavering obedience in carrying out divine decrees
- Neither cruel nor merciful of his own accord
- Performs his function without personal emotion or bias
- Operates with absolute precision and timeliness
- Manifests differently to the righteous and the sinful at death

Unlike popular depictions in some cultures that portray death as evil or frightening, Islamic tradition emphasizes that Azrael is neither cruel nor vindictive but simply fulfills his appointed duty with perfect obedience. He does not decide when someone will die—that is Allah's decree alone. Azrael merely acts as the instrument of this divine will.

## Creation and Cosmic Role

According to Islamic tradition, Azrael was created with specific attributes suited to his monumental task:

- **First Encounter with Death** - When Allah created death and life, He summoned Azrael and entrusted him with the responsibility of separating souls from bodies.
- **Universal Awareness** - He was given knowledge of all creatures and their appointed times.
- **Perfect Record** - In some traditions, he maintains the Book of Life and Death, which contains the exact lifespan of every living being.
- **Divine Protection** - Despite witnessing immense suffering and grief, he was granted special strength to carry out his duties without being affected by human emotion.

A famous narration describes that when Allah first created Azrael and appointed him as the Angel of Death, He showed him the magnitude of his task. Azrael asked, "How will I be able to take the souls of all creatures, when some may be in the east while others are in the west?" Allah then granted him special powers to reach any soul at its appointed time, regardless of where it might be.

## Functions and Responsibilities

### Primary Role: Taking of Souls

- Separates the soul from the body at the moment of decreed death
- Arrives at precisely the appointed time, neither early nor late
- Recognizes each individual soul among all creation
- Acts as a transition agent between earthly life and the afterlife
- Treats souls according to their spiritual state and divine instruction
- In some traditions, personally presents souls before Allah for preliminary judgment

### Process of Death

Islamic tradition describes the process through which Azrael operates:

- Arrives at the predetermined moment known only to Allah
- For believers, appears in a beautiful, comforting form
- For disbelievers, may appear in a terrifying aspect
- Extracts the soul with varying degrees of ease based on the person's spiritual state
- Righteous souls are removed gently "like a drop of water from a waterskin"
- Souls of the wicked may be extracted with greater difficulty
- Delivers the soul to other angels who escort it to its interim destination

When Azrael arrives to take a soul, he is accompanied by assistant angels. For the righteous, these angels bring shrouds and perfumes from Paradise. For the wicked, they bring harsh materials from Hellfire. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ described how believers experience death: "When a believer is about to depart from this world, angels with faces as bright as the sun descend... Then the Angel of Death comes and sits at his head and says, 'O good soul, come out to forgiveness and pleasure from Allah!'" (Ahmad)

The contrasting experience for the unrighteous is also described in traditions: "When an unbeliever is about to depart from this world, stern and harsh angels descend... Then the Angel of Death comes and sits at his head and says, 'O evil soul, come out to the wrath and anger of Allah.'" 

### The Soul's Journey After Death

Once Azrael has taken the soul, his assistants take over:

- **For Believers** - The soul is passed to angels who carry it upward through the heavens
- **For Disbelievers** - The soul is handed to angels who direct it toward its interim punishment
- **Recording of Deeds** - The soul is presented with its book of deeds
- **Questioning in the Grave** - The angels Munkar and Nakir arrive to question the deceased

According to tradition, after taking the soul, Azrael does not linger but moves on to his next appointed task, as deaths occur continuously throughout creation.

### Cosmological Significance

Beyond individual deaths, tradition attributes broader significance to Azrael:

- Maintains the balance between life and death in creation
- Participates in the divine system of accountability
- Serves as a reminder of mortality and ultimate return to Allah
- Will take the souls of all creation at the end of the world
- Will himself die at Allah's command after all other beings

At the end of time, Azrael will take the souls of all remaining creatures, including the other angels. Finally, Allah will command him to take his own soul, leaving only Allah the Eternal. As the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ described: "Allah will fold up the heavens on the Day of Resurrection and then take them in His right hand. Then He will say, 'I am the King! Where are the tyrants? Where are the arrogant ones?'" (Bukhari)

## Key Encounters with Prophets and Notable Figures

Islamic tradition records several significant encounters between Azrael and various prophets and notable figures:

### Adam (Adam)

- When Adam was created, all the angels including Azrael were commanded to prostrate to him
- After Adam's fall from Paradise, Azrael became the means by which his descendants would return to dust
- Adam was the first human to experience natural death, with Azrael taking his soul as a model for all who would follow

### Ibrahim (Abraham)

- According to tradition, when Ibrahim's appointed time came, Azrael appeared to him in the form of an elderly man
- Ibrahim asked, "How would a decrepit old man like you want to take the soul of Ibrahim, the Friend of Allah?"
- Azrael replied, "I appear to people in a form corresponding to their deeds and spiritual state"
- Ibrahim then accepted his time had come and submitted willingly

### Musa (Moses)

The most famous narrative concerning Azrael involves his encounter with Prophet Musa:

- Azrael came to Musa in human form to take his soul
- Not recognizing him, Musa asked who he was and when told he was the Angel of Death, Musa struck him
- Azrael returned to Allah who restored his eye (that Musa had struck out)
- Allah then asked Musa how he wished to die, telling him to place his hand on a bull and he would live for as many years as hairs his hand covered
- Musa asked what would happen after that, and when told he would die, Musa said, "Then let it be now" and asked only to die close to the Holy Land

This story illustrates the natural human resistance to death, yet the ultimate acceptance of divine decree even by one of Allah's greatest prophets.

### Sulaiman (Solomon)

Another famous narrative involves Sulaiman:

- One day, while Sulaiman was sitting on his throne, a stranger entered his court without permission
- When questioned, the stranger identified himself as Azrael
- A man in Sulaiman's court noticed Azrael looking at him intently and grew frightened
- The man asked Sulaiman to command the wind to carry him to the distant land of India to escape
- After the man departed, Sulaiman asked Azrael why he had stared at the man
- Azrael replied, "I was amazed to see this man here, as I was commanded to take his soul in India today"
- This illustrates that one cannot escape one's appointed time, regardless of the measures taken

### Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

The traditions surrounding the Prophet Muhammad's death are particularly poignant:

- When his time approached, Azrael sought permission before entering the Prophet's room
- Unlike with other humans, Azrael gave the Prophet ﷺ the choice whether to remain on earth or return to Allah
- The Prophet chose to meet his Lord, saying, "The highest companionship in Paradise"
- His last moments were gentle, as he dipped his hand in water and wiped his face, saying, "There is no god but Allah. Indeed, death has its agonies."

In one tradition, Aisha narrated that the Prophet ﷺ had a vessel of water next to him during his final illness. He would dip his hand into it and wipe his face saying, "La ilaha illallah (There is no god but Allah). Truly death has its agonies." Then he raised his hand and kept saying, "The highest companionship" until his soul was taken and his hand fell.

## Relationship with Other Angels

Azrael works in coordination with several other angels in the divine system:

### With Jibril (Gabriel)

- Jibril brings the revelation that gives guidance for life, while Azrael implements the divine decree of death
- Both serve as messengers between the divine and human realms, but with different purposes
- They represent the two sides of divine mercy—guidance in life and transition at death
- Both were present at significant moments in the lives of the prophets

### With Israfil

- Israfil will blow the trumpet for the destruction of the world and resurrection
- Azrael takes souls in the first death, while after Israfil's trumpet, all will be resurrected
- They represent different phases in Allah's plan for creation
- Azrael's work precedes the first trumpet blast, then resumes after the second blast

### With the Recording Angels

- While Kiraman Katibin (the noble scribes) record deeds during life, Azrael implements the end of the testing period
- The book of deeds sealed by death is presented during judgment
- Azrael's arrival signals the completion of one's opportunity for good deeds

### With Munkar and Nakir

- After Azrael takes the soul, Munkar and Nakir arrive to question the deceased
- They form part of the sequential process of the afterlife
- While Azrael is concerned with the transition, they are concerned with the initial judgment

## In Islamic Tradition

### Hadith References

While fewer authentic hadith mention Azrael by name compared to other archangels, numerous traditions describe the angel of death:

- The Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said that the soul of the believer comes out easily, while that of the disbeliever is drawn out roughly
- Traditions describe the angel of death as seeking permission from prophets before taking their souls
- Some narrations indicate that the angel of death comes with other angels who assist in the process

In a hadith narrated by Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib, the Prophet ﷺ gave a detailed description of how the Angel of Death approaches different souls:

"When a believer is about to leave this world, angels with white faces come down from heaven with a shroud and perfume from Paradise... Then the Angel of Death approaches and sits at his head saying, 'O pure soul, come out to Allah's forgiveness and pleasure.' The soul then flows out as easily as water flows from the mouth of a waterskin."

For the disbeliever, the Prophet ﷺ described a contrasting scenario: "When a disbeliever is about to leave this world, angels with black faces come down with sackcloth... Then the Angel of Death comes and says, 'O impure soul, come out to Allah's displeasure and wrath.' The soul then disperses in the body, and the Angel of Death draws it out as a skewer is pulled out of wet wool."

### Stories and Teachings

Several notable narratives about Azrael appear in Islamic literature:

#### Moses and the Angel of Death

- A famous tradition recounts Prophet Moses striking Azrael when he came to take his soul
- Allah restored Azrael's eye (which Moses had struck out) and gave Moses the choice of when to die
- The story illustrates human reluctance to face death and divine wisdom in its timing

#### Solomon and the Angel of Death

- A tradition describes how Azrael looked intently at a man in Solomon's court
- The man asked Solomon to command the wind to carry him to India to escape
- When Azrael later met Solomon, he explained he was surprised to see the man because he was scheduled to take his soul in India

### Mystical Interpretations

Sufi and mystical traditions have developed additional understandings:

- The moment of death as the lover's reunion with the Beloved (Allah)
- Azrael as the usher to divine presence rather than merely an end to life
- Death as a veil lifted between the temporal and eternal worlds
- Spiritual preparation for meeting Azrael through remembrance of death
- Azrael's appearance reflecting one's own spiritual condition

Sufi mystics often view Azrael not as a fearsome entity but as a compassionate guide who facilitates the soul's return to its Creator. The great Sufi poet Rumi wrote about death:

"Our death is our wedding with eternity.
What is the secret? 'God is One.'
The sunlight splits when entering the windows of the house.
This multiplicity exists in the cluster of grapes;
It is not in the juice made from the grapes.
For he who is living in the Light of God,
The death of the carnal soul is a blessing."

### Remembrance of Death

Islamic tradition places great emphasis on remembering death as a spiritual practice. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said:

"Remember frequently the destroyer of pleasures [death]." (Tirmidhi)

This remembrance serves multiple spiritual purposes:

- **Detachment from the World** - Helps believers avoid becoming too attached to temporary pleasures
- **Preparation** - Motivates righteous deeds and repentance before meeting Azrael
- **Perspective** - Provides proper context for life's trials and tribulations
- **Urgency** - Creates a sense of urgency in performing good deeds
- **Gratitude** - Enhances appreciation for the gift of life and time

## Theological Implications

### Divine Sovereignty

Azrael's role emphasizes key Islamic theological principles:

- Allah alone determines the time of death
- The angel acts only as an instrument of divine will
- Death is a planned transition, not a random occurrence
- Every soul has an appointed term (ajal) that cannot be altered
- Azrael has no discretion to delay or hasten death

The Quran emphasizes this divine sovereignty over life and death:

"No soul can die except by Allah's leave, at a term appointed." (Quran 3:145)

"Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you are within towers of lofty construction." (Quran 4:78)

These verses reinforce that Azrael operates strictly according to divine timing, not his own initiative or discretion.

### Death as a Return

In Islamic theology, death is consistently framed not as annihilation but as a return to Allah:

"To Allah we belong and to Him we shall return." (Quran 2:156)

Azrael facilitates this return, serving as the usher who guides souls back to their Creator. This conception transforms death from a purely negative event into a spiritual homecoming.

### Ethical Dimensions

Belief in Azrael carries several moral implications:

- Reminder of life's temporary nature
- Encouragement to prepare for inevitable death
- Motivation for righteousness to ensure a peaceful transition
- Warning against attachment to worldly existence
- Emphasis on accountability for one's actions

The certainty of encountering Azrael motivates believers to live with greater moral consciousness. As one saying attributed to Ali ibn Abi Talib states: "Live in this world as though you will live forever, but prepare for the Hereafter as though you will die tomorrow."

## The End of Time and Azrael

Islamic eschatology describes Azrael's role in the final events of the world:

1. **Taking the Last Souls** - As the world approaches its end, Azrael will continue his work until only the worst of creation remain
2. **Final Days** - After Israfil blows the first trumpet, Azrael will take the souls of all remaining creation
3. **Death of Angels** - All angels including Mika'il, Jibril, and Israfil will die
4. **Azrael's Own Death** - Finally, Allah will command Azrael to take his own soul
5. **Allah's Declaration** - After all creation has died, Allah will ask, "To whom belongs the dominion today?" and will answer, "To Allah, the One, the Irresistible."

After the second trumpet blast by the resurrected Israfil, all souls will be reunited with their bodies for judgment. Azrael's work in the present world will be complete, though tradition varies on whether he will have functions in the afterlife.

## Contemporary Relevance

- Provides theological framework for understanding death and mortality
- Offers spiritual perspective on loss and grieving
- Counters materialistic views that deny afterlife or spiritual dimensions
- Reminds believers of the purpose of life as preparation for death
- Contextualizes medical and ethical questions about end-of-life issues

In modern times, the concept of Azrael helps Muslims navigate difficult questions around death and dying:

- **Medical Ethics** - Islamic perspectives on end-of-life care emphasize that while treatment is encouraged, there is no requirement to artificially prolong life when death is inevitable, as the time of death is divinely decreed
- **Grief Process** - Understanding death as a divinely appointed transition rather than a random tragedy can provide comfort to the bereaved
- **Spiritual Preparation** - The certainty of meeting Azrael encourages contemporary Muslims to maintain spiritual readiness
- **Existential Meaning** - In a world often characterized by materialism, the figure of Azrael represents the reality of transcendent dimensions

## Cultural and Artistic Representations

While direct depictions of angels are generally avoided in Islamic tradition:

- Symbolic representations in poetry and literature
- Metaphorical references in religious instruction
- References in supplications and remembrance of death
- Cautious artistic allusions in some cultural expressions
- Vernacular cultural representations varying across Muslim societies

Despite prohibitions against depicting angels visually, Azrael appears frequently in Islamic literature and poetry. The Persian poet Hafez wrote:

"Be not afraid when the angel of death approaches,
For he will bring you to the presence of your Beloved."

In various cultural traditions across the Muslim world, Azrael is referenced in different ways:

- **South Asian Tradition** - Often referred to as "Izraeel" and frequently mentioned in mourning practices
- **Turkish Folk Tradition** - Sometimes depicted symbolically as a being with multiple eyes
- **Arabic Literature** - Featured prominently in classical works like "Kitab al-Ruh" (Book of the Soul) by Ibn Qayyim
- **Modern Expression** - Referenced in contemporary Muslim art, music, and literature as a symbol of life's transience

## Wisdom and Lessons from Azrael

The concept of Azrael and his function offers several spiritual lessons:

1. **Inevitability of Return** - Every soul must return to its Creator
2. **Divine Timing** - Each life has a precisely appointed term
3. **Preparation** - The wise prepare for their meeting with Azrael
4. **Equal Treatment** - Death comes to all, regardless of status or wealth
5. **Justice** - Death begins the process of divine accountability
6. **Perspective** - Remembering death provides clarity about life's priorities

As the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ advised: "Remember frequently the destroyer of pleasures [death], for no one remembers death in difficult times except that they become easier for him, and no one remembers death in times of ease except that they become constricted for him." This remembrance is not meant to induce despair but rather to instill mindfulness and purposeful living.
