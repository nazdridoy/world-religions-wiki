# Prophethood (النُّبُوَّة)

![Illustration of Islamic calligraphy representing prophethood](prophethood.jpg)

Prophethood (Nubuwwah) is a central concept in Islamic theology, referring to God's selection of righteous individuals throughout human history to receive divine revelation and guide humanity. In Islamic belief, prophets (Anbiya) and messengers (Rusul) serve as the conduits of divine guidance, demonstrating how God's commands should be implemented in human life. This institution of prophethood forms a continuous chain extending from the first human being, Adam, to the final prophet, Muhammad, establishing a sacred history that connects all monotheistic revelations.

## Theological Foundations

The Quran emphasizes that prophethood is a divine selection process independent of human will:

> "Allah chooses messengers from among the angels and from among the people. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing." (Quran 22:75)

Islamic theology maintains that prophethood is not acquired through spiritual exercises, moral excellence, or intellectual achievement, but is solely bestowed by Allah's grace. Prophets are born with innate qualities that prepare them for their mission, though they remain fully human.

## Categories of Divine Emissaries

Islamic tradition distinguishes between two types of divinely appointed emissaries:

### Nabi (Prophet)

* Receives divine revelation for personal guidance and for conveying to others
* May be given scripture or may follow a previously revealed book
* Continues the message of previous prophets without necessarily bringing new laws
* Every messenger (rasul) is also a prophet (nabi), but not every prophet is a messenger

### Rasul (Messenger)

* Receives a major revelation often with a new divine law (shariah)
* Typically granted a scripture or major revelation
* Often sent at critical junctures in history to reform or establish communities
* Has a more comprehensive mission, often establishing a new religious community
* Examples include Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad

## Attributes of Prophets

Islamic theology affirms that prophets possess certain essential qualities:

* **Isma (Protection)**: Divine protection from committing major sins
* **Sidq (Truthfulness)**: Absolute honesty and integrity in all affairs
* **Amanah (Trustworthiness)**: Perfect reliability in conveying divine message
* **Fatanah (Intelligence)**: Exceptional intellect and wisdom
* **Tabligh (Conveyance)**: Complete delivery of divine message without alteration

Despite these qualities, Islamic doctrine emphasizes that prophets remain human beings who experience normal human conditions:

> "We sent not before you (O Muhammad) but men to whom We revealed..." (Quran 12:109)

## The Prophetic Timeline

According to Islamic tradition, Allah has sent prophets to every human community:

> "And for every nation there is a messenger..." (Quran 10:47)

The Quran explicitly mentions 25 prophets by name, while Islamic tradition suggests there were approximately 124,000 prophets sent throughout history. Major prophets in the Islamic tradition include:

* **Adam**: The first human and prophet, who received basic guidance
* **Noah (Nuh)**: Survived the great flood and began human civilization anew
* **Abraham (Ibrahim)**: The patriarch of monotheism and builder of the Kaaba
* **Moses (Musa)**: Received the Torah and led the Israelites from Egypt
* **David (Dawud)**: Received the Psalms and established a righteous kingdom
* **Jesus (Isa)**: Received the Gospel and performed miracles by Allah's permission
* **Muhammad**: The final prophet who received the Quran and established Islam

## Functions of Prophethood

Prophets serve multiple essential functions in Islamic theology:

1. **Conveying Divine Revelation**: Transmitting Allah's guidance to humanity
2. **Exemplifying the Message**: Living the divine guidance through personal example
3. **Purifying Believers**: Helping people purify their hearts and souls
4. **Teaching Wisdom**: Explaining the deeper meaning of revelation
5. **Establishing Justice**: Implementing divine principles in society
6. **Warning and Bearing Witness**: Reminding people of divine judgment
7. **Bringing Glad Tidings**: Offering hope and describing divine reward

## Prophethood and Scripture

The divine messages brought by prophets took different forms:

* **Major Scriptures**: Torah (Tawrat), Psalms (Zabur), Gospel (Injil), and Quran
* **Scrolls (Suhuf)**: Smaller revelations given to prophets like Abraham
* **Divine Inspiration**: Direct guidance without necessarily forming scripture

Muslims believe that while all original revelations contained the same core truths, only the Quran remains in its original, uncorrupted form.

## Finality of Prophethood

A distinctive aspect of Islamic theology is the concept of Khatam an-Nabiyyin (Seal of the Prophets):

> "Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets. And Allah has full knowledge of all things." (Quran 33:40)

This doctrine establishes that:

* Muhammad is the final prophet and messenger
* The Quran is the final revelation
* The message of Islam completes and perfects previous revelations
* No new prophet or scripture will come after Muhammad

This belief does not negate the validity of previous prophets but places them within a progressive revelation culminating in Muhammad's mission.

## Prophethood Across Traditions

Islamic views of prophethood both align with and differ from other Abrahamic traditions:

* **Shared Prophets**: Many Biblical figures are recognized as prophets in Islam
* **Universal Mission**: Islam emphasizes that prophets were sent to all nations
* **Divine Protection**: Islamic theology emphasizes prophetic infallibility more than some traditions
* **Rejection of Divinity**: Islam strictly maintains prophets were human, not divine

## Prophetic Miracles

Islamic theology affirms that prophets performed miracles (mu'jizat) by God's permission as signs of their authentic mission:

* Noah's ark and the flood
* Abraham surviving the fire
* Moses parting the sea
* Jesus healing the sick and raising the dead
* Muhammad's night journey and the revelation of the Quran

The Quran itself is considered Muhammad's greatest miracle – an inimitable literary and spiritual achievement.

## Contemporary Significance

Prophethood remains relevant to modern Muslims in several ways:

* **Moral Exemplars**: Prophets provide ethical models for contemporary life
* **Religious Authority**: Their teachings form the basis of Islamic law and ethics
* **Spiritual Connection**: Love for the prophets is an essential aspect of faith
* **Cultural Expression**: Stories of prophets permeate Islamic art, literature, and architecture
* **Interfaith Bridge**: Shared prophetic figures create connections with other traditions
