# Muhammad (SM)'s Prophethood

In Islamic belief, Muhammad (SM) ibn Abdullah (570-632 CE) holds the singular position as the final prophet and messenger of Allah. His prophethood (*nubuwwah*) is a core article of faith and represents the culmination of divine revelation to humanity. Muslims believe that through Muhammad (SM), God completed His message and perfected the religion of Islam. The Islamic declaration of faith (shahadah) explicitly pairs belief in God's oneness with acknowledgment of Muhammad (SM)'s prophethood: "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad (SM) is the Messenger of Allah."

## The Nature of Muhammad (SM)'s Prophethood

Islamic doctrine distinguishes Muhammad (SM)'s role through several key qualities:

- **Khatam an-Nabiyyin**: Muhammad (SM) is believed to be the "Seal of the Prophets" (Quran 33:40), marking the end of prophetic succession
- **Universal Message**: Unlike some previous prophets sent to specific communities, Muhammad (SM)'s message is considered universal for all humanity
- **Comprehensiveness**: His revelation encompasses spiritual, social, political, economic and personal dimensions of human life
- **Preservation**: His message is believed to be perfectly preserved in the Quran and authentic Sunnah
- **Intercession**: Many Muslims believe Muhammad (SM) will intercede for believers on the Day of Judgment

## The Call to Prophethood

Muhammad (SM)'s prophetic mission began at age 40, around 610 CE:

- First revelation in the Cave of Hira during the month of Ramadan
- The angel Jibril (Gabriel) commanded him to "Read!" (Iqra), revealing the first verses of the Quran
- Initial period of private preaching to close family and companions
- Gradual transition to public proclamation of the message
- Persecution in Mecca followed by migration (Hijra) to Medina
- Establishment of the first Islamic community and state

## Prophetic Authority

Muhammad (SM)'s authority as a prophet manifests in multiple dimensions:

- **Scriptural Transmission**: Primary recipient and transmitter of the Quran
- **Scriptural Interpretation**: His explanations and applications of Quranic teachings
- **Legislative Authority**: His rulings and judgments form the basis of Islamic law
- **Exemplary Model**: His life serves as the perfect example (*uswa hasana*) for believers
- **Community Leadership**: His role as political, military and spiritual leader
- **Moral Reformation**: His mission to purify society and establish justice

## Muhammad (SM)'s Relationship to Other Prophets

Islamic theology places Muhammad (SM) in a continuum of divine messengers:

- Affirming previous prophets including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus
- Correcting what Muslims view as distortions in previous religious traditions
- Restoring the pure monotheism taught by all prophets
- Fulfilling prophecies about his coming allegedly found in previous scriptures
- Serving as the final authority on all matters of faith and practice

## Distinguishing Features of His Prophethood

Several aspects differentiate Muhammad (SM)'s prophethood in Islamic teaching:

- **Miracle of the Quran**: His primary miracle is the Quran itself, considered inimitable
- **Split of the Moon**: Among his physical miracles was reportedly splitting the moon
- **Night Journey**: The miraculous journey (Isra and Mi'raj) to Jerusalem and through the heavens
- **Shaq-e-Sadr**: The miraculous opening of his chest and purification of his heart
- **Living Example**: His complete life is documented and serves as a practical guide
- **Final Revelation**: No new prophet or scripture will come after him
- **Protection from Error**: The concept of 'isma (infallibility) in conveying divine guidance

## Contemporary Significance

Muhammad (SM)'s prophethood remains central to Muslim religious life:

- Invocation of blessings on him (salawat) in daily prayers and regular remembrance
