# Articles of Faith (أركان الإيمان)

![Illustration depicting the six articles of Islamic faith](articles_of_faith.jpg)

The Articles of Faith, known in Arabic as "Arkan al-Iman," constitute the fundamental beliefs that every Muslim must accept as a requirement of faith. These six essential principles form the theological foundation of Islam and are derived from the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad. While daily practices may vary among Muslims, these core beliefs unite the Islamic community across cultural, geographical, and denominational boundaries.

## Foundation in Islamic Sources

The six articles are explicitly mentioned in a famous hadith known as "Hadith Jibril" (Gabriel), in which the angel Gabriel questioned Prophet Muhammad about faith:

> "Faith (Iman) is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in divine destiny, both its good and its evil."

These tenets also appear throughout the Quran, such as in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:285):

> "The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, as do the believers. Each believes in Allah, His angels, His books, and His messengers..."

## The Six Articles of Faith

### 1. Belief in Allah (الإيمان بالله)

* The absolute oneness of God (Tawhid) is the most fundamental Islamic belief
* Affirms that Allah is the sole creator, sustainer, and master of the universe
* Rejects any form of polytheism or association of partners with God (shirk)
* Acknowledges Allah's perfect attributes and beautiful names (99 names)
* Maintains that God is transcendent yet accessible through prayer and remembrance

### 2. Belief in Angels (الإيمان بالملائكة)

* Angels are created from light as sentient beings who serve Allah
* They do not possess free will and exist solely to carry out divine commands
* Major angels include Jibril (Gabriel), Mikail (Michael), Israfil (who will blow the trumpet on Judgment Day), and Azrael (the angel of death)
* Angels record human deeds, support believers, and carry divine revelation
* They are imperceptible to normal human senses in their true form

### 3. Belief in Divine Books (الإيمان بالكتب)

* Allah has revealed guidance to humanity through sacred scriptures
* The Quran is the final, complete, and uncorrupted revelation
* Previous scriptures include the Torah (Tawrat), Psalms (Zabur), Gospel (Injil), and Scrolls of Abraham (Suhuf Ibrahim)
* Muslims believe earlier scriptures were altered over time
* The Quran serves as the criterion (Furqan) to distinguish truth from falsehood

### 4. Belief in Messengers (الإيمان بالرسل)

* Allah sent prophets to all nations throughout history to guide humanity
* All prophets taught the same essential message of monotheism
* The Quran mentions 25 prophets by name, though tradition states there were 124,000
* Major prophets include Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad
* Muhammad is the final prophet, the "Seal of the Prophets" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin)
* All prophets were human beings with exemplary character

### 5. Belief in the Last Day (الإيمان باليوم الآخر)

* Life on earth is temporary and will end with the Day of Judgment
* The world will be destroyed and all souls will be resurrected
* Every person will be accountable for their deeds in a divine court
* The righteous will enter Paradise (Jannah) and the wicked will enter Hell (Jahannam)
* Signs will precede the Last Day, including natural disasters and moral decay
* Only Allah knows when the Last Day will occur

### 6. Belief in Divine Decree (الإيمان بالقدر)

* Allah has full knowledge and control over all that happens
* Everything occurs by God's will and permission
* Allah's knowledge encompasses past, present, and future
* Humans possess free will and responsibility for their choices
* Divine decree does not compel human actions or remove accountability
* This concept balances divine sovereignty with human agency

## Theological Implications

These articles of faith have profound implications for Islamic thought:

* **Epistemology**: Revelation is considered the primary source of knowledge about ultimate reality
* **Ethics**: Moral standards derive from divine guidance rather than human consensus
* **Purpose**: Human existence is understood as a test for the eternal afterlife
* **Community**: Shared beliefs create solidarity among believers regardless of cultural differences
* **Worldview**: The universe is seen as intentionally created with meaning and purpose

## Denominational Perspectives

While all Muslims accept these six articles, interpretations vary among theological schools:

* **Sunni**: Generally emphasize a balance between divine determination and human free will
* **Shia**: Place special emphasis on divine justice ('Adl) in relation to divine decree
* **Mutazilite**: Historically emphasized human free will and rational interpretation
* **Ashari/Maturidi**: Developed nuanced positions on divine attributes and decree
* **Sufi**: Often focus on the experiential dimension of these beliefs

## Application in Daily Life

The articles of faith influence Muslim life in numerous ways:

* Shape daily prayers and supplications
* Guide ethical decision-making
* Provide comfort during hardship and loss
* Motivate charitable works and social responsibility
* Influence educational priorities and career choices
* Frame understanding of historical and current events

## Misconceptions

Common misunderstandings about Islamic faith include:

* Confusing belief in divine decree with fatalism
* Mischaracterizing Islamic monotheism as identical to other monotheistic traditions
* Assuming the belief in prophets negates respect for other religious traditions
* Oversimplifying complex theological concepts into rigid dogmas
