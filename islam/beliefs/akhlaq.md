# Akhlaq (الأخلاق): Islamic Character Ethics

![Islamic calligraphy depicting moral virtues](akhlaq.jpg)

Akhlaq refers to the Islamic concept of virtue ethics, moral character, and disposition. Derived from the Arabic root *kh-l-q* (relating to creation and innate qualities), akhlaq encompasses the cultivation of internal virtuous traits that manifest in righteous external conduct. In Islamic thought, akhlaq represents a comprehensive ethical framework centered on character development, moral excellence, and spiritual refinement. Prophet Muhammad emphasized its centrality, stating: "I have been sent only to perfect good character (akhlaq)" - a tradition that positions ethical conduct as the culmination of religious practice rather than merely one aspect of it. Islamic character ethics integrates theological foundations, spiritual practices, and practical wisdom to guide Muslims toward moral excellence in all dimensions of life.

## Quranic Foundations

The Quran establishes character ethics through numerous references:

> "And indeed, you [Muhammad] are of a great moral character." (Quran 68:4)

> "The believers who are most perfect in faith are those who have the best character." (Hadith, Tirmidhi)

> "Take what is given freely, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant." (Quran 7:199)

> "And speak to people good words." (Quran 2:83)

> "Those who suppress anger and pardon people - and Allah loves the doers of good." (Quran 3:134)

These and other passages establish virtues including:
* Truthfulness (sidq)
