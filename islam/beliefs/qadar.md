# Qadar (القدر)

![Illustration representing the Islamic concept of divine decree](qadar.jpg)

Qadar, often translated as "divine decree" or "predestination," constitutes the sixth pillar of Islamic faith. This complex theological concept addresses the relationship between divine sovereignty and human free will, affirming that Allah has complete knowledge and control over all events in the universe while humans retain moral responsibility for their choices. As a foundational belief, Qadar establishes that nothing occurs without Allah's knowledge, permission, and wisdom, yet it avoids the extremes of pure determinism or unrestricted free will.

## Theological Foundation

The concept of Qadar is rooted in numerous Quranic verses and prophetic traditions:

> "Verily, all things have We created in proportion and measure." (Quran 54:49)

> "No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allah." (Quran 57:22)

In Islamic theology, belief in Qadar encompasses several fundamental principles:

* **Divine Knowledge**: Allah's knowledge is absolute, encompassing past, present, and future
* **Divine Writing**: All events are recorded in the Preserved Tablet (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz)
* **Divine Will**: Nothing occurs except by Allah's permission
* **Divine Creation**: Allah is the creator of all things, including human actions
* **Human Responsibility**: Despite divine decree, humans possess free will and remain accountable

## Four Aspects of Qadar

Classical Islamic theology identifies four aspects of divine decree:

### 1. Divine Knowledge (Al-'Ilm)

* Allah's knowledge is perfect, eternal, and all-encompassing
* He knows what was, what is, and what will be
* He knows what exists and what does not exist, and how it would be if it did exist
* This knowledge does not change or develop over time
* It includes awareness of human choices before they are made

### 2. Divine Writing (Al-Kitabah)

* Allah has recorded all events that will occur until the Day of Judgment
* The Preserved Tablet (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz) contains this comprehensive record
* This writing precedes the creation of the universe
* It encompasses both general decrees and specific events
* Prophet Muhammad said: "Allah wrote the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth" (Muslim)

### 3. Divine Will (Al-Mashee'ah)

* Nothing occurs except by Allah's will and permission
* This applies to both good and evil, benefit and harm
* Allah's will is absolute and irresistible
* There is a distinction between what Allah wills and what Allah loves
* Some events may be permitted (willed) but not approved or loved

### 4. Divine Creation (Al-Khalq)

* Allah is the creator of all things, including human actions
* He creates both causes and effects
* Human actions are created by Allah but performed by humans
* This includes both physical capabilities and the power to choose
* The relationship between divine creation and human agency represents a profound theological mystery

## The Balance of Predestination and Free Will

Islamic theology navigates between determinism and unlimited free will:

### Divine Perspective

* From Allah's perspective, all events are known and decreed
* The complete timeline of history exists in divine knowledge
* Nothing surprises Allah or occurs outside His plan
* All events serve divine wisdom, even if humans cannot comprehend it

### Human Perspective

* From the human perspective, choices are real and consequential
* Individuals experience genuine options and make authentic decisions
* Responsibility stems from this subjective experience of choice
* Moral accountability depends on intention and capacity

### Reconciliation

Islamic scholars offer several approaches to reconciling these perspectives:

* **Acquisition (Kasb)**: Humans "acquire" actions created by Allah
* **Two Aspects of Will**: Distinguishing between Allah's creative will and legislative will
* **Secondary Causation**: Allah creates causes that operate according to consistent patterns
* **Divine Enablement**: Allah creates the capacity to choose, but humans determine its use
* **Mystery (Bila Kayf)**: Accepting that the full reconciliation exceeds human comprehension

## Historical Theological Positions

Throughout Islamic history, various theological schools developed distinct approaches to Qadar:

### Jabriyyah (Determinists)

* Emphasized absolute divine determination
* Humans have no real agency or choice
* Actions are merely attributed to humans while fully created by Allah
* This position was generally rejected by mainstream Islam as diminishing responsibility

### Qadariyyah (Libertarians)

* Emphasized human free will to the point of limiting divine knowledge or power
* Humans create their own actions independently
* This position was criticized for limiting divine sovereignty
* Generally rejected by mainstream Islam

### Mu'tazilah

* Affirmed human free will while maintaining divine knowledge
* Argued that humans create their own actions
* Emphasized divine justice requiring human freedom
* Distinguished between divine knowledge and compulsion

### Ash'ari School

* Developed the theory of "acquisition" (kasb)
* Allah creates human actions, but humans "acquire" them
* Emphasized divine omnipotence
* Maintained human responsibility through intention

### Maturidi School

* Similar to Ash'ari position but gave more emphasis to human agency
* Humans have real but limited free will
* Distinguished between Allah's creating power and human choosing
* Balanced divine sovereignty with human responsibility

### Traditional (Athari) Position

* Affirmed both divine decree and human responsibility without elaborate explanation
* Accepted the apparent meanings of texts without extensive rationalization
* Emphasized practical moral implications over theoretical resolution
* Maintained the mystery of reconciliation as beyond human comprehension

## Practical Implications

Belief in Qadar influences Muslim life in numerous ways:

### Spiritual Attitudes

* **Trust (Tawakkul)**: Reliance on Allah while taking necessary actions
* **Contentment (Ridha)**: Acceptance of outcomes after proper effort
* **Gratitude (Shukr)**: Attributing all good to Allah's blessing
* **Patience (Sabr)**: Enduring difficulties with recognition of divine wisdom
* **Humility (Tawadu')**: Recognizing human limitation and dependence

### Moral Responsibility

* **Accountability**: Despite predestination, humans remain responsible for choices
* **Effort**: Divine decree does not justify fatalism or passivity
* **Repentance**: Past sins are not excused by appealing to destiny
* **Striving**: Muslims are obligated to work toward positive outcomes
* **Moral Growth**: Self-improvement remains a religious duty

### Practical Wisdom

* **Balance**: Avoiding both fatalism and self-reliance
* **Cause and Effect**: Respecting natural laws while recognizing divine control
* **Planning**: Making preparations while acknowledging divine determination
* **Retrospection**: Learning from past events without obsessive regret
* **Prospection**: Setting goals without assuming guaranteed outcomes

## Common Misconceptions

Several misunderstandings about Qadar persist:

* **Fatalism**: The mistaken belief that effort is useless since everything is predetermined
* **Arbitrary Determination**: Incorrect notion that divine decree is random rather than based on perfect wisdom
* **Excuse for Sin**: Wrongly attributing one's wrongdoing to divine decree
* **Denial of Causality**: Mistaken rejection of natural causes and effects
* **Questioning Disasters**: Improper challenging of divine wisdom in calamities
* **Simple Determinism**: Oversimplification of the complex relationship between divine knowledge and human choice

## Contemporary Perspectives

Modern Muslim scholars approach Qadar in several ways:

* **Traditional Affirmation**: Maintaining classical positions with renewed articulation
* **Philosophical Integration**: Drawing on modern philosophy of mind and time
* **Scientific Context**: Exploring relationships with concepts like physical causation and quantum indeterminacy
* **Existential Emphasis**: Focusing on the lived experience of choice rather than theoretical resolution
* **Practical Focus**: Emphasizing ethical implications over metaphysical details

## Comparative Perspectives

The Islamic concept of Qadar can be compared with similar concepts in other traditions:

* **Christianity**: Similar tensions between divine sovereignty and human freedom, with various denominational positions
* **Judaism**: Comparable emphasis on divine knowledge and human responsibility
* **Greek Philosophy**: Distinct from both Stoic determinism and Epicurean chance
* **Modern Philosophy**: Different from both hard determinism and libertarianism
* **Eastern Traditions**: Contrasts with karmic concepts while sharing some functional similarities
