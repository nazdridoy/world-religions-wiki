# Maturidi Theology (الماتريدية)

![Illustration of Islamic theological tradition](maturidi.jpg)

Maturidi theology represents one of the major orthodox Sunni theological schools, named after its founder Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 944 CE). Emerging in Transoxiana (modern-day Central Asia), this theological approach developed alongside the Hanafi school of jurisprudence and offered a balanced perspective that acknowledged the role of reason in understanding revelation. While sharing many positions with the more widely known Ash'ari school, Maturidi theology grants greater scope to human reason and agency, while maintaining traditional Sunni positions on divine attributes and scriptural authority. It has historically been the predominant theological orientation among Turkic Muslims and continues to exert significant influence in Central Asia, Turkey, the Balkans, and parts of the Indian subcontinent.
