# Angels (الملائكة)

![Artistic depiction of Islamic concept of angels](angels.jpg)

Angels (Malaikah) constitute a fundamental element of Islamic belief, representing a distinct class of Allah's creation made from light (nur) and tasked with various cosmic and spiritual responsibilities. As one of the six articles of faith in Islam, belief in angels acknowledges the existence of these unseen beings who faithfully execute divine commands without question or hesitation. Unlike humans, angels lack free will and exist in perfect submission to Allah, serving as intermediaries between the divine and earthly realms.

## Nature and Characteristics

According to Islamic sources, angels possess distinctive qualities that differentiate them from other creations:

> "All praise is due to Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels messengers having wings - two, three, or four..." (Quran 35:1)

Key characteristics include:

* **Created from Light**: Prophet Muhammad stated, "Angels were created from light, jinn from smokeless fire, and Adam from what has been described to you" (Sahih Muslim)
* **Non-Material Existence**: Possess ethereal bodies that can assume various forms
* **Genderless**: Neither male nor female, they do not procreate or have progeny
* **Wings**: Described as having multiple wings in varying numbers
* **Non-Consumption**: Do not eat, drink, or have physical needs
* **Immortality**: Do not die except by Allah's will at the end of time
* **Invisibility**: Generally unseen by humans in their natural state
* **Sinlessness**: Incapable of disobedience to Allah
* **Tirelessness**: Never experience fatigue in their divine service

## Hierarchy and Organization

Islamic tradition suggests a hierarchical arrangement among angels, though details are limited to what is revealed in scriptural sources:
