# Mu'tazila (المعتزلة)

![Illustration depicting rationalist theological discourse](mutazila.jpg)

The Mu'tazila movement represents the first major rationalist theological school in Islamic history, emerging in the 8th century CE in Basra and Baghdad. Distinguished by their emphasis on reason ('aql) as a primary theological tool and their commitment to divine justice and unity, the Mu'tazilites developed sophisticated theological frameworks that profoundly influenced the development of Islamic thought. Though politically ascendant during parts of the Abbasid era, Mu'tazilism eventually declined as a dominant theological position, yet its intellectual legacy continues to impact Islamic theological discourse. Often characterized as the "rationalists" or "free-thinkers" of classical Islam, the Mu'tazila sought to defend Islamic beliefs through logical reasoning while emphasizing divine justice and transcendence.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Founding

* Traditionally linked to Wasil ibn Ata's (d. 748) withdrawal (i'tizal) from Hasan al-Basri's circle
* Emerged in Basra and quickly spread to Baghdad in the 8th century CE
* Developed during the early Abbasid period amid intellectual ferment
* Responded to internal theological debates and external challenges from non-Muslim traditions
* Influenced by engagement with Greek philosophical traditions being translated into Arabic
* Initially gained traction among intellectual elites and certain political circles

### Golden Age

* Reached its pinnacle under Abbasid Caliphs al-Ma'mun, al-Mu'tasim, and al-Wathiq (813-847 CE)
* Briefly became state-sponsored theology during the Mihna (inquisition) period
* Developed systematic theological frameworks and sophisticated dialectical methods
* Produced major works of theology that shaped subsequent discourse
* Established flourishing schools of thought in major intellectual centers
* Engaged in sustained debates with traditionalist opponents

### Decline and Legacy

* Lost political support after Caliph al-Mutawakkil reversed state policy in 848 CE
* Gradually marginalized as Ash'ari and Maturidi theological schools gained prominence
* Continued as minority position, especially in Shi'ite intellectual circles
* Many Mu'tazili ideas incorporated into mainstream theological discourse
* Experienced limited revivals in later periods, especially in Zaydi Shi'ism
* Modern interest as potential resource for contemporary Islamic rationalism

## Core Principles

### The Five Fundamentals (al-Usul al-Khamsa)

The Mu'tazila position is traditionally summarized through five core principles:

#### 1. Divine Unity (al-Tawhid)

* Radical emphasis on God's absolute oneness and simplicity
* Rejection of eternally existing divine attributes separate from God's essence
* Denial of anthropomorphic descriptions of God taken literally
* Assertion of the created nature of the Quran (to maintain divine unity)
* Emphasis on God's transcendence and dissimilarity from creation

#### 2. Divine Justice (al-'Adl)

* Affirmation that God acts justly and never oppresses His creation
* Humans possess free will to enable moral accountability
* Evil acts cannot be attributed to God's direct creation or will
* God is obligated by His nature to reward the righteous and punish wrongdoers
* God must do what is best for His creation (al-aslah)

#### 3. Promise and Threat (al-Wa'd wa al-Wa'id)

* God must fulfill His promises of reward and threats of punishment
* No intercession can spare serious sinners from deserved punishment
* Serious sinners will face eternal punishment if they die unrepentant
* God cannot forgive major sins without repentance as this would violate justice
* Divine warnings in scripture must be taken as definitive, not contingent

#### 4. Intermediate Position (al-Manzila bayn al-Manzilatayn)

* Muslim grave sinners occupy a status between belief and disbelief
* Such sinners are neither complete believers nor complete disbelievers
* They remain monotheists but have fallen into serious moral transgression
* This position influenced their view on political legitimacy and community boundaries
* Distinguished Mu'tazila from both Kharijite extremism and perceived Murji'ite laxity

#### 5. Commanding Right and Forbidding Wrong (al-Amr bi'l-Ma'ruf wa'l-Nahy 'an al-Munkar)

* Moral obligation to promote virtue and oppose vice in society
* Justification for political activism and opposition to tyranny
* Emphasis on human responsibility for creating just social order
* Applied to both individual ethics and collective political action
* Theological basis for social and political engagement

## Theological Positions

### Epistemology

* Reason is an independent source of knowledge alongside revelation
* Certain moral and theological truths are discernible through rational inquiry
* Rational knowledge obligates belief even before revelation
* Rational investigation is a religious duty for capable individuals
* Tradition and authority must be verified through rational examination
* Knowledge categorized into necessary (daruri) and acquired (muktasab)

### Nature of God

* God's essence cannot be divided into separate attributes
* Divine attributes are identical with His essence, not additions to it
* God is necessarily just and cannot commit evil or oppression
* God's will is constrained by His wisdom and justice
* God's actions always have rational purposes and aims
* Complete denial of literal anthropomorphic descriptions of God

### Creation and Cosmology

* World is created ex nihilo but not directly by God in every instance
* Secondary causality operates through natural laws established by God
* God creates through intermediary causes in accordance with wisdom
* Atomistic view of physical reality common among many Mu'tazilites
* Natural world demonstrates rational order reflecting divine wisdom
* Rejection of occult causes and miraculous disruptions of natural order

### Human Freedom and Responsibility

* Humans "create" their own voluntary actions through derived power from God
* God grants humans genuine capability (istita'a) before each action
* Without free will, divine justice in reward and punishment would be meaningless
* Moral obligation (taklif) requires genuine ability to choose
* Divine foreknowledge does not negate human freedom
* Determinism would make God responsible for human evil acts

### Good and Evil

* Moral values have objective reality independent of revelation
* Some actions are intrinsically good or evil by their nature
* Reason can discern the moral quality of many actions prior to revelation
* God commands what is good because it is good (not vice versa)
* Revelation confirms and completes what reason can discover about morality
* Rejection of divine voluntarism (the view that good is simply what God wills)
