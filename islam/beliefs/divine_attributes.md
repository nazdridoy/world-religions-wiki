# Divine Attributes (Sifat Allah)

![Divine Names and Attributes](divine_attributes.jpg)

The divine attributes (sifat Allah) in Islamic theology refer to the qualities and characteristics of Allah that are affirmed in the Quran and hadith. These attributes provide Muslims with a framework for understanding and relating to God, while acknowledging that the full reality of Allah's nature transcends human comprehension. Islamic theology carefully balances between affirming these attributes and maintaining Allah's absolute transcendence, resulting in a nuanced understanding of divine qualities that distinguishes Islamic conceptions of God from those of other monotheistic traditions.

## Categories of Divine Attributes

Islamic theological traditions classify divine attributes in several ways:

### Essential vs. Active Attributes

- **Essential Attributes (Sifat al-Dhatiyyah)**: These are qualities intrinsic to Allah's essence, such as existence, oneness, eternity, and self-sufficiency.
  
- **Active Attributes (Sifat al-Fi'liyyah)**: These relate to Allah's actions and interactions with creation, such as creating, sustaining, forgiving, and judging.

### Attributes of Essence, Attributes of Action

Another traditional classification distinguishes between:

- **Attributes of Essence (Sifat al-Dhat)**: These describe what Allah is in Himself, regardless of creation (e.g., knowledge, power, life).
  
- **Attributes of Action (Sifat al-Af'al)**: These describe divine activities in relation to creation (e.g., creating, providing, guiding).

### Affirmative vs. Negative Attributes

- **Affirmative Attributes (Sifat al-Thubutiyyah)**: These affirm certain qualities in Allah (e.g., knowledge, power, mercy).
  
- **Negative Attributes (Sifat al-Salbiyyah)**: These negate imperfections or limitations from Allah (e.g., freedom from partners, needs, or beginning).

## Key Divine Attributes

While the comprehensive list of divine attributes is derived from the 99 Beautiful Names of Allah, several attributes are particularly emphasized in Islamic theology:

### Life (Al-Hayy)

Allah possesses perfect, eternal, and self-sustained life that has no beginning or end and is dependent on nothing.

### Knowledge (Al-'Alim)

Allah's knowledge is all-encompassing, perfect, and eternal, extending to all things past, present, and future, as well as all possibilities.

### Power (Al-Qadir)

Allah possesses absolute power over all things, with no limitation or constraint. Nothing occurs except by His will and permission.

### Will (Al-Murid)

Allah possesses a perfect will that determines all events according to His wisdom, with nothing occurring outside His volition.

### Speech (Al-Mutakallim)

Allah communicates through revelation and direct address, with the Quran being the manifestation of divine speech.

### Sight and Hearing (Al-Basir, Al-Sami')

Allah sees and hears all things without organs or limitations, perceiving all things simultaneously.

### Mercy (Al-Rahman, Al-Raheem)

Allah's mercy encompasses all creation and is the dominant quality through which He relates to humanity.

### Justice (Al-'Adl)

Allah is perfectly just in His decrees and judgments, with no injustice or partiality in His decisions.

## Theological Approaches to Divine Attributes

Historical debates about divine attributes have shaped various Islamic theological positions:

### Literalist Approach

The Athari (literalist) tradition, associated with scholars like Ahmad ibn Hanbal, affirms all attributes mentioned in the Quran and hadith without metaphorical interpretation, while avoiding speculation about their modality (bi-la kayf).

### Rational Interpretation

The Mu'tazilite school emphasized Allah's transcendence by either interpreting anthropomorphic attributes metaphorically or subsuming them under broader attributes to avoid any resemblance between God and creation.

### Middle Path

The Ash'ari and Maturidi schools, representing mainstream Sunni theology, affirm divine attributes while emphasizing their uniqueness and dissimilarity to human qualitiesâ€”affirmation without anthropomorphism and transcendence without negation.

### Philosophical Approaches

Muslim philosophers like Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and later thinkers developed sophisticated philosophical frameworks for understanding divine attributes, often harmonizing revelation with Aristotelian and Neoplatonic concepts.

## Interpreting Anthropomorphic Attributes

The Quran contains expressions that, if taken literally, might suggest physical attributes to Allah, such as "hand," "face," or "establishing Himself on the throne." Islamic theological traditions have addressed these in different ways:

### Tafwid (Delegation)

Many early Muslims affirmed these attributes while delegating knowledge of their true meaning to Allah, accepting them "without asking how" (bi-la kayf).

### Ta'wil (Interpretation)

Others interpret these expressions metaphorically or allegorically: "hand" as power or generosity, "face" as essence or presence, and "establishing on the throne" as authority and control.

### Balance Approach

Mainstream Islamic theology emphasizes that while such expressions must be affirmed as Allah described Himself, they must not be understood in ways that resemble creation or imply limitation.

## Divine Attributes and Spiritual Life

Understanding divine attributes has profound implications for Muslim spiritual and ethical life:

- Recognition of Allah's complete knowledge and presence inspires mindfulness (taqwa)
- Contemplation of divine mercy and compassion motivates hope and ethical behavior
- Awareness of divine justice encourages accountability and moral responsibility
- Reflection on divine perfection inspires striving for excellence (ihsan)

## Contemporary Discussions

Modern Muslim theologians engage with several issues concerning divine attributes:

- Reconciling traditional theological formulations with contemporary philosophical frameworks
- Addressing tensions between deterministic implications of divine knowledge and human free will
- Exploring how divine attributes relate to scientific understandings of causality and natural law
- Developing interfaith dialogue based on comparable understandings of God across traditions
