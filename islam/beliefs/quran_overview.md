# Quran Overview (القرآن الكريم)

![Illuminated page from the Holy Quran](quran_overview.jpg)

The Quran (also spelled Koran or Qur'an) is the central religious text of Islam, believed by Muslims to be a divine revelation from Allah to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel (Jibril). Considered the literal word of God and the final revelation to humanity, the Quran serves as the primary source of Islamic belief and practice. Its 114 chapters (surahs) form a comprehensive guidance covering spiritual, social, legal, and ethical aspects of human existence, making it foundational to every dimension of Muslim life.

## Nature and Revelation

The Quran was revealed gradually over approximately 23 years (610-632 CE):

* The first revelation came to Muhammad in the Cave of Hira near Mecca
* The initial revelations generally focused on monotheism, divine attributes, and the afterlife
* Later revelations, particularly those in Medina, addressed social legislation and community organization
* Each revelation was memorized by the Prophet and his companions, and recorded by scribes

Muslims believe the Quran is:

* **Uncreated**: The eternal speech of Allah that has always existed
* **Inimitable**: Impossible to replicate in literary excellence (i'jaz)
* **Preserved**: Protected from corruption throughout history
* **Universal**: Intended for all humanity across all times
* **Complete**: Contains all necessary guidance for human salvation

## Structure and Arrangement

The Quran consists of:

* 114 Surahs (chapters)
* Approximately 6,236 Ayat (verses)
* 30 Juz' (parts) of roughly equal length for recitation purposes

The surahs are arranged primarily by length rather than chronology, with longer chapters generally placed at the beginning (except for the opening chapter, Al-Fatiha). Each surah has a distinct name derived from a notable word or theme within it.

Surahs are traditionally categorized as either:

* **Meccan**: Revealed before the migration to Medina (generally shorter, focusing on faith, monotheism, resurrection)
* **Medinan**: Revealed after the migration (generally longer, addressing social and legal matters)

## Key Themes and Content

## Interpretation and Study

* Considering linguistic conventions of classical Arabic
* Consulting authentic prophetic explanations

## Engagement with the Quran

Muslims engage with the Quran in multiple ways:

### Recitation (Tilawah)

* Governed by precise rules of pronunciation (tajwid)
* Considered an act of worship
* Often practiced in melodious styles (qira'at)
* Memorization (hifz) highly valued – those who memorize the entire text are called Huffaz

### Study (Tadabbur)

* Regular reading with reflection
* Group study sessions
* Formal educational programs
* Commentary-based exploration

### Ritual Use

* Recited during daily prayers
* Featured in lifecycle events (births, weddings, funerals)
* Recited during Ramadan (especially during Taraweeh prayers)
* Used in protective supplications (ruqyah)

### Physical Respect

## The Quran in Muslim Life

The Quran influences Muslim life in profound ways:

* **Spiritual Foundation**: Provides connection to divine guidance
* **Moral Compass**: Offers ethical principles for daily decisions
* **Community Cohesion**: Creates shared language and reference point

## Translations and Global Reach

As Islam spread globally, the Quran has been translated into virtually every major language, though these translations are considered interpretations rather than substitutes for the Arabic original.

Muslims maintain that:

* The Arabic Quran alone constitutes the actual revelation
* Translations inevitably lose nuances and multiple layers of meaning
* Learning Arabic is encouraged to access the text directly
* Recitation should ideally occur in the original Arabic
