# Ash'ari Theology (الأشعرية)

![Illustration of traditional Islamic theological discourse](ashari.jpg)

Ash'arism represents one of the most influential theological schools (kalam) in Sunni Islam, founded by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (874-936 CE) after his departure from Mu'tazilite rationalism. Positioned as a middle path between pure rationalism and literal textualism, the Ash'ari approach has profoundly shaped Islamic theological discourse for over a millennium. This school emerged as a response to the theological challenges of its time, offering systematic defenses of traditional Sunni beliefs while incorporating rational methodologies. Today, Ash'arism remains predominant in many parts of the Muslim world, particularly in Shafi'i, Maliki, and traditional Hanafi religious educational institutions.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Founder

* Founded by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 936 CE), originally a student of the Mu'tazilite teacher al-Juba'i
* Al-Ash'ari's dramatic conversion from Mu'tazilism occurred reportedly after three dreams of Prophet Muhammad
* His conversion represented a return to traditional positions while retaining rational methodologies
* Developed as a reaction to both extreme rationalism and literalism in Islamic thought
* Initially faced opposition from both Mu'tazilites and strict traditionalists

### Classical Period

* Abu Bakr al-Baqillani (d. 1013) systematized and expanded Ash'ari theology
* Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni (d. 1085) further refined the school's positions
* Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (d. 1111) incorporated Ash'ari theology into a broader intellectual synthesis
* Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 1209) developed sophisticated responses to philosophical challenges
* Integration with Shafi'i and other legal schools through institutional education

### Later Developments

* Merging with elements of Maturidi thought in later centuries
* Influence on Sufi theological formulations, particularly through al-Ghazali
* Codification in standard theological manuals (mutun) used in madrasas
* Regional variations in North Africa, Egypt, the Levant, and Southeast Asia
* Modern reformulations addressing contemporary challenges

## Core Theological Positions

### Divine Attributes

* God's attributes are real and eternal, neither identical to nor separate from His essence
* Affirmation of the seven essential attributes: Life, Knowledge, Power, Will, Hearing, Seeing, and Speech
* Quran is the uncreated, eternal speech of God
* All divine attributes mentioned in scripture are true but understood without anthropomorphism (bila kaif)
* Distinction between essential attributes (sifat al-dhat) and attributes of action (sifat al-fi'l)

### Divine Will and Human Actions

* God is the creator of all human acts, while humans "acquire" (kasb) their actions
* Theory of acquisition (kasb/iktisab) reconciles divine determination with human responsibility
* All events occur through God's will and creation
* Humans have no causal efficacy in producing their actions independently
* Moral responsibility stems from intention and "acquisition" rather than creation of actions

### Epistemology

* Religious knowledge derived primarily from revelation, supplemented by reason
* Reason alone insufficient for knowing religious obligations and moral values
* Good and evil are determined by divine revelation, not reason alone
* Certainty in religious matters requires scriptural evidence
* Reason serves as a tool to understand revelation and defend religious doctrines

### Cosmology

* Atomistic view of creation - substances consist of indivisible atoms
* Universe sustained through continuous divine creation (tajdid al-khalq)
* Natural causality is merely habitual association (God creates causes and effects separately)
* Miracles represent breaks in habitual patterns rather than violations of natural law
* Emphasis on God's moment-by-moment sustaining of creation

## Distinctive Methodological Features

### Use of Rational Arguments

* Employment of logical syllogisms and rational proofs for theological positions
* Development of the "argument from contingency" for God's existence
* Systematic refutations of opposing theological and philosophical systems
* Analysis of linguistic meaning and signification
* Balance between revelation (naql) and reason ('aql)

### Interpretive Approach to Texts

* Ta'wil (figurative interpretation) applied to anthropomorphic descriptions of God
* Affirmation of apparent meaning where compatible with divine transcendence
* Delegation (tafwid) of precise meaning to God when necessary
* Priority given to decisive (muhkam) verses over ambiguous (mutashabih) ones
* Contextual reading of scriptural passages

### Engagement with Philosophy

* Critical integration of Aristotelian and Neoplatonic concepts
* Refutation of philosophical positions contradicting revealed doctrine
* Adaptation of philosophical terminology for theological purposes
* Sophisticated philosophical arguments against materialists and naturalists
* Distinction between demonstrative and dialectical reasoning
