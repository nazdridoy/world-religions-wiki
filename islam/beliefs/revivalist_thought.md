# Revivalist Thought in Islam

![Islamic scholars addressing a gathering](revivalist_thought.jpg)

Islamic revivalist thought encompasses a spectrum of intellectual and social movements that seek to restore and reinvigorate what adherents consider authentic Islamic beliefs, practices, and sociopolitical structures in response to perceived religious decline, Western cultural dominance, and internal challenges. While diverse in their specific approaches, revivalist movements generally emphasize a return to foundational sources (the Quran and Sunnah), critique innovations and foreign influences they view as contrary to Islamic principles, and advocate for a comprehensive implementation of Islamic teachings in both personal and collective life. Emerging from the 18th century onwards and continuing into contemporary times, Islamic revivalism represents a significant response to modernity that has profoundly shaped Muslim societies worldwide through educational institutions, social organizations, political movements, and intellectual frameworks.
