# Interfaith Relations in Islam

![Muslim, Jewish, and Christian leaders in dialogue](interfaith.jpg)

Interfaith relations in Islam encompass the broad spectrum of interactions, dialogues, and engagements between Muslims and adherents of other religious traditions. While rooted in theological principles, interfaith engagement extends beyond doctrinal discussions to include practical coexistence, social cooperation, shared ethical concerns, and mutual understanding across religious boundaries. Islamic approaches to interfaith relations derive from Quranic guidance on religious diversity, the prophetic example of engagement with non-Muslims, and a historical legacy of managing plural religious societies. These relations have evolved significantly through history, from the early Medinan community to modern globalized contexts, reflecting both enduring principles and adapting to changing social, political, and cultural realities.

## Quranic Foundations

The Quran provides key principles governing Muslim relations with other faith communities:

> "O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you." (Quran 49:13)

> "There shall be no compulsion in religion." (Quran 2:256)

> "And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variations in your languages and your colors; verily in that are Signs for those who know." (Quran 30:22)

> "Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly." (Quran 60:8)

These and other verses establish several foundational concepts:
* Human diversity as divinely ordained
* Religious freedom and non-compulsion
* Justice toward all regardless of faith
* Special relationship with "People of the Book" (Jews and Christians)
* Invitation to common principles across faith boundaries

## Historical Development
