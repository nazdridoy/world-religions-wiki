# Day of Judgment (يوم القيامة)

![Illustration representing the Islamic concept of the Day of Judgment](day_of_judgment.jpg)

The Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyamah), also known as the Last Day (al-Yawm al-Akhir) or the Day of Resurrection (Yawm al-Ba'th), represents the culmination of human history in Islamic eschatology. As the fifth article of Islamic faith, belief in the Day of Judgment establishes that this worldly existence is temporary and that Allah will one day end the current order, resurrect all human beings, and hold them accountable for their earthly deeds. This momentous event will mark the transition from the temporal realm to the eternal afterlife, where divine justice will be perfectly realized.

## Theological Significance

The Quran emphasizes the Day of Judgment throughout its chapters, mentioning it under various names nearly 100 times:

> "And the Day the Horn is blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will be terrified except whom Allah wills. And all will come to Him humbled." (Quran 27:87)

This belief serves several theological purposes:

* **Divine Justice**: Ensures complete accountability where worldly justice may fail
* **Moral Motivation**: Provides incentive for righteousness and deterrent from evil
* **Ultimate Meaning**: Gives purpose to human existence beyond material pursuits
* **Cosmic Completion**: Represents the fulfillment of Allah's plan for creation
* **Divine Sovereignty**: Affirms Allah's absolute authority over time and eternity

## Signs of the Last Day

Islamic tradition describes two categories of signs that will precede the Day of Judgment:

### Minor Signs (Already Appearing)

* Decrease in religious knowledge and increase in ignorance
* Widespread consumption of intoxicants and normalization of immorality
* Prevalence of musical instruments and entertainment
* Disobedience to parents and elevation of friends above family
* Speaking ill of previous generations
* Increase in worldly wealth and competition in construction
* Spread of usury (riba) and dishonesty in business
* Displacement of Arabic as the primary language of Muslim discourse
* Appearance of false prophets (numerous historical claims)
* Increase in natural disasters, wars, and civil strife

### Major Signs (Yet to Appear)

* The appearance of the Mahdi (the divinely guided one)
* The return of Jesus (Isa) son of Mary
* The emergence of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj wa Ma'juj)
* The appearance of the Dajjal (the great deceiver, similar to Antichrist)
* Three major landslides in the East, West, and Arabian Peninsula
* Smoke covering the earth
* Rising of the sun from the West
* Emergence of the Beast of the Earth (Dabbat al-Ard)
* A great fire driving people to their final gathering place
* The Quran being removed from the world (physically and from hearts)

## Stages of the Final Day

Islamic sources detail a sequence of events that will constitute the Day of Judgment:

### 1. The End of the World

* The angel Israfil will blow the Horn (Sur), causing all creation to perish
* The heavens will be rolled up and the stars will scatter
* Mountains will crumble and seas will boil over
* The earth will be flattened and transformed
* A period of complete cessation of existence follows (except for Allah)

### 2. Resurrection (Ba'th)

* The Horn will be blown a second time
* All human beings from throughout history will be resurrected physically
* Bodies will be reconstituted, and souls reunited with bodies
* People will rise from their graves in a state of bewilderment

> "And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on." (Quran 39:68)

### 3. The Gathering (Hashr)

* All humanity will be gathered on a vast transformed plain
* People will stand naked, uncircumcised, and barefoot
* The sun will be brought near, causing intense suffering
* People will sweat according to their deeds
* Prophets and righteous will be shaded under the Throne of Allah

### 4. The Wait and Intercession (Shafa'a)

* Humanity will wait in agonizing anticipation
* People will seek intercession from prophets, beginning with Adam
* Each prophet will defer until reaching Muhammad
* The Prophet Muhammad will prostrate before Allah and be granted permission to intercede
* This "Major Intercession" (Al-Shafa'a al-Uzma) begins the judgment process

### 5. Judgment (Hisab)

* Records of deeds will be presented to each person
* The righteous will receive their records in their right hand, the sinful in their left or behind their back
* The balance (Mizan) will weigh each person's good and evil deeds
* People will testify against themselves, and their limbs may speak of their actions
* Allah's judgment will be absolutely just, with even the smallest deed accounted for

> "And We place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be treated unjustly at all. And if there is [even] the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as accountant." (Quran 21:47)

### 6. The Path (Sirat)

* A bridge will be placed over Hell, described as thinner than a hair and sharper than a sword
* All must cross it to reach Paradise
* The righteous will cross quickly according to their deeds
* The sinful will slip and fall into Hell

### 7. Final Destination

* The righteous enter Paradise (Jannah)
* The wicked enter Hell (Jahannam)
* Some sinful believers may enter Hell temporarily before eventually being admitted to Paradise
* Eternal existence begins in either realm

## Paradise (Jannah)

The Quran and hadith describe Paradise as the ultimate reward for the righteous:

* Multiple levels with the highest being Firdaus
* Rivers of pure water, milk, honey, and wine that doesn't intoxicate
* Magnificent gardens, mansions, and pavilions
* Delicious fruits and food
* Pure companions (hur al-'ayn)
* Youth-preserving environment where no one ages
* Freedom from all negative emotions and physical discomforts
* The greatest reward: seeing the countenance of Allah (beatific vision)

## Hell (Jahannam)

Islamic sources describe Hell as the abode of punishment for disbelievers and sinners:

* Multiple levels with the lowest reserved for hypocrites
* Intense fire and boiling water
* Various forms of physical punishment
* Bitter, thorny food and scalding drink
* Garments of fire
* Eternal punishment for disbelievers
* Temporary punishment for sinful believers until purification

## Theological Perspectives

Different Islamic schools offer varying interpretations of Judgment Day concepts:

* **Traditionalists (Athari)**: Take descriptions literally as presented in texts
* **Ash'ari/Maturidi**: Affirm the reality while allowing for some metaphorical interpretations
* **Philosophical Approaches**: May interpret some elements symbolically while maintaining core beliefs
* **Mystics (Sufis)**: Often emphasize spiritual dimensions and divine mercy
* **Modernists**: May reinterpret certain descriptions in light of contemporary understanding

## Ethical Implications

Belief in the Day of Judgment has profound ethical implications:

* **Accountability**: Actions have consequences beyond this life
* **Justice**: Ultimate redress for worldly injustices
* **Purpose**: Life is a test with eternal significance
* **Perspective**: Worldly pleasures and hardships are temporary
* **Humility**: Recognition of human dependency on divine mercy
* **Hope**: Divine mercy offers possibility of salvation despite human failings
* **Balance**: Encourages neither despair nor presumption

## Common Misconceptions

Several misunderstandings exist regarding the Islamic concept of Judgment:

* **Predetermination**: Mistaken belief that judgment is arbitrary rather than based on free choices
* **Physical Impossibility**: Questioning resurrection based on material limitations
* **Immediate Judgment**: Confusion between immediate afterlife experience (Barzakh) and final judgment
* **Purely Symbolic**: Treating descriptions as merely metaphorical rather than real events
* **Severity Without Mercy**: Overlooking the extensive emphasis on divine mercy and forgiveness

## Contemporary Relevance

The concept of Judgment Day remains central to Muslim life:

* Provides ethical framework in secular age
* Offers consolation amid worldly injustices
* Creates perspective during trials and tribulations
* Motivates charitable works and social responsibility
* Informs daily prayer content and religious discourse

## Comparative Perspectives

While unique in specifics, Islamic eschatology shares themes with other traditions:

* **Judaism**: Comparable concepts of resurrection and divine judgment
* **Christianity**: Similar emphasis on final judgment and afterlife, with theological differences
* **Zoroastrianism**: Parallel ideas of cosmic renewal and moral accountability
* **Hindu**: Different metaphysics but comparable concepts of karmic consequences
