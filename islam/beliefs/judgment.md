# The Day of Judgment in Islam

![Representation of divine scales and judgment](judgment.jpg)

In Islamic theology, the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyāmah or Yawm al-Dīn) represents the culmination of human existence and the ultimate manifestation of divine justice. This momentous event marks the time when all souls who have ever lived will be resurrected, assembled before Allah, and held accountable for their beliefs and actions during earthly life. Central to Islamic eschatology, the belief in divine judgment is one of the six articles of faith and features prominently throughout the Quran and prophetic traditions. The Day of Judgment is characterized by perfect divine justice where every deed, intention, and thought—no matter how seemingly insignificant—will be weighed with absolute precision. Islamic teachings describe this day as both terrifying for the unrighteous and a time of vindication and reward for the believers who remained faithful to Allah's commands. The comprehensive nature of this judgment, its fairness, and its inevitability serve as powerful motivations for ethical conduct and spiritual mindfulness in Islamic religious life.
