# Jibril (Gabriel)

![Artistic representation of Angel Jibril](jibril.jpg)

Jibril (Gabriel) is one of the most significant angels in Islamic belief, revered as the Angel of Revelation who transmitted the divine message from Allah to the Prophet Muhammad. As the primary intermediary between the divine and human realms, Jibril holds an exalted position in Islamic angelology and salvation history. While not depicted physically in Islamic art due to prohibitions against portraying spiritual beings, Jibril's role and importance are extensively documented in Islamic scriptures and traditions.

## Etymology and Names

The name Jibril (جبريل) can be pronounced in several ways in Arabic: Jibril, Jibreel, Jabrail, Jabraeel, or Jabreel. The traditional interpretation suggests that the name consists of two parts:

1. **Jibr/Jabr** - Traditionally understood to mean "servant" or "slave" (making Jibril mean "Servant of Allah"). However, when studying the root of "Jibr," it comes from "Jabar," meaning strength, which aligns with Allah's description of Jibril as possessing "mighty strength."
2. **Il/El** - Referring to Allah, God

The Quran and hadith refer to Jibril through various titles:
- **Ruh al-Qudus** (The Holy Spirit)
- **Ar-Ruh al-Amin** (The Trustworthy Spirit)
- **Ruhuna** (Our Spirit) - a form of veneration from Allah
- **Shadid al-Quwa** (One of Mighty Strength)
- **An-Namus** (Bearer of Divine Secrets) - as described by Waraqah ibn Nawfal
- **Rasul Karim** (Noble Messenger)

Notably, the title "An-Namus" derives from an interesting linguistic root: while "jasoos" means a spy carrying evil secrets, "namus" refers to someone who carries beautiful secrets, in Jibril's case, the secrets of divine revelation.

Sometimes the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ referred to Jibril simply as "the one who is with my Lord," indicating his proximity to Allah. On occasions, the Prophet ﷺ would even say "Jibril, sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam" (peace be upon him), invoking blessings upon him just as he would for Ibrahim (Abraham), demonstrating Jibril's elevated status.

## Quranic References

The Quran mentions Jibril explicitly by name and through descriptions:

- "Say, 'Whoever is an enemy to Jibril - it is he who has brought it [the Quran] down upon your heart, by permission of Allah'" (2:97)
- "He [the Prophet] was taught by one mighty in power [Jibril], endowed with wisdom" (53:5-6)
- "The faithful Spirit [Jibril] has brought it down upon your heart" (26:193-194)
- "We supported him [Jesus] with the Holy Spirit [Jibril]" (2:87)
- "He [Allah] sends down the angels with the Spirit [Jibril] of His command upon whom He wills of His servants" (16:2)

## Creation and Status

According to Islamic tradition, Jibril is believed to be the first creation of Allah to be given a soul. When created, his first words were "La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah" (There is no power or might except with Allah). This declaration signals his absolute submission to Allah's will from the moment of his creation.

Jibril belongs to the most elite class of angels known as "al-Mala'ikah al-Muqasimat al-Amr" (Those who apportion the command of Allah). This group includes four primary angels:

1. **Jibril** - Through whom comes spiritual life (revelation)
2. **Mikail** (Michael) - In charge of physical provision (rain, sustenance)
3. **Israfil** - Responsible for blowing the trumpet on the Day of Judgment
4. **Malak al-Mawt** (Angel of Death) - Takes souls individually

Among these, Jibril holds the highest position and is the only one Allah communicates with directly, who then relays messages to other angels. While Allah may speak directly to the other three angels of this elite class, Allah always speaks to Jibril directly, whereas Jibril may be sent to communicate with the other angels.

## The Heavens and Angels

The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ described the heavens as "creaking" - shaking violently because there isn't a space of four fingers except that there is an angel in prostration to Allah, declaring His praises. This imagery conveys the vast number of angels that populate the heavens.

In comparing the number of angels to the number of jinn (another unseen creation), the angels vastly outnumber the jinn and devils. This is a source of reassurance for believers who might worry about evil forces, as the benevolent angels are far more numerous.

Modern scientific recordings from outer space have captured sounds that researchers have described as resembling "a billion men doing Gregorian chants simultaneously." Some scholars have noted the similarity between this description and the Prophet's ﷺ statement about what he heard during his Night Journey: "I see things that you are incapable of seeing, and I hear things that you are incapable of hearing."

## Role as the Angel of Revelation

Jibril's primary function in Islamic tradition is as the bearer of divine revelation:

1. **Transmitter of the Quran** - Conveyed Allah's words to Muhammad over a 23-year period
2. **Method of Revelation** - Sometimes appeared in angelic form, sometimes communicated invisibly, and sometimes came in the form of ringing bells
3. **First Revelation** - Brought the initial Quranic verses beginning with "Iqra" (Read/Recite) in Cave Hira
4. **Preservation** - Helped the Prophet memorize and maintain the textual integrity of the revelation
5. **Annual Review** - According to tradition, reviewed the entire Quran with Muhammad each Ramadan
6. **Physical Impact** - The revelation process was physically intense, causing the Prophet to sweat even in cold weather

When bringing revelation, Jibril would be accompanied by 70,000 angels, creating a sound described as like "the creaking of the heavens." The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ described how the heavens were creaking (shaking violently) because there isn't a space of four fingers except that there is an angel in prostration to Allah, declaring His praises.

According to authentic narrations, Jibril taught the Prophet different modes of recitation of the Quran (qira'at). Initially, Jibril taught one mode, but the Prophet requested more to make it easier for his community. Jibril would sit on the Prophet's right side while Mikail would sit on his left as he learned these recitation styles, increasing until seven modes of recitation were established.

## Attributes and Description

Islamic tradition describes Jibril with these characteristics:

- **Majestic Appearance** - Described as having 600 wings that can fill the entire horizon
- **Immense Size** - Traditions suggest his form is so vast that the distance between his earlobe and shoulder is a journey of 700 years
- **Luminous Nature** - Created from light (nur), the most noble of Allah's creations, unlike in some other traditions where angels are described as being created from fire
- **Mighty Power** - Described as extremely strong and commanding, able to destroy nations with one wing
- **Swift Movement** - Able to travel instantly between heaven and earth
- **Beautiful Voice** - Traditions mention his melodious delivery of revelation
- **Physical Details** - Wings of green color with pearls and rubies constantly falling from them
- **Human Form** - When appearing in human form to the Prophet Muhammad, he resembled Dihya al-Kalbi, described as the most handsome man among the Arabs

Unlike the portrayal of angels in other traditions as small beings with two wings, Islamic descriptions emphasize Jibril's majestic and awe-inspiring presence. In one hadith, the Prophet ﷺ described seeing Jibril in his full angelic form twice: once at the beginning of his prophethood and once during the Night Journey (al-Isra wal Mi'raj). During these encounters, Jibril filled the entire horizon with his 600 wings spread out, sitting upon a throne provided for him by Allah, with constant rubies and pearls falling from his wings.

Regarding Jibril's size, this corresponds to the magnitude of his responsibilities—the greater an angel's task, the greater its size. Since Jibril has the greatest of tasks (bringing revelation), he is considered the largest and most magnificent of the angels.

An average angel, by comparison, is described in narrations as being the size of mountains. Sufyan ibn Uyana narrated that when a person enters into prayer, angels the size of mountains join in prayer with them, even when one thinks they are alone.

## Character and Qualities

Jibril exhibits several notable character traits:

- **Modesty** - Described as being exceedingly modest, refusing to enter places where people are not properly dressed. There are narrations where Jibril would not enter the home of the Prophet ﷺ if someone was not appropriately covered.
- **Love for Believers** - Shows compassion and concern for the fate of humanity even before humans were created. In a hadith, when Allah created Paradise and Hellfire and sent Jibril to look at them, Jibril first expressed joy that everyone would want to enter Paradise upon hearing about it, and then showed concern that no one would be saved from Hellfire, demonstrating his care for the future human race.
- **Obedience** - Perfectly obedient to Allah, never questioning divine commands
- **Hatred of Disbelief** - Particularly despised Pharaoh for claiming divinity. In a hadith, Jibril told the Prophet that he hated Pharaoh from the moment he heard him say, "I am your lord, the most high."
- **Trustworthiness** - Described as "Amin" (trustworthy), similar to the Prophet Muhammad's attribute
- **Respected Leader** - Beloved and respected by other angels who follow him without question

## First Experiences of Jibril with the Divine Creation

According to authentic hadith, when Allah first created Paradise and Hellfire, He sent Jibril to examine them:

1. **First Visit to Paradise** - When Jibril first saw Paradise, he returned to Allah and exclaimed: "By Your glory, no one who hears about this place will fail to enter it!" Allah then surrounded Paradise with difficulties and hardships.

2. **Second Visit to Paradise** - After seeing Paradise surrounded with hardships, Jibril returned concerned, saying: "By Your glory, I now fear that no one will be able to enter it."

3. **First Visit to Hellfire** - Upon seeing Hellfire, Jibril returned to Allah saying: "By Your glory, no one who hears about this place will enter it."

4. **Second Visit to Hellfire** - Allah surrounded Hellfire with desires and ease, and when Jibril returned, he said: "By Your glory, now I fear that no one will be safe from it."

To reassure Jibril, Allah revealed: "The believers have succeeded—those who have humility in their prayers," indicating that despite the trials and temptations of the world, sincere believers would attain salvation.

## Key Encounters with Prophets

Jibril interacted with numerous prophets throughout sacred history:

### Adam (Adam)

- Possibly the angel that gathered the soil for Adam's creation
- After Adam's expulsion from Paradise, Jibril became the intermediary between Allah and Adam, as Allah no longer spoke to Adam directly
- Taught Adam after his descent to Earth

### Idris (Enoch)

- Accompanied him to the heavens where he met the Angel of Death in the fourth heaven
- According to traditions strengthened by authentic reports, Idris was taken up by Jibril and died in the fourth heaven, which is why the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ met him in the fourth heaven during the Night Journey
- The interpretation of "We raised him to a high position" (Quran 19:57) refers to Idris being taken to the fourth heaven

### Ibrahim (Abraham)

- When Ibrahim was thrown into the fire, Jibril came to him and asked if he needed help. Ibrahim replied, "If it's from you, I don't want anything, but if it's from Allah, then I accept." This was the first instance of "Hasbunallah wa ni'mal wakeel" (Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs)
- Created the well of Zamzam by striking the ground with his heel when Hajar and Ismail were in the desert. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ mentioned that this small well (just 8 by 3 meters) produces 8,000 liters per second (691 million liters per day) and has never dried up since that moment, a continuous miracle from Jibril's intervention
- Came with other angels to announce the birth of Ishaq (Isaac) to Ibrahim and Sarah
- Taught Ibrahim the rituals of Hajj, instructing him on every aspect, including to stone the Devil (which is commemorated in the ritual of stoning during Hajj)

### Lut (Lot)

- Was sent alongside other angels to destroy the people of Lut after they rejected their prophet
- According to tradition, lifted their entire city with the tip of one of his wings and then destroyed them

### Musa (Moses)

- Provided assistance during confrontations with Pharaoh 
- According to an authentic hadith, when Pharaoh was drowning and about to declare faith, Jibril took dirt and put it in his mouth, fearing that Allah might forgive him if he sincerely repented. Allah later told Jibril that even if Pharaoh had sincerely sought forgiveness, He would have forgiven him
- This story reveals Jibril's deep hatred for those who claim divinity, as he told the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ: "I hated him from the day I heard him say 'I am your lord, the most high.'"
- It also demonstrates Jibril's understanding of Allah's boundless mercy, knowing that even Pharaoh could be forgiven if he sincerely repented

### Yusuf (Joseph)

- Though not prominently mentioned in the story of Yusuf, there are narrations suggesting that when Yusuf's brothers threw him into the well, Jibril was there to catch him and ensure his fall wasn't too harsh
- This subtle presence illustrates an important spiritual principle: "The creation never cuts the ropes except that the Creator catches you"—Allah does not let believers go to waste

### Maryam (Mary)

- Announced the miraculous birth of Isa (Jesus)
- Initially appeared to her in perfect human form, causing her to seek refuge from him. When she said "I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you if you have any fear of Allah," he assumed an angelic form and continued the conversation
- Comforted her during childbirth, telling her not to grieve and instructing her to shake the palm tree for dates
- Guided her on how to respond when questioned about her child
- Coached her through the difficult period of pregnancy and birth, reassuring her of Allah's plan

### Isa (Jesus)

- Supported him throughout his ministry as mentioned in the Quran: "We supported him with the Holy Spirit"
- Took him to heaven when there was a plot to crucify him, as Jibril is the only angel capable of taking prophets through the heavenly realms

## First Encounter with Prophet Muhammad

The first revelation experience occurred when Muhammad was 40 years old, meditating in Cave Hira:

1. The Prophet ﷺ had been experiencing truthful dreams for six months as an initial stage of revelation 
2. He developed a love for solitude and would retreat to Cave Hira for extended periods of worship
3. Jibril appeared and commanded him to "Read!"
4. When the Prophet replied he could not read, Jibril embraced him tightly three times
5. Then revealed the first verses: "Read in the name of your Lord who created, created man from a clinging substance. Read, and your Lord is the most Generous, who taught by the pen, taught man that which he knew not."
6. The Prophet returned home terrified and asked his wife Khadija to cover him
7. When the Prophet told Khadija what happened, she took him to her cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal, who confirmed that this was the same "Namus" (bearer of divine secrets) sent to Moses

After this initial revelation, there was a pause called the "Fatrah" before revelations resumed. During this period, the Prophet would often hear Jibril's voice but not see him. When revelations resumed, Jibril appeared in his full angelic form spanning the horizon.

## The Physical Nature of Revelation

The process of receiving revelation through Jibril had profound physical effects on the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:

1. **Intense Physical Experience** - The revelation would come with great pressure, described like "the ringing of a bell," which was the most difficult form for the Prophet
2. **Bodily Reactions** - The Prophet would sweat profusely even on very cold days
3. **Weight** - If the Prophet was riding a camel when revelation came, the camel would be forced to sit due to the weight of the revelation
4. **Sound** - Companions described hearing a humming sound like bees near the Prophet's face when revelation came
5. **Facial Changes** - The Prophet's face would change color during revelation

According to authentic reports, Jibril would be accompanied by 70,000 angels when bringing revelation, creating a sound like the creaking of the heavens. When Allah finished speaking the revelation to Jibril, the angels would fall into prostration, saying "Our Lord has spoken the truth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great."

## The Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj)

Jibril played a pivotal role in the Prophet Muhammad's miraculous night journey:

- **Guide on the Journey** - Led Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem and through the seven heavens
- **Interpreter** - Explained heavenly phenomena and introduced the Prophet to earlier prophets
- **Facilitator** - Enabled Muhammad's audience with Allah beyond the Lote Tree (Sidrat al-Muntaha)
- **Instructor** - Helped institute the five daily prayers during this journey

During this journey, the Prophet met various prophets in different heavens:
- Adam in the first heaven
- Yahya (John) and Isa (Jesus) in the second heaven
- Yusuf (Joseph) in the third heaven
- Idris in the fourth heaven
- Harun (Aaron) in the fifth heaven 
- Musa (Moses) in the sixth heaven
- Ibrahim (Abraham) in the seventh heaven

The Prophet ﷺ also saw Jibril in his true form with 600 wings near the Lote Tree (Sidrat al-Muntaha). When the Prophet observed Paradise, Jibril explained that a palace made of pearls with no dust was prepared for him.

Notably, during this journey, when the Prophet reached a certain point, Jibril stopped and said he could go no further, while the Prophet was allowed to proceed. This demonstrates that despite Jibril's exalted status, there are limits to where even he can travel in the spiritual realms.

## Teaching Role

Beyond delivering revelation, Jibril served as a teacher to the Prophet and his community:

1. **The Hadith of Jibril** - In a famous incident, Jibril appeared as a man in clean white clothes with intensely black hair. He approached the Prophet in front of his companions and sat knee to knee with him, placing his hands on the Prophet's thighs. He then proceeded to ask questions about Islam, Iman (faith), and Ihsan (excellence), providing the foundational understanding of these three levels of religion. After the man left, the Prophet informed his companions that this was Jibril who had come to teach them their religion.

2. **Religious Instruction** - Taught the method of prayer, including the times and movements. When prayer was first prescribed during the Night Journey, Jibril came to the Prophet at the beginning of each prayer time to demonstrate when and how to pray.

3. **Moral Guidance** - Provided advice and counsel in various situations, including explaining aspects of the unseen world

4. **Spiritual Support** - Offered reassurance during times of hardship, such as after the rejection at Ta'if when the Prophet ﷺ was injured and distraught, Jibril came with the Angel of Mountains offering to crush the city between two mountains if the Prophet wished

## Support in Battle and Difficult Times

Jibril provided various forms of support to Muhammad beyond delivering revelation:

1. **Battle of Badr** - Jibril and thousands of angels participated in the Battle of Badr, fighting alongside the Muslims. The Prophet ﷺ described seeing Jibril on a horse, leading the angelic forces.

2. **Protection from Magic** - When the Prophet was affected by black magic, Jibril came to inform him about it and guided him to where the magical items were hidden, then taught him the two chapters of protection (Al-Mu'awwidhatayn: Surah Al-Falaq and Surah An-Nas) to break the spell.

3. **Emotional Support** - After the Prophet was rejected and physically attacked at Ta'if, Jibril brought the Angel of Mountains who offered to crush the city, but the Prophet chose mercy instead.

4. **Migration Guidance** - Directed the Prophet on when and how to migrate to Medina, warning him of an assassination plot in Mecca.

5. **Advising about Hypocrites** - Informed the Prophet about the actions and intentions of the hypocrites in Medina.

## Special Instances of Jibril's Appearance to the Companions

1. **The Hadith of Jibril** - As mentioned earlier, Jibril appeared in human form before many companions, asking the Prophet about Islam, Iman, and Ihsan.

2. **Appearance as Dihya al-Kalbi** - On several occasions, companions saw Jibril in the form of Dihya al-Kalbi, who was known as the "Yusuf (Joseph) of the Arabs" for his exceptional handsomeness. Umm Salamah once saw him speaking with the Prophet and thought he was Dihya, only to learn later it was Jibril.

3. **Battle Appearances** - During battles, some companions reported seeing unknown men fighting alongside them, later identified as angels led by Jibril.

## The Story of the First Revelation in Detail

The full account of the first revelation provides deeper insight into Jibril's interaction with the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:

When the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was 40 years old, he began to love solitude. He would leave his home and spend extended periods in Cave Hira, engaging in worship and contemplation. For six months before the first revelation, he experienced truthful dreams — whatever he saw in his dreams would come to pass exactly as he had seen them.

One night, as he was meditating in the cave, Jibril appeared to him. The Prophet ﷺ later described how Jibril embraced him so tightly that he thought he would die. Jibril commanded, "Read!" The Prophet replied, "I cannot read." This happened three times, with Jibril embracing him tightly each time. Finally, the Prophet asked, "What should I read?" Then Jibril recited the first verses of what would become Surah Al-Alaq:

"Read in the name of your Lord who created, created man from a clinging substance. Read, and your Lord is the most Generous, who taught by the pen, taught man that which he knew not."

The Prophet ﷺ returned home trembling, saying to his wife Khadija, "Cover me, cover me!" Once he had calmed down, he recounted his experience to her. Khadija responded with unwavering support, saying, "By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You uphold the ties of kinship, speak truthfully, help the poor, serve your guests generously, and assist those who are stricken by calamity."

Khadija then took the Prophet ﷺ to her cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal, who had knowledge of previous scriptures. Upon hearing the account, Waraqah exclaimed, "This is the same Namus (bearer of divine secrets) that Allah sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live until the time when your people will drive you out!" The Prophet ﷺ asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqah confirmed, "Yes. Never has a man brought what you have brought except that he was treated with hostility."

After this first revelation, there was a pause (fatrah) in revelation. During this time, the Prophet ﷺ was deeply distressed, even contemplating throwing himself from mountain peaks. But whenever he reached the summit, Jibril would appear to him saying, "O Muhammad, you are truly the Messenger of Allah." This would comfort him, but as soon as the experience ended and he returned home, the distress would return.

Eventually, as he was walking one day, he heard a voice from the sky. Looking up, he saw Jibril sitting on a chair between heaven and earth. The Prophet ﷺ was terrified and rushed home, asking to be covered again. It was then that Allah revealed the beginning of Surah Al-Muddathir: "O you who covers himself [with a garment], arise and warn."

From this point onwards, revelation continued regularly until the end of the Prophet's life.

## Annual Quranic Review

Each Ramadan, Jibril would come to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to review the Quran that had been revealed thus far:

1. **Complete Recitation** - They would recite the entire Quran to each other
2. **Final Year** - In the last year of the Prophet's life, they reviewed the Quran twice, indicating the completion of revelation
3. **Establishing Tradition** - This practice established the tradition of completing the Quran during Ramadan

During these reviews, Jibril would sit on the Prophet's right side while Mikail would sit on his left. The review process served multiple purposes: confirming the accuracy of the revelation, ensuring the proper sequence of chapters and verses, and providing an opportunity for deep reflection on the meanings of the sacred text.

## Jibril's Protection of the Prophet During Childhood

According to narrations, Jibril's connection with the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ began even in his childhood:

When the Prophet ﷺ was a young boy playing with other children, Jibril appeared, took him aside, and opened his chest. He removed the Prophet's heart, extracted a black spot from it (representing the portion of evil), and washed it in a golden basin with Zamzam water. He then returned the heart to the Prophet's chest.

The other children ran to the Prophet's wet nurse, saying, "Muhammad has been killed!" When they came to him, they found him alive but pale. Some narrations mention that the Prophet ﷺ later said, "I saw the mark of that stitching on my chest."

This purification symbolized the Prophet's special preparation for receiving divine revelation and highlighted Jibril's role as a protector and purifier.

## Comparison with Other Traditions

Jibril/Gabriel appears in multiple religious traditions with notable differences:

- **Judaism** - One of four archangels, associated with judgment and strength
- **Christianity** - Announced births of John the Baptist and Jesus; less prominent post-biblical role
- **Islam** - Primary angel of revelation; continuing interaction with Muhammad throughout his prophethood

In Judeo-Christian traditions, angels are sometimes depicted as being capable of falling, created from fire, and portrayed as small beings with two wings. In contrast, Islamic tradition describes angels, especially Jibril, as infallible beings created from light, with multiple wings and magnificent size.

## Theological Significance

Jibril's role has important theological dimensions:

1. **Divine Transcendence** - Demonstrates how Allah communicates with humanity through intermediaries
2. **Scriptural Authenticity** - His role validates the divine origin of the Quran
3. **Prophetic Authority** - Confirms Muhammad's status as recipient of revelation
4. **Pillar of Faith** - Belief in angels (particularly Jibril) is the second pillar of Islamic faith because it establishes the integrity of the revelatory process
5. **Angelology** - Exemplifies the Islamic understanding of angels as obedient servants of Allah
6. **Continuity of Revelation** - Links the Quran to previous divine messages

## Cultural Impact

References to Jibril appear throughout Islamic culture:

- **Poetry and Literature** - Featured in devotional and mystical works
- **Religious Ceremonies** - Invoked in prayers related to knowledge and revelation
- **Names** - "Jibreel/Gabriel" remains a popular name in Muslim communities
- **Symbolic Representations** - Sometimes represented through calligraphy or abstract designs
- **Supplications** - The Prophet taught specific prayers asking for protection through Jibril

## Death and the Angel Jibril

Unlike humans, angels do not die except at the end of the world. According to Islamic eschatology:

1. When the end of the world approaches, all angels including Jibril will be required to taste death
2. Jibril will be among the last beings to die before the resurrection
3. His death signifies the complete end of the worldly order before the new creation begins

## Important Lessons from the Life of Jibril

1. **Absolute Obedience** - Jibril exemplifies perfect submission to Allah's commands without question
2. **Excellence in Duty** - His meticulousness in conveying revelation teaches the importance of precision in religious matters
3. **Balancing Fear and Hope** - His concern about Paradise and Hellfire demonstrates the Islamic middle path of fearing Allah's punishment while hoping for His mercy
4. **Humility Despite Status** - Despite his exalted position, Jibril remains completely humble before Allah
5. **Respect for Knowledge** - His role in teaching prophets and delivering revelation highlights the honor of knowledge in Islam

## The Wisdom Behind Belief in Angels

The belief in angels, with Jibril being central to this belief, constitutes the second pillar of Islamic faith. This is primarily because the integrity of the message depends on the integrity of the messenger. By establishing the existence and nature of Jibril, Islam clarifies the precise mechanism through which divine revelation passes from Allah to humanity.

Unlike in some other theological traditions where angels can fall from grace or make errors, Islamic theology presents angels as infallible beings who carry out divine commands perfectly. This establishes the unbroken chain of revelation: from Allah to Jibril to the Prophet ﷺ to the believers.
