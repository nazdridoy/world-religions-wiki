# Divine Justice ('Adl) in Islam

![Illustration representing divine scales of justice](adl.jpg)

In Islamic theology, Divine Justice ('Adl) refers to Allah's absolute fairness, impartiality, and equitability in all affairs. As one of Allah's essential attributes, 'Adl establishes that God is completely just in His dealings with creation, neither oppressing anyone nor allowing ultimate injustice to prevail. This concept holds particular importance in Islamic theological discourse, especially regarding divine decree, human accountability, and eschatology. While 'Adl is intrinsically connected to divine omnipotence, Islamic theology maintains that Allah's justice operates within His wisdom, mercy, and knowledge, representing perfect balance rather than mere mechanical equity. The understanding of Divine Justice varies somewhat across Islamic theological schools, with some elevating it to a fundamental principle of faith, while others subsume it under broader divine attributes.
