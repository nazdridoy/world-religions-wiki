# Signs of the End Times in Islamic Eschatology

![Illustration representing the Day of Judgment](signs_end_times.jpg)

In Islamic eschatology, the Final Hour (al-Sā'ah) and the events leading up to it form a central aspect of faith. Islamic tradition describes numerous signs that will precede the Day of Judgment, ranging from moral and social deterioration to cosmic and supernatural events. These signs are typically categorized as Minor Signs (al-'Alāmāt al-Sughrā), which are more subtle indications that may occur over an extended period, and Major Signs (al-'Alāmāt al-Kubrā), which are extraordinary events that will unfold in relatively quick succession near the actual end of the world. This detailed prophetic framework serves multiple purposes: it provides believers with warnings about moral decline, offers hope through promises of eventual divine justice, establishes ethical imperatives through eschatological accountability, and creates a comprehensive meaning-making system that places current events within a larger divine plan. While interpretations vary across different Islamic traditions, the core narrative remains a fundamental aspect of Islamic belief about the ultimate destiny of humanity and the world.

## Quranic Foundation

### Direct References to the Final Hour

* "They ask you, [O Muhammad], about the Hour: when is its arrival? Say, 'Its knowledge is only with my Lord. None will reveal its time except Him. It lays heavily upon the heavens and the earth. It will not come upon you except unexpectedly.' They ask you as if you are familiar with it. Say, 'Its knowledge is only with Allah, but most of the people do not know.'" (Quran 7:187)

* "People ask you concerning the Hour. Say, 'Knowledge of it is only with Allah. And what may make you perceive? Perhaps the Hour is near.'" (Quran 33:63)
