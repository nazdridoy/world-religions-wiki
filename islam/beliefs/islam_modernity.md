The relationship between Islam and modernity represents one of the most significant theological, intellectual, and sociopolitical challenges facing Muslim communities worldwide. This multifaceted engagement encompasses efforts to reconcile traditional Islamic beliefs and practices with modern values, institutions, and epistemologies that emerged primarily from Western Enlightenment thinking. From the colonial period to contemporary globalization, Muslims have developed diverse responses to modernityâ€”ranging from selective adaptation and reformist integration to traditionalist preservation and revivalist critique.
