# Resurrection (البعث)

![Illustration depicting the Islamic concept of resurrection](resurrection.jpg)

Resurrection (al-ba'th) is a fundamental belief in Islamic theology, referring to the reconstitution of human bodies and souls after death on the Day of Judgment. This essential doctrine affirms that all humans will be raised from their graves, restored to physical existence, and assembled before Allah for final judgment. The resurrection represents the ultimate manifestation of divine power and justice, where every person will be held accountable for their earthly actions. As one of the six articles of faith in Islam, belief in resurrection underscores the temporary nature of worldly existence and emphasizes the eternal significance of moral choices made during one's lifetime, providing both a powerful incentive for righteous conduct and hope for ultimate justice in the divine court.

## Quranic Foundation

The concept of resurrection is extensively addressed in the Quran through numerous verses:

### Explicit Affirmations

* "And among His Signs is that you see the earth barren, but when We send down rain to it, it is stirred to life and yields increase. Verily, He Who gives life to the dead earth can surely give life to dead men" (41:39)
* "Does man think that We cannot assemble his bones? Nay, We are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers" (75:3-4)
* "And he presents for Us an example and forgets his own creation, saying, 'Who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated?' Say, 'He will give them life who produced them the first time; and He is, of all creation, Knowing'" (36:78-79)
* "O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily We have created you from dust, then from a drop of seed..." (22:5)

### Analogies and Arguments
