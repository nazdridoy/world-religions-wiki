# Previous Scriptures (الكتب السابقة)

![Ancient sacred texts in Islamic tradition](previous_scriptures.jpg)

In Islamic theology, previous scriptures refer to the divine revelations that Allah sent to various prophets before Muhammad. The Quran affirms the existence of earlier revelations as part of God's ongoing guidance to humanity and acknowledges them as originally authentic divine texts. However, Islamic doctrine maintains that these scriptures, while originally containing God's pure message, underwent human alterations over time. This concept establishes continuity with earlier monotheistic traditions while explaining perceived discrepancies between Islamic teachings and contemporary Jewish and Christian scriptures.

## Quranic Foundation

The Quran explicitly mentions several earlier scriptures and affirms their divine origin:

> "Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light." (Quran 5:44)

> "And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus son of Mary, confirming the Torah that came before him. And We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light, confirming the Torah that came before it, and as guidance and admonition for the righteous." (Quran 5:46)

> "And We have revealed to you [O Muhammad] the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it." (Quran 5:48)

These references establish a theological framework in which Allah has provided consistent divine guidance through multiple revelations.

## Major Previous Scriptures

### Torah (التوراة - Tawrat)

* Revealed to Prophet Moses (Musa) on Mount Sinai
* Contains divine law and guidance for the Children of Israel
* Corresponds broadly to the Pentateuch (first five books of the Hebrew Bible)
* Held in high esteem in Islamic tradition as a divine revelation
* Mentioned 18 times in the Quran

> "And We gave Moses the Scripture, after We had destroyed the former generations, as enlightenment for the people and guidance and mercy that they might be reminded." (Quran 28:43)

### Psalms (الزبور - Zabur)

* Revealed to Prophet David (Dawud)
* Consists primarily of devotional and praising material
* Corresponds broadly to the Biblical Psalms
* Mentioned three times in the Quran

> "And We gave David the Zabur [Psalms]." (Quran 17:55)

### Gospel (الإنجيل - Injil)

* Revealed to Prophet Jesus (Isa)
* Contains guidance and wisdom for the followers of Jesus
* In Islamic understanding, not identical to the four canonical gospels but a single revelation
* Mentioned 12 times in the Quran

> "And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Torah that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Torah that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah." (Quran 5:46)

### Scrolls of Abraham (صحف إبراهيم - Suhuf Ibrahim)

* Revealed to Prophet Abraham (Ibrahim)
* Not extant even in Muhammad's time
* Mentioned in conjunction with the Scrolls of Moses
* Content not detailed in the Quran

> "Indeed, this is in the former scriptures, the scriptures of Abraham and Moses." (Quran 87:18-19)

### Scrolls of Moses (صحف موسى - Suhuf Musa)

* Distinct from the Torah
* Additional revelation given to Moses
* Content not specified in detail
* Mentioned alongside the Scrolls of Abraham

## Islamic Understanding of Previous Scriptures

### Original Authenticity

Islam affirms that:
* All previous scriptures originated as genuine divine revelations
* They contained the same essential monotheistic message
* Their original forms were in complete harmony with the Quran
* They came from the same divine source
* They formed part of Allah's progressive revelation to humanity

### Concept of Tahrif (تحريف - Alteration)

Islamic theology holds that previous scriptures underwent corruption through:

* **Tahrif al-Ma'ani** (Distortion of meaning): Misinterpretation of authentic text
* **Tahrif al-Nass** (Distortion of text): Actual changes to the scriptural text
* Deliberate or inadvertent changes during transcription and translation
* Addition of human elements to divine revelation
* Omission of prophecies regarding Muhammad's coming
* Loss of portions of the original revelation

> "So woe to those who write the scripture with their own hands, then say, 'This is from Allah,' in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn." (Quran 2:79)

### Reasons for Subsequent Revelations

Islamic theology explains that new revelations were needed because:
* Previous communities failed to preserve their scriptures intact
* Divine guidance needed renewal and reinforcement
* Specific guidance was required for new historical contexts
* Progressive revelation culminated in the final, universal message of the Quran

## Historical Engagement with Previous Scriptures

### Early Islamic Period

* Muslims showed respect for "People of the Book" and their scriptures
* Some companions reported traditions from Jewish and Christian sources (Isra'iliyyat)
* Limited direct interaction with the textual content of previous scriptures
* Focus on the Quran as the criterion for evaluating other traditions

### Medieval Scholarship

* Ibn Hazm (d. 1064) conducted critical analysis of Biblical texts
* Al-Biruni (d. 1048) engaged in comparative religious study
* Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328) developed detailed critique of textual corruption
* Translation of Biblical materials into Arabic increased

### Modern Approaches

* Increased academic study of Biblical criticism by Muslim scholars
* Comparative textual analysis between Quranic and Biblical narratives
* Engagement with modern historical-critical scholarship
* Interfaith dialogue around scriptural interpretations
* Scientific analysis of manuscript traditions

## Theological Implications

The Islamic view of previous scriptures has several theological consequences:

1. **Continuity**: Islam presents itself as a continuation of the same monotheistic tradition
2. **Universality**: Affirms that Allah has sent guidance to all peoples
3. **Finality**: Establishes the Quran as the final, incorruptible revelation
4. **Criterion**: Positions the Quran as the measure to discern truth in earlier texts
5. **Supersession**: Later revelations take precedence over earlier ones

## Contemporary Relevance

### Interfaith Dialogue

* Provides common scriptural ground for dialogue with Jews and Christians
* Creates theological framework for recognizing shared prophetic figures
* Acknowledges partial validity while maintaining distinctive Islamic perspective
* Offers basis for comparative scriptural studies

### Apologetics

* Muslim scholars use the concept to explain discrepancies with Jewish/Christian texts
* Appeals to textual criticism to support claims of alteration
* Identification of alleged prophecies about Muhammad in extant scriptures
* Analysis of internal contradictions as evidence of human intervention
