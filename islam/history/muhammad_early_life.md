# Early Life of Prophet Muhammad

![Muhammad's Early Life](../../images/muhammad_early_life.jpg)

The early life of Prophet Muhammad (c. 570-610 CE) provides crucial historical context for understanding the emergence of Islam. Born into the influential Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca, Muhammad's formative years were marked by personal hardship, mercantile experience, and spiritual seeking. Though historical accounts of this period are filtered through later Islamic tradition and hagiography, they offer valuable insights into the social, economic, religious, and political environment that shaped the man who would eventually proclaim a new monotheistic faith. His early experiences—from childhood orphanhood to commercial journeys across Arabia to contemplative retreats—established the foundation for his later prophetic mission.

## Birth and Lineage

Muhammad was born into a significant Meccan family with a complex social position:

- **Date of Birth**: Traditionally cited as "Year of the Elephant" (c. 570 CE), referring to Abraha's expedition against the Kaaba
- **Family Heritage**: Born into the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe, custodians of the Kaaba but not the wealthiest Meccan clan
- **Parents**: Son of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb, both from respected lineages
- **Ancestral Legacy**: Great-grandson of Qusai ibn Kilab, who had consolidated control of the Kaaba
- **Orphanhood**: Father died before his birth, and his mother died when he was six years old
- **Genealogical Significance**: Later Islamic tradition traced his lineage to Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) through Isma'il (Ishmael)

## Childhood and Youth

Muhammad's early years were shaped by Meccan customs and personal loss:

- **Fosterage**: According to tradition, sent to the desert to be nursed by Halima al-Sa'diyya from the Banu Sa'd tribe
- **The "Opening of the Chest"**: Traditional account of angels purifying his heart during his time with Halima
- **Return to Mecca**: Brought back to his mother Amina around age five or six
- **Mother's Death**: Loss of his mother Amina during a journey to Yathrib (later Medina) when he was six
- **Grandfather's Guardianship**: Taken in by his grandfather Abd al-Muttalib, a prominent Meccan elder
- **Abu Talib's Protection**: After his grandfather's death two years later, raised by his uncle Abu Talib, leader of Banu Hashim
- **Early Work**: Served as a shepherd boy, an experience he later recalled with fondness
- **Education**: Likely received no formal education, remaining illiterate according to tradition

## Meccan Society and Religious Environment

The cultural context of Muhammad's youth shaped his religious awareness:

- **The Kaaba**: Center of Meccan religious life with its multiple deities and tribal significance
- **Pre-Islamic Polytheism**: Exposure to Arabian paganism with its pantheon of gods and goddesses
- **Hanifs**: Contact with monotheistic seekers who rejected polytheism but followed neither Judaism nor Christianity
- **Religious Diversity**: Exposure to Christian and Jewish communities during travels and in neighboring areas
- **Tribal Values**: Immersion in Arab ethical concepts of honor, generosity, and tribal loyalty
- **Social Inequality**: Observation of growing disparity between wealthy merchants and marginalized groups
- **Indigenous Spiritual Practices**: Awareness of Arabian traditions of retreat and meditation

## Commercial Activities

Muhammad developed significant mercantile experience:

- **Trading Journeys**: Accompanied his uncle Abu Talib on commercial caravans to Syria as a youth
- **Encounter with Bahira**: Traditional account of meeting a Christian monk who recognized prophetic signs in the young Muhammad

## Marriage to Khadijah

His marriage to Khadijah marked a turning point in his social standing:

- **Khadijah's Position**: A respected, wealthy widow who managed her own commercial enterprise
- **Business Relationship**: Initial employment of Muhammad to oversee her trading ventures
- **Marriage Proposal**: Khadijah's initiation of marriage when Muhammad was about 25 and she was about 40

- **Children**: Birth of daughters Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum, and Fatimah, and sons al-Qasim and Abdullah (both died in infancy)
- **Household Life**: Establishment of a respected household in Meccan society

## Pre-Prophetic Character and Reputation

Before his prophetic call, Muhammad was known for distinctive qualities:

- **Al-Amin ("The Trustworthy")**: Earned reputation for exceptional honesty and integrity
- **Dispute Resolution**: Respected mediator, exemplified in the story of placing the Black Stone during the Kaaba renovation
- **Contemplative Nature**: Tendency toward reflection and thoughtfulness rather than typical Meccan entertainments

- **Moral Character**: Known for truthfulness, reliability, and ethical conduct in business and personal affairs
- **Avoidance of Idolatry**: Apparent discomfort with many polytheistic practices even before prophetic revelations

## Spiritual Seeking

Muhammad's spiritual inclinations intensified in his later thirties:

## First Revelation and Beginning of Prophethood

At approximately age forty, Muhammad's life changed dramatically:
