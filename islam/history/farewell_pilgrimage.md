![Farewell Pilgrimage](../../images/farewell_pilgrimage.jpg)

The Farewell Pilgrimage (Hajjat al-Wada) was Prophet Muhammad's final and only complete pilgrimage to Mecca as a Muslim in 632 CE, occurring just months before his death. This momentous journey brought together tens of thousands of Muslims and featured Muhammad's famous Farewell Sermon, which outlined fundamental Islamic principles. The event established the rituals of Hajj for future generations and represents a pivotal moment in Islamic historyâ€”the Prophet's final public teaching and the culmination of his prophetic mission.

## Historical Context

By 632 CE (10 AH in the Islamic calendar):

- Islam had become the dominant religion in Arabia
- Mecca had been under Muslim control since its conquest in 630 CE
- The Ka'aba had been cleansed of idols and restored to monotheistic worship
- Muhammad's authority extended throughout most of the Arabian Peninsula
- The Prophet was 63 years old and, though unknown to most, in his final year of life

## The Journey to Mecca

In Dhu al-Qa'dah (the 11th month) of 10 AH (February 632 CE):

- Muhammad announced his intention to perform Hajj
- Muslims from across Arabia gathered to accompany him
- The Prophet departed Medina with a vast assembly of companions
- Historical accounts estimate between 90,000 to 124,000 pilgrims joined the procession
- The journey took approximately ten days

The scale of this pilgrimage was unprecedented and demonstrated Islam's rapid growth over the preceding decade.

## Rituals Performed

Muhammad's performance of the Hajj established the standard for future generations:

- **Ihram**: He entered the state of ritual consecration at Dhul-Hulaifa
- **Talbiyah**: He recited the pilgrim's declaration: "Labbayk Allahumma labbayk" ("Here I am, O God, at Your service")
- **Tawaf**: He circled the Ka'aba seven times upon arrival in Mecca
- **Sa'i**: He walked between the hills of Safa and Marwah seven times
- **Wuquf**: He stood in prayer on the plain of Arafat on the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah
- **Muzdalifah**: He stayed overnight and collected pebbles
- **Jamarat**: He stoned the pillars representing Satan
- **Sacrifice**: He slaughtered sacrificial animals at Mina
- **Concluding Tawaf**: He performed a final circumambulation of the Ka'aba

Throughout these rituals, he instructed his followers: "Take your rituals from me, for I may not perform Hajj after this year."

## The Farewell Sermon

The centerpiece of the pilgrimage was Muhammad's address delivered on the 9th day of Dhu al-Hijjah at Mount Arafat. This sermon synthesized key Islamic teachings and established enduring principles for the Muslim community. Key elements included:

### Ethical and Moral Teachings
- "Just as you regard this month, this day, this city as sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust."
- "Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners."
- "Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you."
- "You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity."

### Social Justice
- "All mankind is from Adam and Eve... There is no superiority of an Arab over a non-Arab, or of a non-Arab over an Arab, and no superiority of a white person over a black person or of a black person over a white person, except on the basis of personal piety and righteousness."
- "The abolition of all customs from the days of jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic ignorance)."

### Economic Principles
- "God has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligations shall henceforth be waived."
- "Your capital, however, is yours to keep."

### Women's Rights
- "Treat women well and be kind to them, for they are your partners and committed helpers."
- "You have rights over your women, and your women have rights over you."

### The Completed Religion
- The revelation of the verse: "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion." (Quran 5:3)

### Perpetuation of Islamic Teachings
- "Those who are present should convey this message to those who are absent."
- "You will be asked about me, so what will you say?"
- The assembly responded: "We bear witness that you have conveyed the message, fulfilled your mission and given your advice."

The sermon culminated with Muhammad raising his finger to the sky and calling upon God to witness that he had delivered His message to humanity.

## Significance and Legacy

The Farewell Pilgrimage holds profound significance in Islamic history and thought:

### Religious Significance

- Served as a transitional moment from prophetic leadership to the caliphate era
- Provided Muhammad's final opportunity to address the entire Muslim community
- Foreshadowed the Prophet's imminent departure from earthly life

### Ethical Framework
- Articulated fundamental human rights regarding life, property, and dignity
- Emphasized equality among people regardless of racial or social background

- Outlined economic principles based on fairness and justice

### Commemorations

## Historical Transmission

The details of the Farewell Pilgrimage come from several sources:

- Multiple companions who witnessed the events narrated their accounts
- Early biographical works (sira) recorded comprehensive descriptions
- Hadith collections contain fragments of the sermon and rituals
- The event is referenced in the Quran itself (the revelation of 5:3)

Despite some variations in wording across different historical accounts, there is remarkable consistency regarding the core teachings and events.

## Aftermath

Shortly after returning to Medina from the Farewell Pilgrimage:

- Muhammad fell ill with a fever that progressively worsened
- He delivered his final sermons in the Mosque of Medina while weakened by illness
- He appointed Abu Bakr to lead prayers when he became too weak to do so
- Approximately three months after the pilgrimage, in June 632 CE, he passed away

The Farewell Pilgrimage thus marks the conclusion of Muhammad's public ministry and serves as his final testament to the Muslim community.
