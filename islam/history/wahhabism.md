# Wahhabi Movement

![Wahhabism](../../images/wahhabism.jpg)

Wahhabism, or the Wahhabi movement, emerged in the 18th century as a reformist, revivalist movement within Sunni Islam in the central Arabian Peninsula. Founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792), the movement called for a return to what it considered the pure, original Islam practiced by the early Muslim community (salaf). Through its alliance with the House of Saud, Wahhabism became the dominant religious and political force in Arabia, eventually forming the ideological foundation of the modern Saudi state. While its adherents prefer to be called Muwahhidun ("Unitarians") or Salafis, and reject the term "Wahhabism" as reductive, this religious movement has exerted profound influence on contemporary Islamic thought and politics worldwide, inspiring various revivalist and fundamentalist movements across the Islamic world.

## Origins and Founder

### Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab
- **Early Life**: Born in Uyayna in the Najd region of central Arabia in 1703 to a family of Hanbali scholars.
- **Education**: Studied in Medina, Basra, and possibly Damascus, exposing him to various Islamic traditions and scholarly debates.
- **Intellectual Influences**: Particularly influenced by the works of Ibn Taymiyyah (1263-1328) and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (1292-1350), medieval scholars who called for strict adherence to Quranic text and authentic hadith.
- **Initial Preaching**: Began preaching his reformist message in his hometown of Uyayna but faced opposition and was expelled.

### Core Doctrine
- **Tawhid (Monotheism)**: Absolute emphasis on God's oneness and opposition to anything perceived as compromising pure monotheism.
- **Opposition to Shirk (Polytheism)**: Expansive definition of "associating partners with God," including many common practices like veneration of saints.
- **Rejection of Bid'ah (Innovation)**: Strong opposition to religious practices not explicitly sanctioned in the Quran and hadith.
- **Focus on Textual Authority**: Literal interpretation of religious texts with limited role for tradition, consensus, or interpretive flexibility.
- **Moral Austerity**: Emphasis on strict moral codes and behavioral conformity.

## Political Alliance and Early Expansion

### The Saudi-Wahhabi Pact
- **Alliance with Muhammad ibn Saud**: In 1744, after being expelled from Uyayna, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab found protection with Muhammad ibn Saud, ruler of the small town of Diriyah.
- **Political-Religious Covenant**: The two leaders formed a pact: Ibn Saud would protect and promote Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's religious teachings, while Ibn Abd al-Wahhab would support Ibn Saud's political authority.
- **Legitimizing Framework**: The alliance provided religious legitimacy to Saudi political expansion and military force to Wahhabi religious reform.

### First Saudi State (1744-1818)
- **Expansion in Arabia**: Using the religious motivation of combating "idolatry," Saudi-Wahhabi forces gradually conquered much of the Arabian Peninsula.
- **Capture of Mecca and Medina**: By 1805, they controlled the holy cities, implementing strict Wahhabi interpretations and destroying shrines and tombs they considered idolatrous.
- **Ottoman Response**: The Ottoman Empire, as guardians of the holy cities, viewed the Wahhabi takeover as a threat and commissioned Muhammad Ali of Egypt to suppress them.
- **Defeat and Collapse**: In 1818, Ibrahim Pasha, son of Muhammad Ali, destroyed Diriyah and ended the first Saudi state, though the religious movement continued.

## Historical Development

### Second Saudi State (1824-1891)
- **Revival**: The Saudi-Wahhabi alliance reemerged in 1824, establishing a new state centered in Riyadh.
- **Limited Expansion**: This state never reached the territorial extent of the first and faced internal divisions and external pressures.
- **Continued Influence**: Despite political limitations, Wahhabi teachings remained influential in central Arabia.

### Ibn Saud and Modern Saudi Arabia
- **Capture of Riyadh (1902)**: Abdul Aziz ibn Saud recaptured Riyadh from rival clan Al Rashid, beginning the third Saudi state.
- **Ikhwan Movement**: Ibn Saud mobilized Bedouin warriors into a religiously motivated fighting force called the Ikhwan (Brothers).
- **Kingdom Formation**: By 1932, Ibn Saud had unified most of the Arabian Peninsula into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with Wahhabism as its official religious orientation.
- **Ikhwan Rebellion**: When Ibn Saud restrained further expansion and began modernizing aspects of the state, the most zealous Ikhwan rebelled and were crushed in 1929, representing an early tension between state interests and religious purism.

### Oil Wealth and Global Expansion
- **Impact of Oil Revenues**: After the discovery of oil in 1938, Saudi Arabia gained unprecedented wealth, much of which was directed toward promoting Wahhabi Islam globally.
- **Educational Institutions**: Establishment of universities and scholarship programs to train religious scholars in Wahhabi doctrine.
- **Publishing and Media**: Massive publication and distribution of Wahhabi religious materials worldwide.
- **Mosque Construction**: Funding mosques and Islamic centers across the world, often with Wahhabi imams.
- **International Organizations**: Support for global Islamic organizations that often promote Wahhabi-influenced interpretations.

## Doctrinal Characteristics

### Religious Practices
- **Prayer Observance**: Strict enforcement of prayer times and attendance at mosques.
- **Gender Segregation**: Strong separation of men and women in public spaces and religious institutions.
- **Iconoclasm**: Prohibition of religious images, shrines, and elaborate grave markers.
- **Moral Policing**: Enforcement of public morality through religious police (Mutaween).

### Theological Positions
- **Anthropomorphism**: Acceptance of literal descriptions of God in the Quran while maintaining God's uniqueness.
- **Intercession**: Rejection of seeking intercession from saints or the Prophet Muhammad.
- **Sufism**: Opposition to most Sufi practices as innovations and potential shirk, though early Wahhabism incorporated some aspects of spiritual purification.
- **Other Muslims**: Often critical of practices common in other Islamic traditions, particularly those of Shiites and Sufi orders.

### Legal Methodology
- **Hanbali School**: Generally follows the Hanbali legal school, the most literalist of the four main Sunni schools.
- **Independent Reasoning**: Emphasizes direct application of Quranic and hadith texts over established legal precedents.
- **Consensus Limitation**: Narrows the concept of scholarly consensus (ijma) to only the earliest generations of Muslims.
- **Hadith Emphasis**: Prioritizes hadith over other sources of law, with less critical historical assessment of hadith authenticity than other traditions.

## Global Influence and Contemporary Significance

### Relationship to Modern Movements
- **Salafism**: Modern Salafi movements share many doctrinal positions with Wahhabism, though some reject association with the term.
- **Jihadist Ideologies**: Some violent extremist groups draw on selective aspects of Wahhabi teachings, though the Saudi establishment and official Wahhabi scholars typically denounce terrorism.
- **Islamic Revivalism**: Contributed to broader Islamic revivalist trends in the 20th century, emphasizing return to textual sources.

### Geopolitical Dimensions
- **Cold War Context**: Saudi promotion of Wahhabism intensified during the Cold War as an anti-communist religious force, supported by Western powers.
- **Afghan Jihad**: Significant Saudi and Wahhabi involvement in supporting Afghan mujahideen against Soviet occupation (1979-1989).
- **Gulf Wars**: The stationing of Western troops in Saudi Arabia during and after the 1990-91 Gulf War created tensions within Wahhabi circles.
- **Saudi-Iran Rivalry**: The Saudi-Iranian competition for influence in the Muslim world has often been expressed through religious dimensions, with Wahhabi anti-Shiism as a component.

### Reforms and Evolution
- **Post-9/11 Changes**: Following criticism after the September 11, 2001 attacks (in which 15 of 19 hijackers were Saudi), some reforms to religious education and extremist rhetoric were implemented.
- **Vision 2030**: Under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's modernization agenda launched in 2016, some restrictions associated with Wahhabi interpretations have been relaxed.
- **Religious Moderation Campaign**: Recent Saudi initiatives promote what officials call "moderate Islam," distancing from more extreme interpretations while maintaining Wahhabi foundations.

## Critiques and Controversies

### Muslim Critiques
- **Traditional Sunni Objections**: Many traditional Sunni scholars criticize Wahhabism for oversimplifying complex theological issues and rejecting centuries of scholarly development.
- **Sufi Opposition**: Sufis reject Wahhabi claims that many of their practices constitute polytheism or innovation.
- **Shiite Conflicts**: Shiites have faced persecution under Wahhabi influence due to their veneration of the Prophet's family and distinct practices deemed heterodox.
- **Historical Revisionism**: Critics accuse Wahhabism of selectively reading Islamic history to support its positions.

### Contemporary Concerns
- **Religious Intolerance**: Critics argue that Wahhabi interpretations promote intolerance toward other religious views, including other Islamic traditions.
- **Extremism Connection**: Debates continue about connections between Wahhabi teachings and violent extremist groups, though most Wahhabi scholars condemn terrorism.
