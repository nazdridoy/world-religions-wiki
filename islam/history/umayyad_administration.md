# Administrative Systems of the Umayyads

![Umayyad Administration](../../images/umayyad_admin.jpg)

The Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE) established the first hereditary dynasty in Islamic history and developed sophisticated administrative structures to govern their vast empire. Building upon Byzantine and Sassanid Persian administrative traditions while adding distinctly Islamic elements, the Umayyads created a governance system that would influence Islamic administration for centuries. Their administrative innovations helped manage diverse populations across three continents and facilitated the transition from a tribal Arab confederacy to an imperial structure.

## Central Government

### The Caliph and Court
- **Caliphal Authority**: The Umayyad caliph combined religious authority as successor to Muhammad with absolute political power.
- **Hereditary Succession**: Unlike the Rashidun period, the caliphate became hereditary within the Umayyad family, typically passing from father to son.
- **Court Ceremony**: Umayyad caliphs adopted elements of Byzantine and Persian court protocol, creating more formal and elaborate ceremonial practices.
- **Royal Patronage**: Caliphs maintained loyalty through generous gifts and appointments to supporters, particularly among Arab tribal elites.

### Administrative Departments (Diwans)
- **Diwan al-Kharaj**: The treasury department responsible for collecting taxes and managing state revenue.
- **Diwan al-Jund**: The military department that maintained registers of soldiers and handled their payment.
- **Diwan al-Rasa'il**: The chancellery that handled official correspondence and state documents.
- **Diwan al-Khatam**: The department of the seal, which authenticated official documents.
- **Diwan al-Barid**: The postal service, which facilitated communication across the empire and served as an intelligence gathering system.

## Provincial Governance

### Administrative Divisions
- **Wilayat (Provinces)**: The empire was divided into provinces, each headed by a governor (wali) appointed by the caliph.
- **Major Provinces**: The principal provinces included Syria (the power base), Egypt, Iraq, Khorasan, North Africa, and later al-Andalus.

### Governors and Local Administration
- **Appointment System**: Governors were typically drawn from the Arab elite, often from families with close ties to the Umayyads.
- **Gubernatorial Powers**: Governors had broad authority over military affairs, tax collection, administration of justice, and religious matters.
- **Local Officials**: Non-Arab converts (mawali) and indigenous officials often staffed lower administrative positions, particularly in finance and clerical work.

### Urban Administration
- **Amsar (Garrison Cities)**: New military settlements like Kufa, Basra, Fustat, and Qayrawan served as administrative centers.
- **Qadis (Judges)**: Appointed to administer Islamic law in major cities and towns.
- **Market Supervisors (Muhtasib)**: Officials who monitored commercial activities and enforced ethical practices in marketplaces.

## Financial System

### Taxation
- **Jizya**: Poll tax paid by non-Muslim subjects (dhimmis) in exchange for protection and exemption from military service.
- **Kharaj**: Land tax collected from agricultural lands, regardless of the owner's religion.
- **Ushr**: Reduced land tax for Muslim landowners, typically one-tenth of produce.
- **Zakat**: Obligatory alms tax paid by Muslims to support the poor and other charitable causes.
- **Ghanimah and Fay**: Portions of war booty and conquered lands allocated to the state treasury.

### Currency Reform
- **Islamic Coinage**: Abd al-Malik (685-705 CE) introduced distinctly Islamic gold dinars and silver dirhams, replacing Byzantine and Sassanid coins.
- **Standardization**: The new currency system facilitated trade across the vast empire and symbolized Umayyad sovereignty.

## Military Organization

### Standing Army
- **Professional Soldiers**: The Umayyads maintained a permanent, professional army rather than relying solely on tribal levies.
- **Jund System**: Military units often settled in specific regions, with soldiers receiving regular stipends from the state.

### Tribal Contingents
- **Arab Military Elite**: Arab tribesmen continued to form the core of the military, organized according to tribal affiliations.
- **Tribal Registers**: Elaborate records tracked tribal affiliations and payment entitlements based on precedence in conversion and military service.

## Legal and Religious Administration

### Early Islamic Law
- **Qadis and Fiqh**: The foundation of Islamic jurisprudence was laid during this period, with judges applying emerging principles of Islamic law.
- **Relationship to Caliphal Authority**: While developing independently, legal scholars operated within and sometimes in tension with caliphal authority.

### Religious Infrastructure
- **Mosque Construction**: The Umayyads built magnificent mosques in major cities as symbols of Islamic rule and centers for community governance.
- **Religious Authorities**: Imams, prayer leaders, and religious scholars were often appointed and supported by the state.

## Controversial Policies

### Arab Privileges
- **Mawali Status**: Non-Arab converts to Islam (mawali) generally held lower social status and paid higher taxes than Arab Muslims.
- **Arab Settlement Patterns**: Arabs typically lived separately from local populations in garrison cities or special quarters.

### Fiscal Reforms
- **Al-Hajjaj's Reforms**: The powerful governor of Iraq implemented controversial tax reforms requiring new converts to continue paying non-Muslim taxes.
- **Language of Administration**: While gradually shifting from Greek, Persian, and Coptic to Arabic, bilingual administration continued throughout the period.

## Successes and Limitations

### Administrative Achievements
- **Imperial Integration**: Successfully incorporated diverse regions under a unified administrative system.
- **Infrastructure Development**: Improved roads, communication systems, irrigation networks, and urban centers.
- **Cultural Synthesis**: Blended Arabian, Byzantine, and Persian administrative traditions into a new Islamic imperial model.

### Factors in Decline
- **Tribal Factionalism**: Persistent rivalry between northern (Qays) and southern (Yaman) Arab tribes undermined administrative stability.
- **Social Inequality**: The privileged position of Arabs over non-Arabs created widespread discontent.
- **Financial Strain**: The enormous costs of maintaining the empire and military campaigns placed pressure on the taxation system.
- **Religious Opposition**: Growing religious criticism of Umayyad policies, particularly from proto-Shiite and pietistic movements.

## Legacy

The administrative structures developed by the Umayyads had lasting impact through:
- Providing the foundations for the more sophisticated Abbasid administrative system
- Establishing precedents for balancing central authority with regional governance
- Developing institutions that would evolve into classical Islamic administrative norms
- Creating models for integration of conquered territories into an Islamic imperial system
- Demonstrating both the possibilities and challenges of governing multi-ethnic, multi-religious societies under Islamic rule
