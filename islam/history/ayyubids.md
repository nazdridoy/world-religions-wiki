# The Ayyubids and Saladin

![Saladin and the Ayyubids](../../images/saladin_ayyubids.jpg)

The Ayyubid dynasty (1171-1260 CE) was a Sunni Muslim dynasty of Kurdish origin founded by Salah ad-Din (Saladin), which ruled over Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen, and parts of North Africa during the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Rising in response to the Crusader states established in the Levant, the Ayyubids are best known for recapturing Jerusalem from the Crusaders and for establishing efficient political and military institutions. Under their rule, trade flourished, and cultural, educational, and religious institutions were revitalized in what became a significant chapter in the medieval Islamic world.

## Saladin's Rise to Power

Saladin's path to leadership emerged through military service and political acumen:

- **Early Career**: Born to a Kurdish family in Tikrit, Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (Saladin) served under his uncle Shirkuh, a military commander for the Zengid ruler Nur ad-Din.
- **Egyptian Campaigns**: Between 1164 and 1169, Saladin accompanied Shirkuh on three expeditions to Egypt, initially aimed at preventing Crusader dominance of the faltering Fatimid Caliphate.
- **Vizier of Egypt**: Following Shirkuh's death in 1169, Saladin was appointed vizier by the last Fatimid caliph, al-Adid.
- **End of the Fatimids**: Upon al-Adid's death in 1171, Saladin abolished the Fatimid Caliphate, returning Egypt to Sunni Islam under nominal Abbasid authority.
- **Consolidation in Egypt**: Saladin spent his early years as ruler strengthening his position in Egypt, reforming administration, and building up military forces.
- **Independence from Nur ad-Din**: While officially Nur ad-Din's subordinate, Saladin carefully managed this relationship until the Zengid ruler's death in 1174.

## Expansion and the Crusader Challenge

After consolidating power in Egypt, Saladin expanded Ayyubid territories and confronted the Crusader states:

- **Syrian Acquisition**: Following Nur ad-Din's death, Saladin gradually extended control over Damascus (1174), Aleppo (1183), and most of Syria, despite resistance from Nur ad-Din's heirs.
- **Unification Strategy**: Saladin's expansion aimed to unite Muslim territories surrounding the Crusader states, creating a unified front against them.
- **Early Crusader Conflicts**: Throughout the 1170s and early 1180s, Saladin engaged in limited conflicts with the Crusader states, interspersed with truces.
- **Battle of Hattin**: In July 1187, Saladin decisively defeated the Crusader armies at the Horns of Hattin, effectively destroying the military capacity of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
- **Reconquest of Jerusalem**: In October 1187, Jerusalem fell to Saladin, ending 88 years of Christian rule and triggering the Third Crusade.
- **The Third Crusade**: From 1189 to 1192, Saladin defended his territories against the forces of Richard the Lionheart, Philip II of France, and Frederick Barbarossa, ultimately maintaining control of Jerusalem while ceding some coastal areas.
- **Treaty of Ramla**: The 1192 peace agreement with Richard I established a truce and allowed Christian pilgrims access to Jerusalem, while the city remained under Muslim control.

## Ayyubid State and Administration

The Ayyubid state developed sophisticated administrative structures:

- **Federal Structure**: Saladin established a family federation where territories were distributed among relatives but remained under his ultimate authority.
- **Iqta System**: Like the Seljuks before them, the Ayyubids used land grants (iqta) to support military commanders and their troops.
- **Centralized Bureaucracy**: A professional bureaucracy managed taxation, diplomatic correspondence, and other administrative functions.
- **Economic Policies**: The Ayyubids promoted agriculture, manufacturing, and especially trade, developing strong commercial ties with Italian maritime republics.
- **Diplomatic Networks**: The dynasty maintained extensive diplomatic relations with various powers, including the Byzantine Empire, the Seljuks of Rum, and European states.
- **Military Organization**: Ayyubid armies combined Kurdish and Turkish cavalry with mamluks (military slaves) who formed elite units.
- **Naval Development**: Under Ayyubid rule, Egypt developed a significant naval presence in the eastern Mediterranean and Red Sea.

## Cultural and Religious Policies

Saladin and his successors were significant patrons of religion, education, and culture:

- **Sunni Revival**: After abolishing the Fatimid Caliphate, Saladin promoted Sunni orthodoxy, establishing numerous madrasas to teach Shafi'i and other Sunni legal schools.
- **Religious Tolerance**: Despite their commitment to Sunni Islam, the Ayyubids generally practiced religious tolerance toward Christians, Jews, and Shi'ites.
- **Educational Institutions**: The Ayyubids founded numerous schools, libraries, and hospitals throughout their territories.
- **Architectural Patronage**: The dynasty sponsored significant building projects, including the Cairo Citadel, numerous fortifications, madrasas, mosques, and caravanserais.
- **Literary and Scientific Support**: Ayyubid courts attracted scholars, poets, historians, and scientists, producing important works in various fields.
- **Sufi Patronage**: The Ayyubids supported various Sufi orders, contributing to the expansion of Sufism in the region.
- **Legal Reforms**: Saladin and his successors implemented judicial reforms, appointing chief judges for different legal schools and establishing a more structured legal system.

## The Later Ayyubid Period

After Saladin's death in 1193, the dynasty continued under his successors:

- **Succession Crisis**: Saladin's territories were divided among his sons and brother, al-Adil, leading to internal conflicts.
- **Al-Adil's Consolidation**: By 1200, Saladin's brother al-Adil had reunified most Ayyubid territories under his control.
- **Al-Kamil's Rule**: Saladin's nephew al-Kamil (r. 1218-1238) faced the Fifth and Sixth Crusades, famously negotiating with Emperor Frederick II to peacefully grant Christians access to Jerusalem while maintaining Muslim sovereignty.
- **Regional Challenges**: Later Ayyubid rulers contended with the Khwarazmians, the Seljuks of Rum, and continuing Crusader threats.
- **Economic Prosperity**: Despite political challenges, the Ayyubid period was generally one of economic growth, particularly in Egypt.
- **Territorial Fragmentation**: By the mid-13th century, the Ayyubid domains had fragmented into several smaller principalities ruled by different branches of the family.

## Fall of the Dynasty

Several factors contributed to the eventual end of Ayyubid rule:

- **Mamluk Power**: The increasing reliance on mamluks (military slaves) created a powerful military elite that eventually overthrew their Ayyubid masters.
- **Seventh Crusade**: The invasion led by Louis IX of France in 1249-1250 weakened Ayyubid authority in Egypt.
- **Mongol Threat**: The expanding Mongol Empire conquered Ayyubid territories in Mesopotamia and threatened Syria.
- **Mamluk Coup in Egypt**: In 1250, Mamluk officers assassinated Turanshah, the last Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, establishing the Mamluk Sultanate.
- **Mongol Invasion of Syria**: In 1260, Mongol forces conquered Aleppo and Damascus, temporarily ending Ayyubid rule in Syria.
- **Battle of Ain Jalut**: The Mamluks defeated the Mongols at Ain Jalut in 1260, establishing their authority over former Ayyubid territories in Syria.
- **Surviving Principalities**: Small Ayyubid principalities continued in Homs and Hama until later absorption into the Mamluk Sultanate.

## Legacy

The Ayyubid dynasty left a lasting impact on the Middle East:

- **Religious Infrastructure**: The madrasas, mosques, and other religious institutions established by the Ayyubids shaped Islamic education for centuries.
- **Architectural Heritage**: Ayyubid fortifications, religious buildings, and urban development projects remained influential long after the dynasty's fall.
- **Political Model**: The federal system of family rule influenced subsequent dynasties in the region.
- **Muslim Unity**: Saladin's example of unifying Muslim territories against external threats became a powerful historical model.
- **Mamluk Foundations**: Ayyubid military and administrative systems laid the groundwork for the subsequent Mamluk Sultanate.
- **Historical Reputation**: Saladin in particular achieved legendary status in both Islamic and Western traditions as an exemplar of chivalry, justice, and military skill.
- **Cultural Revival**: The Ayyubid period saw a significant revival of Arabic literature, historical writing, and religious scholarship that continued to influence Islamic culture.
