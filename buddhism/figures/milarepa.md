## Primary Sources

Our knowledge of Milarepa comes primarily from:

## Life Story

### Early Life and Tragedy

Milarepa was born in 1052 CE to a prosperous family in the Gungthang region of southern Tibet:

- Named Mila Thöpaga ("Delightful to Hear") at birth
- Lived happily until age seven when his father, Mila Sherab Gyaltsen, died
- His father entrusted the family wealth to his uncle and aunt for safekeeping until Milarepa came of age
- The uncle and aunt betrayed this trust, seized the property, and forced Milarepa, his mother Nyangtsa Kargyen, and his sister Peta into servitude
- They were treated cruelly and made to work as servants in what had been their own home
- This betrayal and mistreatment planted seeds of revenge in Milarepa and his mother

### Black Magic and Revenge

At his mother's urging, the young Milarepa sought vengeance:

- Traveled to learn black magic from various sorcerers
- Studied with a powerful magician who taught him destructive rituals
- Returned and constructed a small room on the roof of his uncle's house
- Performed rituals that caused the house to collapse during a wedding feast
- The magical attack killed 35 people, including the uncle's entire family
- Later sent hailstorms to destroy the crops of villagers who had supported his relatives
- These acts of revenge brought him temporary satisfaction but soon led to profound regret

### Turning to the Dharma

Overwhelmed by remorse and fear of karmic consequences:

- Realized the enormity of his negative actions and the certainty of rebirth in hell realms
- Sought Buddhist teachings to purify his karma and attain liberation
- Initially studied with Rongtön Lhaga, a Nyingma teacher
- Rongtön directed him to Marpa the Translator, saying only Marpa's teachings could help someone with such heavy karma

### Meeting Marpa

Milarepa's encounter with Marpa the Translator (1012-1097) was pivotal:

- Subjected Milarepa to extraordinary hardships and tests rather than immediately giving teachings
- Ordered him to build a stone tower, then commanded him to tear it down and start again
- This process was repeated four times with different towers
- Each tower represented one of the four activities of enlightened beings
- Throughout this period, Marpa treated Milarepa harshly, often beating and verbally abusing him
- Marpa's wife, Dagmema, showed compassion to Milarepa during these trials
- After nearly giving up several times, Milarepa persevered through these ordeals

### Receiving Teachings

After years of testing and purification:

- Formally accepted Milarepa as a disciple and gave him the name Mila Dorje Gyaltsen

- Transmitted the Six Yogas of Naropa, Mahamudra, and other profound teachings
- Instructed Milarepa to meditate in solitude in mountain caves
- Prophesied that Milarepa would attain enlightenment and benefit many beings
- After receiving complete transmission, Milarepa returned to his homeland
