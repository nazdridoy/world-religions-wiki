# Manjushri: The Bodhisattva of Wisdom

Manjushri (Sanskrit: Mañjuśrī; Tibetan: Jampelyang; Chinese: Wenshu; Japanese: Monju) is one of the most important bodhisattvas in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, embodying transcendent wisdom, intellectual acuity, and eloquence. His name means "Gentle Glory" or "Sweet Splendor," and he is revered as the manifestation of the wisdom of all Buddhas, the one who cuts through ignorance with the sharp sword of prajna (wisdom).

## Identity and Significance

Manjushri represents the perfection of wisdom (prajna paramita), which in Buddhism is the ultimate understanding of the true nature of reality—emptiness (sunyata). He embodies several crucial aspects:

- **Transcendent wisdom**: The insight that directly perceives emptiness
- **Discriminating awareness**: The capacity to distinguish truth from falsehood
- **Intellectual clarity**: The ability to comprehend complex teachings
- **Eloquence and communication**: The skill to express profound concepts clearly
- **Spiritual memory**: The retention of teachings across lifetimes

Unlike some bodhisattvas who primarily emphasize compassionate action, Manjushri's domain is awakened intelligence—the penetrating insight that sees through delusion and ignorance to recognize the ultimate nature of phenomena.

## Iconographic Representations
