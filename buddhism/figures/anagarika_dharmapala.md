# Anagarika Dharmapala (1864-1933)

Anagarika Dharmapala was a pivotal figure in the revival of Buddhism in India and Sri Lanka during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As one of the first modern Buddhist missionaries to the West, he helped bring Buddhism to international attention and played a crucial role in the Buddhist revival movement that countered colonial Christian influence in South Asia.

## Biography

### Early Life and Education

Don David Hewavitarne (later known as Anagarika Dharmapala) was born on September 17, 1864, in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), to a wealthy Buddhist family. His parents, Don Carolis Hewavitarne and Mallika Dharmagunawardhana, were devout Buddhists but had him educated in Christian missionary schools, which was common for privileged children during British colonial rule.

His education at these Christian institutions exposed him to Western culture and English language but also made him acutely aware of the colonial attitudes toward Buddhism and Sri Lankan culture. This early experience would shape his later mission to defend and revitalize Buddhism.

### Spiritual Awakening

In his youth, Hewavitarne was deeply influenced by two significant events:

1. Meeting Colonel Henry Steel Olcott and Madame Helena Blavatsky, founders of the Theosophical Society, in 1880
2. Witnessing Buddhist-Catholic riots in 1883, where he saw the vulnerability of Buddhism under colonial rule

These experiences sparked his dedication to Buddhist revival. In 1883, at age 19, he joined the Theosophical Society and began working closely with Olcott on Buddhist educational initiatives.

### Becoming the "Anagarika"

In 1885, he adopted the name "Dharmapala" (meaning "guardian of the dharma") and created for himself a unique role as an "anagarika" â€“ a status between monk and layperson. As an anagarika, he:

- Observed celibacy and other ascetic practices
- Wore a simple white robe
- Dedicated himself fully to religious work
- Maintained the flexibility to engage in social and political activities that traditional monks could not

This innovative status allowed him to bridge monastic and lay Buddhist communities while actively participating in social reform.

## Major Contributions and Activities

### Maha Bodhi Society

In 1891, Dharmapala founded the Maha Bodhi Society, an organization dedicated to:
- Restoring Buddhist control of the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, India (the site of the Buddha's enlightenment)
- Reviving Buddhism in India, the land of its birth
- Publishing Buddhist literature and spreading Buddhist education
- Uniting Buddhists of different countries and traditions

The society established branches in many countries and continues to be active today.

### International Buddhist Activism

Dharmapala gained international recognition when he represented Buddhism at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893. His speech made a significant impression, introducing many Americans to Theravada Buddhism for the first time. During this period, he:

- Traveled extensively throughout America, Europe, and Asia
- Established connections with Western intellectuals and sympathizers
- Founded Buddhist missions in several countries
- Challenged Orientalist misconceptions about Buddhism

### Publications and Writing

Dharmapala was a prolific writer who used print media effectively to spread Buddhist ideas:

- Founded and edited the Maha Bodhi Journal
- Wrote numerous articles and pamphlets in both English and Sinhala

- Establish Buddhist schools free from colonial influence
- Revive traditional Sri Lankan arts, crafts, and architecture

## Philosophical and Religious Teachings

### Buddhist Modernism

Dharmapala was a key architect of "Buddhist Modernism," an approach that:

- Downplayed supernatural elements
- Presented Buddhism as compatible with modern science and Western philosophy
- Focused on the ethical and psychological dimensions of Buddhist practice
- Promoted meditation as a practical technique rather than a purely religious practice

### Protestant Buddhism

Scholars have identified Dharmapala's approach as "Protestant Buddhism" because it:
- Emphasized the role of the laity in religious practice
- Reduced the ritualistic aspects of traditional Buddhism
- Promoted direct study of texts rather than reliance on monastic interpretation
- Advocated social engagement and reform
- Applied Buddhism to address contemporary social problems

### Nationalist Buddhism

Dharmapala connected Buddhism with emerging Sri Lankan national identity:
- Viewed Buddhism as the authentic cultural heritage of Sri Lanka
- Linked Buddhist revival with anti-colonial resistance
- Promoted pride in Sri Lanka's Buddhist history and civilization

- His Buddhist nationalism sometimes contained anti-Tamil and anti-Muslim rhetoric
