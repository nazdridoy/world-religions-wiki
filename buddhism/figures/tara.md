# Tara: Female Bodhisattva of Compassion and Action

Tara (Sanskrit: तारा, Tibetan: སྒྲོལ་མ, Drolma) is one of the most beloved and revered female bodhisattvas in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. Known as the "Mother of Liberation," Tara embodies compassionate action, representing the swift and fearless activity of enlightened wisdom. She is particularly prominent in Tibetan Buddhism, where she is considered the female aspect of Avalokiteshvara and a fully enlightened buddha in her own right.

## Origins and Development

The origins of Tara as a Buddhist deity can be traced to multiple sources:

### Indian Origins

In India, Tara emerged as a significant figure around the 5th-6th centuries CE:

- Early references appear in tantric texts such as the Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa
- She developed from being an attendant of Avalokiteshvara to becoming a major independent deity
- Her cult flourished at important Buddhist centers like Nalanda and Vikramashila
- Stone images of Tara from the Pala period (8th-12th centuries CE) show her established iconography

### Origin Myths

Several traditional accounts explain Tara's origins:

1. **Tears of Compassion**: According to a popular legend, Tara was born from the tears of Avalokiteshvara. When he witnessed the continued suffering of beings despite his efforts, he wept, and from his tears on the ground sprang Tara, who promised to help him in his compassionate work.

2. **Princess Yeshe Dawa**: Another account tells of a princess named Yeshe Dawa ("Moon of Primordial Wisdom") who lived millions of years ago. After making offerings to the Buddha of her time for millions of years, monks advised her to pray for rebirth as a man to advance on the spiritual path. She refused, vowing instead to attain enlightenment in female form to demonstrate that spiritual advancement has no gender. She kept her vow and became the bodhisattva Tara.

3. **Prajñaparamita Manifestation**: In some traditions, Tara is seen as a manifestation of the perfection of wisdom (Prajñaparamita) in active, compassionate form.

## The Twenty-One Taras

One of the most significant aspects of Tara worship is the tradition of the "Twenty-One Taras," each representing different aspects of her enlightened activity. This tradition stems from the "Homage to the Twenty-One Taras" (Namastāre viṃśatikaṃ), an ancient text with Indian origins that became extremely popular in Tibet.

The Twenty-One Taras share certain attributes but vary in color, posture, and the specific challenges they help overcome. Common forms include:

## Significance Across Traditions

While Tara is most prominent in Tibetan Buddhism, her influence extends to other Buddhist cultures:

### Tibetan Buddhism

In Tibet, Tara is considered one of the most important deities:
- All major schools (Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, Gelug) include Tara practices
- She is often considered the special protector of Tibet
- Many prominent female tulkus (reincarnate teachers) are considered her emanations
- The Dalai Lamas have strong devotional connections to Green Tara

### Nepalese Buddhism

- Particularly strong devotion among Newar Buddhists
- Important Tara temples in Kathmandu Valley
- Integration with local Hindu goddess traditions

### Chinese and East Asian Buddhism

- Known as Duōluó Púsà (多羅菩薩) in Chinese
- Less prominent than in Tibetan traditions but still recognized
- Often associated with Guanyin (Avalokiteshvara)

### Contemporary Western Buddhism

- Gaining increasing popularity as a female enlightened figure
- Appealing to those seeking feminine expressions of enlightenment
- Important in feminist interpretations of Buddhism

## Philosophical and Psychological Significance

Beyond her role in formal practice, Tara embodies important philosophical concepts:

### Feminine Enlightenment

Tara represents the principle that enlightenment transcends gender, challenging historical male-dominated interpretations of Buddhism. Her vow to achieve awakening in female form provides an important counterbalance in Buddhist tradition.

### Compassion in Action

Unlike figures who represent contemplative aspects of enlightenment, Tara embodies the active principle of compassion—she is often shown in a posture ready to step forward to help beings, representing enlightened activity rather than just enlightened wisdom.

### Emptiness and Form

As a fully enlightened buddha appearing in female form, Tara exemplifies the unity of emptiness (ultimate reality) and form (conventional appearance)—a key concept in Mahayana philosophy.

### Psychological Transformation

In psychological interpretations, Tara represents the transformation of fear into fearlessness, and attachment into compassion—qualities developed through Buddhist practice.
