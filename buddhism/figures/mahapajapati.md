# Mahapajapati Gotami: First Buddhist Nun

Mahapajapati Gotami holds a unique and pivotal place in Buddhist history as the Buddha's maternal aunt and foster mother who later became the first ordained Buddhist nun (bhikkhuni). Her determination and persistence led to the establishment of the female monastic order, creating a path for women's full participation in Buddhist religious life. Her story represents a crucial turning point in the history of women's spiritual equality in ancient India.

## Early Life and Relationship to the Buddha

### Royal Background

- Born as a princess of the Koliyan clan
- Sister of Maya, who became the mother of Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha)
- Married King Suddhodana of the Shakya clan, becoming co-wife with her sister
- Lived in Kapilavastu in what is now Nepal

### Becoming the Buddha's Foster Mother

- When her sister Maya died seven days after giving birth to Siddhartha, Mahapajapati took on the responsibility of raising him
- Nursed and cared for the young prince alongside her own son Nanda
- Served as his primary maternal figure throughout his childhood and youth
- Supported him despite her husband's desire for Siddhartha to become a king rather than a spiritual leader

### Life During the Buddha's Absence

- Remained at the palace when Siddhartha left to pursue spiritual enlightenment
- Continued her royal duties during the years of his absence
- Maintained the household after King Suddhodana's death
- Witnessed the Buddha's triumphant return to Kapilavastu as an enlightened teacher

## Quest for Women's Ordination

### Initial Request and Refusal

Five years after the Buddha's enlightenment, following her husband's death:
- Mahapajapati cut her hair, donned yellow robes, and traveled to where the Buddha was teaching
- She requested admission to the Sangha (monastic community) for herself and a group of Shakyan women who accompanied her
- The Buddha initially refused her request three times without explanation
- Undeterred, Mahapajapati and her companions shaved their heads and continued to follow the Buddha

### The Long Journey and Determination

- Mahapajapati and 500 Shakyan women walked approximately 150 miles from Kapilavastu to Vesali
- They stood weeping outside the Buddha's dwelling, feet swollen and covered with dust
- This physical ordeal demonstrated their serious commitment and determination
- Ananda, the Buddha's attendant, found them in this condition and interceded on their behalf

### Ananda's Intervention

Ananda approached the Buddha with three pivotal questions:
1. "Are women capable of attaining the fruits of the spiritual path—stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship?"
2. "Was not Mahapajapati Gotami of great help to you as your aunt and foster mother who nursed you and gave you milk?"
3. "Would it not be good if women could obtain the going forth from home to homelessness in the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata?"

To each question, the Buddha answered affirmatively.

### The Establishment of the Bhikkhuni Sangha

- The Buddha agreed to women's ordination, but established eight special rules (garudhammas) for nuns
- Mahapajapati accepted these conditions immediately
- She became the first ordained Buddhist nun, marking the beginning of the Bhikkhuni Sangha
- The 500 Shakyan women who accompanied her were also ordained

## The Eight Garudhammas (Heavy Rules)

The special rules established for nuns included:
1. A nun, even if ordained for 100 years, must respect, rise for, and bow to a monk ordained even that day
2. Nuns must not spend the rainy season retreat where there are no monks
3. Nuns must request instruction from monks every half-month
4. Nuns must conduct ceremonies in both sanghas (monk and nun)
5. Serious offenses require discipline from both sanghas
6. Probationary training for nuns before higher ordination
7. Nuns must not revile or abuse monks
8. Nuns may not officially admonish monks, but monks may admonish nuns

These rules have been interpreted variously across Buddhist history—some view them as pragmatic accommodations to the patriarchal society of the time, while others question their authenticity or see them as later additions.

## Spiritual Development and Achievements

### Attainment of Enlightenment

- Mahapajapati attained arahantship (complete enlightenment) after receiving the Buddha's teachings
- She mastered both insight meditation and deep concentration states

- Guided and led the community of nuns
- Served as preceptor for other women seeking ordination

- Advocated for the nuns' community

- Recounts her relationship with the Buddha
- Describes her spiritual attainments
- Gives a farewell teaching before her parinirvana
- Demonstrates her profound understanding of the Buddha's teachings
