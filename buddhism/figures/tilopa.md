# Tilopa: Mahasiddha and Source of the Kagyu Lineage

Tilopa (988-1069 CE), also known as Tillipa or Telopa, was a renowned Indian mahasiddha (great adept) who stands at the fountainhead of the Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. Born in Bengal, India, Tilopa transcended conventional religious boundaries, living as a tantric yogi who received direct transmissions from primordial Buddha Vajradhara. His unconventional lifestyle, profound realizations, and transmission of essential meditation practices to his disciple Naropa established him as one of the most important figures in the development of tantric Buddhism and the Kagyu tradition.

## Historical Context

Tilopa lived during a significant period in Indian Buddhist history:

- The late Pala Empire period when tantric Buddhism was flourishing in eastern India
- An era when the great monastic universities like Nalanda were at their peak
- The time when tantric or Vajrayana Buddhism had reached full development
- A period when accomplished yogis often practiced outside institutional structures
- The final golden age of Indian Buddhism before its eventual decline
- An environment where Hindu tantra and Buddhist tantra were cross-fertilizing
- The period when the 84 mahasiddhas were active throughout India

## Historical Sources

Information about Tilopa comes primarily from:

- Tibetan biographical accounts, particularly those in the Kagyu tradition
- Collections of his songs and instructions (dohas)
- Naropa's biography, which includes accounts of his relationship with Tilopa
- The "Blue Annals" (Deb ther sngon po) by Gö Lotsawa Zhönnu Pal
- Oral traditions preserved within the Kagyu lineage
- References in the works of later masters in the tradition
- Iconographic representations in Tibetan and Himalayan art

## Early Life

Traditional accounts of Tilopa's origins vary:

- Some say he was born a Brahmin in Chittagong (in present-day Bangladesh)
- Others claim he was born to a royal family in Bengal
- Alternative accounts describe him as a simple sesame seed grinder or pounder
- The name "Tilopa" itself derives from "til," the Sanskrit word for sesame
- Initially ordained as a Buddhist monk at a monastery in Bengal
- Studied Buddhist philosophy and tantric practices extensively
- Eventually abandoned monastic life to pursue direct experience

## Spiritual Journey

Tilopa's path to realization was unconventional:

### Leaving Conventional Practice

- Renounced monastic vows to pursue direct experience beyond institutional constraints
- Worked as a sesame seed grinder by day, extracting oil from seeds
- This mundane work became a metaphor for extracting essence from appearances
- By night, consorted with a yogini (female tantric practitioner) named Bharima
- Adopted the lifestyle of a mahasiddha, free from conventional limitations
- Practiced in cremation grounds and other places considered impure
- Transcended social norms and religious conventions

### Teachers and Transmissions

According to various traditions, Tilopa received teachings from several human masters:

- **Nagarjuna** (not the Madhyamaka philosopher, but a tantric adept): Transmitted Guhyasamaja Tantra
- **Lawapa/Luipa**: Transmitted Chakrasamvara Tantra
- **Sukhasiddhi**: A female adept who taught advanced completion stage practices
- **Indrabhuti**: Transmitted Mahamaya Tantra
- **Matangi**: A female outcaste who taught transformation of desire

However, Tilopa himself claimed that his ultimate teacher was Vajradhara (Dorje Chang), the primordial Buddha:

- Received direct transmission from Vajradhara through visionary experiences
- Attained complete realization through these direct transmissions
- This direct lineage is called the "short lineage" in the Kagyu tradition
- Emphasized direct experience over textual learning

## Life as a Mahasiddha

After attaining realization, Tilopa lived as an accomplished mahasiddha:

- Wandered throughout northern India, particularly Bengal and Bihar
- Often appeared as a simple, even crude person while possessing profound realization
- Worked in various humble occupations, including grinding sesame seeds and procuring fish
- Frequented places considered impure or forbidden by conventional society
- Demonstrated miraculous powers (siddhis) when necessary to teach disciples
- Composed dohas (spiritual songs) expressing his realization
- Gathered disciples from various backgrounds
- Lived beyond conventional notions of pure and impure, good and bad

### Unconventional Behavior

Tilopa's conduct exemplified the mahasiddha tradition:

- Used shocking behavior to break through disciples' conceptual limitations
- Transcended conventional dualistic thinking
- Demonstrated the inseparability of samsara and nirvana
- Lived as a tantric adept while appearing as an ordinary person
- Employed antinomian methods when appropriate for specific disciples
- Showed that enlightenment exists in the midst of ordinary experience
- Rejected intellectual elaboration in favor of direct experience

## Meeting and Teaching Naropa

Tilopa's most famous disciple was the scholar-turned-yogi Naropa:

### Naropa's Search

- Naropa, a renowned scholar and abbot at Nalanda University, had a vision directing him to find Tilopa
- Abandoned his prestigious position to search for Tilopa
- Underwent twelve major and twelve minor hardships in his quest
- Finally found Tilopa by a riverbank, appearing as a slovenly fisherman

### Testing and Training

Tilopa subjected Naropa to extreme tests and hardships:

- Made Naropa jump from a temple roof, resulting in severe injuries
- Ordered him to steal food and endure beatings
- Commanded him to build and then demolish structures repeatedly
- Required him to offer his own body in various painful ways
- After each ordeal, healed Naropa's injuries through yogic powers
- These trials purified Naropa's karma and tested his devotion
- Each hardship corresponded to a specific obscuration being purified

### Transmission

After Naropa had proven his dedication, Tilopa transmitted the complete teachings:

- Gave empowerments and instructions on various tantric practices
- Transmitted what would later be systematized as the Six Yogas of Naropa
- Provided direct pointing-out instructions on the nature of mind (Mahamudra)
- Bestowed the four special transmissions (bka' babs bzhi)
- Naropa attained realization under Tilopa's guidance
- Appointed Naropa as his dharma heir
- Through Naropa, these teachings eventually reached Tibet via Marpa the Translator

## Core Teachings

Tilopa's essential instructions encompass several key areas:

### Mahamudra

The direct approach to recognizing the nature of mind:

- Direct pointing-out of the mind's true nature beyond conceptual elaboration

- The inseparability of samsara and nirvana
- The natural state as already perfect and complete
- Freedom from fixation on meditation as something to "do"
- Recognition that ordinary mind itself is Buddha

### The Six Yogas

A system of advanced tantric practices later codified by Naropa:

- **Tummo** (Inner Heat): Generation of mystic heat through visualization and breathing
- **Gyulu** (Illusory Body): Recognition of the dream-like nature of physical existence
- **Ösel** (Clear Light): Recognition and resting in the luminous nature of mind
- **Milam** (Dream Yoga): Maintaining awareness during dream states
- **Bardo** (Intermediate State): Practices for the time between death and rebirth
- **Phowa** (Consciousness Transfer): Methods for ejecting consciousness at death

### Tantric Deity Practices

Sophisticated visualization techniques from various tantric systems:

- **Chakrasamvara**: Union of bliss and emptiness
- **Hevajra**: Non-dual wisdom manifestation
- **Guhyasamaja**: Complex completion stage practices
- **Mahamaya**: Illusory body practices
- Integration of deity visualization with understanding of emptiness

### Tilopa's Ganges Mahamudra Instructions

One of Tilopa's most famous teachings is the "Ganges Mahamudra" instruction given to Naropa by the Ganges River. Key points include:

- Transcendence of conceptual mind
- Non-meditation as the highest meditation
- Allowing the mind to rest naturally without fabrication
- Freedom from all extremes and elaborations
- Recognition that all appearances arise from mind itself
- The inseparability of awareness and emptiness

## Famous Verses

Among Tilopa's most well-known teachings are:

> "The problem is not enjoyment; the problem is attachment."

> "Don't recall the past. Don't anticipate the future. Don't dwell in the present. Relax into the natural state."

> "Mahamudra is beyond all words and symbols, but for you, Naropa, earnest and loyal, must this be said: The Void needs no reliance; Mahamudra rests on nought."

> "Let go of what has passed. Let go of what may come. Let go of what is happening now. Don't try to figure anything out. Don't try to make anything happen. Relax, right now, and rest."

The "Six Words of Advice" attributed to Tilopa are particularly concise:

1. Don't recall (past)
2. Don't imagine (future)
3. Don't think (present)
4. Don't examine (analyze)
5. Don't control (meditate)
6. Rest (in natural state)
