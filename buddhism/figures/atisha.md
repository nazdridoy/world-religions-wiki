# Atisha (982-1054)

Atisha Dipankara Shrijnana stands as one of the most significant figures in the history of Tibetan Buddhism. An accomplished Indian master who brought renewed spiritual vigor to Tibet during a critical period, his emphasis on the graduated path to enlightenment, ethical conduct, and the union of sutra and tantra teachings established foundations that continue to shape Tibetan Buddhism today.

## Life and Background

### Early Life in India

Atisha was born in 982 CE in what is now Bangladesh, in the kingdom of Bengal. According to traditional accounts, he was born into the royal family of Zahor as Prince Chandragarbha, surrounded by luxury and privilege. From an early age, he reportedly showed exceptional spiritual inclination, studying various philosophical systems and receiving visions of Tara, who would remain his principal deity throughout his life.

Despite his royal upbringing and the expectations placed upon him to assume political leadership, young Chandragarbha was drawn to religious life. At the age of 11, he began studying with Buddhist masters, and by 19, he renounced his royal inheritance to become a monk at the renowned monastic university of Nalanda.

### Spiritual Training

Atisha's education was remarkably comprehensive, reflecting the rich diversity of late Indian Buddhism:

- He studied extensively at both Nalanda and Vikramashila, the greatest Buddhist universities of his era
- He mastered the philosophical systems of both Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism
- He received training in logic, epistemology, and the treatises of Asanga and Nagarjuna
- He practiced under numerous teachers, reportedly studying with over 150 masters
- He traveled to Sumatra (present-day Indonesia) to study with the renowned master Dharmakirti of Suvarnadvipa (Serlingpa), from whom he received the complete Bodhicitta teachings

After returning from Sumatra, where he studied for 12 years, Atisha became one of India's most respected Buddhist masters. He was appointed as head scholar-monk at Vikramashila monastery, where he became renowned for his scholarship, strict adherence to monastic discipline, and tantric accomplishments.

### Journey to Tibet

In the early 11th century, Buddhism in Tibet was in a precarious state. Following the collapse of the Tibetan Empire and the persecution under King Langdarma (circa 836-842), organized monastic Buddhism had been severely weakened. Although practitioners had preserved various tantric lineages, there was significant confusion about how the various aspects of Buddhism fit together, particularly the relationship between monastic discipline and tantra.

Recognizing this crisis, the western Tibetan king Yeshe 'Od and his nephew Jangchub 'Od sought to revitalize Buddhism by inviting a great Indian master to Tibet. After their initial attempts were unsuccessful, they eventually convinced Atisha to make the difficult journey, despite his advanced age of nearly 60.

In 1042, Atisha arrived in western Tibet (Ngari), where he was warmly received. Although originally invited for two years, he would remain in Tibet for the rest of his life, teaching, translating texts, and establishing a clear framework for Buddhist practice.

### Later Years and Legacy

During his twelve years in Tibet, Atisha traveled extensively, teaching and writing. His most influential work, the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" (Bodhipathapradipa), was composed at the request of Jangchub 'Od and became the model for the entire genre of "lamrim" (stages of the path) literature in Tibetan Buddhism.

Atisha passed away in 1054 at Nyethang, near Lhasa. His direct disciples, particularly Dromtönpa (1005-1064), carried on his lineage, which became known as the Kadampa tradition, characterized by its emphasis on renunciation, compassion, and the systematic integration of all the Buddha's teachings into a coherent path.

## Key Teachings

### The Graduated Path (Lamrim)

Atisha's most influential innovation was his systematic organization of Buddhist teachings into a graduated path suitable for practitioners of different capacities:

- **Initial scope**: Focusing on ethical conduct, impermanence, karma, and rebirth—suitable for those seeking improved rebirth
- **Middle scope**: Focusing on the Four Noble Truths and personal liberation from samsara
- **Great scope**: Focusing on universal compassion, bodhicitta, and the six perfections—the full Mahayana path

This framework integrated various Buddhist teachings that had sometimes appeared contradictory into a coherent developmental progression. The approach acknowledged that different teachings were appropriate for different stages of spiritual development rather than being in conflict.

### Integration of Sutra and Tantra

A significant problem in Tibet was confusion about how tantric practices related to the foundational elements of Buddhism. Atisha clarified that:

- Tantric practice must be built upon the foundation of ethical conduct and bodhicitta
- The vows of individual liberation (Pratimoksha), bodhisattva commitment, and tantric pledges should be held simultaneously
- Tantra is not a replacement for conventional Mahayana practice but its culmination
- Secret tantric teachings should not be practiced without proper preparation and initiation

This integration helped resolve tensions between monastic Buddhism and tantric practitioners, establishing a model where both traditions could coexist and complement each other.

### Lojong (Mind Training)

Atisha introduced the important "mind training" teachings to Tibet, which he had received from his Indonesian teacher Dharmakirti of Suvarnadvipa:

- Techniques for transforming adverse circumstances into the path to enlightenment
- Methods for cultivating bodhicitta through "exchanging self for others"
- Practices for integrating meditation with daily life experiences
- Approaches to purifying negative emotions into wisdom

These practical methods for transforming the mind became a cornerstone of Tibetan spiritual practice across all schools and remain widely practiced today.

### The Importance of a Qualified Teacher

Atisha emphasized the critical role of studying with a qualified spiritual guide:

- He taught that authentic spiritual development depends on properly relying on a teacher
- He modeled this himself through his devotion to his own masters, particularly Dharmakirti
- He stressed that checking the qualifications of a teacher before becoming their student is essential
- He outlined the qualities to look for in a genuine spiritual guide

This emphasis on the teacher-student relationship became a defining characteristic of Tibetan Buddhism.

### Ethical Foundations

Despite his mastery of advanced philosophical and tantric systems, Atisha consistently emphasized the foundational importance of ethical conduct:

- Strict adherence to monastic vows for monks and nuns
- Clear ethical guidelines for lay practitioners
- The inseparability of compassionate motivation from ritual or meditation practice
- The view that tantra without ethical foundation leads to spiritual decline

This ethical emphasis was particularly important in the Tibetan context, where there had been instances of misinterpretation of tantra as transcending conventional morality.

## Major Works

### The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment (Bodhipathapradipa)

Atisha's most influential text is the concise yet comprehensive "Lamp for the Path," which:

- Outlines the entire Buddhist path in 68 verses
- Categorizes practitioners into three types based on their motivation and capacity
- Systematically integrates ethical discipline, bodhicitta cultivation, and wisdom practices
- Provides a framework for incorporating tantra into the broader path

This text became the basis for the later lamrim literature, most notably Tsongkhapa's comprehensive "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" (Lamrim Chenmo).

### Heart of the Middle Way (Madhyamakopadesa)

This text presents Atisha's understanding of Madhyamaka (Middle Way) philosophy, showing his synthesis of various philosophical streams in Indian Buddhism.

### Compendium of Training (Shikshasamuccaya Compendium)

A collection of practical instructions bringing together various aspects of practice from both sutra and tantra traditions.

### Satyadvayavatara (Entry into the Two Truths)

A philosophical work elaborating on the crucial Madhyamaka concept of the two truths—conventional and ultimate reality.

### Various Ritual Texts and Commentaries

Atisha composed numerous ritual texts and commentaries that helped standardize Buddhist practice in Tibet, including works on:

- Meditation on various deities, particularly Tara
- Proper performance of rituals
- Explanations of tantric practices and vows
- Commentaries on important Indian Buddhist texts

## The Kadampa Tradition

### Founding and Early Development

Following Atisha's death, his primary Tibetan disciple, Dromtönpa, organized his teacher's lineage into what became known as the Kadampa (bka' gdams pa) tradition:

- The name means "those who take the Buddha's word (bka') as personal instruction (gdams)"
- Dromtönpa established Reting Monastery in 1056 as the main seat of the tradition
- The lineage emphasized the practical application of the Buddha's teachings in daily life
- It became known for its emphasis on ethical conduct and compassionate motivation

### The Three Lineages

The early Kadampa tradition developed into three distinct teaching lineages:

1. **Textual Tradition**: Focused on studying the classical Indian Buddhist texts
2. **Instructional Tradition**: Emphasized practical guidance for transforming the mind
3. **Oral Transmission Tradition**: Concentrated on essential pith instructions

These three aspects continued to be transmitted together or separately through subsequent generations.

### Influence on Later Schools

Although the original Kadampa tradition was eventually absorbed into the Gelug school founded by Tsongkhapa, its influence extended to all major Tibetan Buddhist traditions:

- The systematic lamrim approach was adopted across sectarian lines
- The lojong (mind training) practices became universal in Tibetan Buddhism
- The emphasis on integrating sutra and tantra shaped all subsequent Tibetan traditions
- The model of ethical foundations for advanced practice became standard

Even schools that developed in other lineages, such as the Kagyu and Nyingma, incorporated significant elements from Atisha's approach.

## Legacy and Influence

### Revitalization of Buddhism in Tibet

Atisha's greatest achievement was helping to revitalize and restructure Buddhism in Tibet during a critical period:

- He reestablished proper monastic ordination lineages
- He clarified the relationship between different aspects of Buddhist practice
- He corrected misunderstandings about tantric practice
- He provided a systematic framework for study and practice
- He helped translate and transmit important texts from India to Tibet

This revitalization established the foundations for what would become the "Second Diffusion" (phyi dar) of Buddhism in Tibet, after the earlier transmission had been disrupted.

### The Lamrim Tradition

The graduated path literature that developed from Atisha's original "Lamp for the Path" became one of the most important genres in Tibetan Buddhist literature:

- Gampopa's "Jewel Ornament of Liberation"
- Tsongkhapa's "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment"
- Countless other lamrim texts across all Tibetan traditions

These systematic presentations helped make the vast corpus of Buddhist teachings accessible and practical for generations of practitioners.

### Modern Relevance

Several aspects of Atisha's approach remain particularly relevant in contemporary Buddhist practice:

- His systematic organization of teachings makes Buddhism accessible to modern practitioners
- His integration of philosophical study with meditation practice provides a balanced approach
- His emphasis on ethics as the foundation for spiritual development addresses concerns about misconduct
- His focus on compassionate motivation speaks to those interested in engaged Buddhism
- His model of adapting teachings to different levels of understanding allows for flexible presentation

Contemporary teachers across all Tibetan traditions continue to teach according to frameworks derived from Atisha's approach.

## Critical Perspectives
