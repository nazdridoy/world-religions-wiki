- Alternatively described as born to a royal family in Oddiyana
- Some traditions state he was an emanation of Buddha Amitabha
- Adopted by King Indrabhuti of Oddiyana

### Training in India

Before coming to Tibet, Padmasambhava:

- Received teachings from great masters including Prabhahasti and Buddhaguhya
- Mastered the sutras (exoteric teachings) and tantras (esoteric teachings)

### Invitation to Tibet

King Trisong Detsen of Tibet invited the Indian abbot Shantarakshita to establish Buddhism in Tibet:

- Shantarakshita began teaching and building Samye Monastery
- Local spirits and deities created obstacles (illness, lightning, floods)

- The king sent emissaries to invite Padmasambhava to Tibet

- He performed miracles and subdued spirits at various points along his journey

### Subduing Tibet's Spirits

Upon arriving in Tibet around 747 CE:

- Padmasambhava recognized that the obstacles were caused by local deities resisting the introduction of Buddhism
- Rather than destroying these forces, he converted them to protectors of the dharma
- Bound the indigenous spirits by oath to protect Buddhist practitioners
- Integrated local deities into the Buddhist pantheon as dharmapalas (protectors)
- This syncretic approach allowed Buddhism to take root while respecting local traditions
- Demonstrated his superior spiritual power through contests with Bön practitioners
