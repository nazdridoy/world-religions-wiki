# Avalokiteshvara: The Bodhisattva of Compassion

Avalokiteshvara is one of Buddhism's most beloved and revered bodhisattvas, embodying the perfect compassion of all Buddhas. Known by different names across Asian cultures—Guanyin in China, Kannon in Japan, Chenrezig in Tibet, Quan Am in Vietnam—this bodhisattva represents the ideal of selfless compassion and the commitment to relieve suffering in all beings. Avalokiteshvara's popularity transcends sectarian boundaries, making this figure central to devotional practice across virtually all Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhist traditions.

## Name and Etymology

The name Avalokiteshvara comes from Sanskrit and carries profound meaning:
- **Avalokita**: "One who observes, looks down upon"
- **Ishvara**: "Lord" or "sovereign"

Together, the name means "The Lord Who Looks Down (with Compassion)" or "The One Who Perceives the Sounds of the World." These interpretations reflect the bodhisattva's role as one who constantly surveys the world, attentive to the cries of suffering beings.

In different languages and cultures, the bodhisattva's name varies:
- **Chenrezig** (Tibetan): "Eye of Compassion"
- **Guanyin/Kuan Yin** (Chinese): "Perceiver of Sounds"
