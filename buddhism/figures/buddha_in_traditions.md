# Buddha in Different Traditions

The Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, stands as the central figure in all Buddhist traditions, yet his portrayal, significance, and the understanding of his nature vary remarkably across different schools of Buddhism. As Buddhism spread across Asia and more recently to Western societies, various cultural, philosophical, and historical factors have influenced how the Buddha is conceptualized, depicted, and venerated. These differences reflect the diverse ways Buddhist traditions have addressed fundamental questions about enlightenment, the relationship between humanity and divinity, and the nature of religious authority.

## Historical Buddha vs. Trans-historical Buddha

### The Historical Perspective

All Buddhist traditions acknowledge Siddhartha Gautama as a historical figure who lived in ancient India around the 5th-4th centuries BCE. However, they differ in how they balance this historical understanding with more transcendent conceptions:

- **Early Buddhism** (as represented in the Pali Canon) emphasizes the Buddha as a human teacher who discovered the path to enlightenment through his own efforts
- **Later developments** increasingly portrayed the Buddha in more exalted, cosmic, or divine terms
- This tension between historical and trans-historical views of the Buddha remains a defining feature across Buddhist traditions

### The Buddha's Biography

While the basic outlines of the Buddha's biography are largely consistent across traditions, significant differences emerge in emphasis and interpretation:

#### Early Life

- **Common elements**: Born as Prince Siddhartha to King Suddhodana and Queen Maya in Lumbini; raised in luxury; sheltered from suffering

- **Vajrayana interpretations**: View these events as conscious choices by an already enlightened being

#### The Great Departure

- **Common narrative**: Encountering the "four sights" (old person, sick person, corpse, and ascetic); leaving palace life to seek enlightenment
- **Theravada interpretation**: Highlights the rational decision to seek liberation from suffering

## The Buddha in Early Buddhist Schools

### Theravada View of the Buddha

The Theravada tradition, dominant in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, maintains what is often considered the most historically-oriented view of the Buddha:

#### Buddha as Teacher and Exemplar

- Emphasizes the Buddha as a human being who attained enlightenment through his own efforts
- Views the Buddha primarily as a supreme teacher (satthā) rather than a savior
- Honors the Buddha as the discoverer of the path that others can follow
- Stresses his role as spiritual physician diagnosing suffering and prescribing its cure

#### The Buddha's Qualities

Theravada tradition emphasizes three primary aspects of the Buddha:

- **Wisdom** (paññā): Perfect understanding of the nature of reality
- **Purity** (visuddhi): Complete freedom from mental defilements
- **Compassion** (karuṇā): Deep concern for the welfare of all beings

#### Special Characteristics

Theravada tradition recognizes exceptional qualities of the Buddha that distinguish him from ordinary beings and even arhats:

- **32 major marks** (mahāpurisa-lakkhaṇa): Physical characteristics of a great being
- **80 minor characteristics**: Additional physical attributes of beauty and perfection
- **Ten powers** (dasabala): Special knowledges including understanding karma and paths to liberation
- **Four fearlessnesses** (vesārajja): Confidence in his awakening, elimination of defilements, identification of obstacles, and teaching the path to liberation
- **18 unshared qualities**: Attributes unique to a fully enlightened Buddha

### Early Doctrinal Developments

As Buddhism developed in India, various early schools formed different understandings of the Buddha:

#### Sarvastivada View

- Developed the concept of the Buddha having multiple bodies
- Distinguished between the physical form (rūpakāya) and the body of qualities (dharmakāya)
- Laid groundwork for later Mahayana developments of the trikāya (three bodies) doctrine

#### Mahāsāṃghika Perspective

- Tended toward a more transcendent view of the Buddha
- Suggested the historical Buddha was a manifestation of a transcendent reality
- Proposed that the Buddha's physical body (rūpakāya) was limitless and his lifespan infinite
- These ideas influenced later Mahayana concepts of the sambhogakāya (enjoyment body)

#### Docetism in Early Buddhism

Some early schools developed proto-docetic views (that the Buddha only appeared to be human):

- Suggested the Buddha did not actually experience hunger, thirst, or other human limitations
- Proposed that his human appearance was an accommodated teaching method
- These views eventually contributed to Mahayana doctrines of skillful means (upāya)

## The Buddha in Mahayana Traditions

### Fundamental Shifts in Buddha Conception

Mahayana Buddhism, which emerged around the 1st century BCE, developed significantly different views of the Buddha:

#### The Trikāya Doctrine

The "three bodies" doctrine became central to Mahayana understanding:

- **Dharmakāya** (truth body): The Buddha as ultimate reality; formless, omnipresent, and identical with emptiness itself
- **Sambhogakāya** (enjoyment body): Celestial form in which buddhas appear to advanced bodhisattvas in buddha-fields
- **Nirmāṇakāya** (emanation body): Physical manifestations in the world, including the historical Buddha

#### Buddha-Nature (Tathāgatagarbha)

Mahayana traditions developed the concept that all beings possess buddha-nature:

- The inherent potential for buddhahood exists within all sentient beings
- The historical Buddha represents the actualization of what is potential in everyone
- This doctrine shifts focus from the Buddha as unique figure to exemplar of universal potential

#### Multiple Buddhas

Unlike early Buddhism which emphasized the rarity of buddhas, Mahayana traditions recognize:

- Buddhas of the past, such as Dīpaṃkara
- Buddhas of other realms currently teaching, such as Akshobhya and Amitabha
- Future buddhas, most notably Maitreya
- The possibility of countless buddhas throughout the universe

- Direct identification with the Buddha through ritual practice

#### Kamakura Period Innovations
