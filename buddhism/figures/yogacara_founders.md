# Asanga and Vasubandhu: Founders of the Yogacara School

Asanga (4th-5th century CE) and Vasubandhu (4th-5th century CE) were two brother-scholars who profoundly shaped Buddhist philosophy through their founding and development of the Yogacara ("Yoga Practice") school, one of the two major Mahayana philosophical traditions alongside Madhyamaka. Also known as Cittamatra ("Mind-Only") or Vijñanavada ("Consciousness Way"), the Yogacara school established a sophisticated psychological and epistemological framework for understanding consciousness, perception, and the path to enlightenment.

## Historical Context

Asanga and Vasubandhu lived during a pivotal period in Buddhist history, approximately 900-1000 years after the Buddha's parinirvana:

- The Mahayana movement had become well-established across India
- Buddhist universities like Nalanda were flourishing as centers of learning
- Philosophical discourse was sophisticated, with debates between Buddhist schools and with non-Buddhist traditions (particularly Hindu Nyaya and Samkhya)
- Tantric Buddhism was beginning to develop
- Buddhism was spreading along trade routes to Central and East Asia

## Asanga: Life and Works

### Biographical Information

Traditional accounts of Asanga's life include both historical and legendary elements:

- Born into a Brahmin family in Purusapura (modern Peshawar, Pakistan) in Gandhara
- Originally studied in the Sarvastivada/Vaibhasika tradition of early Buddhism
- After becoming dissatisfied with his understanding, he undertook intensive meditation on Maitreya Buddha
- After 12 years of practice (including periods of discouragement), he experienced a vision of Bodhisattva Maitreya
- According to tradition, he was taken to the Tusita Heaven where Maitreya revealed profound teachings to him
- He later converted his younger half-brother Vasubandhu to Mahayana Buddhism

### Major Works

Asanga's literary output established the foundation of Yogacara:

- **Yogacarabhumi-sastra** (Treatise on the Stages of Yoga Practice) - A massive compendium on practice and theory
- **Mahayanasamgraha** (Compendium of the Mahayana) - A systematic presentation of Yogacara thought
- **Abhidharmasamuccaya** (Compendium of Abhidharma) - A Mahayana reinterpretation of Abhidharma categories

He is also traditionally credited with recording five texts revealed by Maitreya:
- **Mahayanasutralankara** (Ornament of Mahayana Sutras)
- **Madhyantavibhaga** (Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes)
- **Dharmadharmatavibhaga** (Distinguishing Phenomena from Their Nature)
- **Abhisamayalankara** (Ornament of Clear Realization)
- **Ratnagotravibhaga** (Analysis of the Jewel Lineage, also known as Uttaratantra)

## Vasubandhu: Life and Works

### Biographical Information

Vasubandhu's life represents a fascinating intellectual journey:

- Younger half-brother of Asanga, likely born in Purusapura (Peshawar)
- Initially trained in Sarvastivada/Vaibhasika Buddhism, becoming one of its foremost scholars
- Authored the Abhidharmakosa, a masterpiece systematizing Sarvastivada Abhidharma
- Later wrote a self-critique (Abhidharmakosabhasya) showing affinity for Sautrantika views
- Eventually converted to Mahayana Buddhism, allegedly through Asanga's influence
- Became a prolific writer and commentator within the Yogacara tradition
- Traditional accounts describe him as having an exceptional intellect and photographic memory

### Major Works

Vasubandhu's extensive writings span pre-Mahayana and Mahayana thought:

**Early/Abhidharma Period:**
- **Abhidharmakosa and Bhasya** (Treasury of Abhidharma with Commentary) - His masterwork systematizing Abhidharma philosophy

**Yogacara Period:**
- **Vimsatika** (Twenty Verses on Consciousness-Only)
- **Trimsika** (Thirty Verses on Consciousness-Only)
- **Madhyantavibhaga-bhasya** (Commentary on Distinguishing the Middle from Extremes)
- **Trisvabhava-nirdesa** (Treatise on the Three Natures)

**Commentary Period:**
- Commentaries on Mahayana sutras, including the Dasabhumika Sutra and Lotus Sutra
- **Vyakhyayukti** (Principles of Explanation) on hermeneutics

## Yogacara Philosophy

Through their combined intellectual efforts, Asanga and Vasubandhu developed a comprehensive philosophical system:

### Core Doctrines

**Eight Consciousness Model:**
- The six traditional consciousnesses: visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and mental
- Manas (seventh consciousness): self-reflexive aspect of consciousness
- Alayavijñana (eighth consciousness): "storehouse consciousness" that stores karmic seeds

**Three Natures (Trisvabhava):**
- Parikalpita (Imagined Nature): false projections and conceptual constructions
- Paratantra (Dependent Nature): dependent co-arising of phenomena
- Parinispanna (Perfected Nature): true nature of reality, emptiness

**Consciousness-Only (Cittamatra):**
- The understanding that what we experience as "external reality" is actually projection of consciousness
- Famous statement: "The three realms are mind-only" (Traidhatuka vijñaptimatra)
- Not a denial of external objects but a refutation of subject-object duality

**Transformation of Consciousness:**
- Asraya-paravrtti: the "turning around" of consciousness at the base
- Conversion of the eighth consciousness into Mirror-like Wisdom
- Detailed developmental model of the path to enlightenment

### Relationship to Madhyamaka

While often contrasted with Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka school:
- Yogacara focused on the subjective/experiential side of emptiness
- Addressed psychological processes that perpetuate samsara
- Provided a more detailed phenomenology of consciousness
- Later traditions (especially in Tibet) would attempt to synthesize the two approaches

## Historical Impact and Legacy

Asanga and Vasubandhu profoundly influenced Buddhist thought across Asia:

### In India

- Their works became core curriculum at Buddhist universities like Nalanda
- Inspired subsequent thinkers like Dignaga and Dharmakirti who developed Buddhist logic
- Influenced the development of Indian Tantric Buddhism
- Created an epistemological system that engaged with other Indian philosophical traditions

### In China

- Yogacara was introduced to China as the Faxiang (法相, Dharma-character) school
- Xuanzang traveled to India specifically to study Yogacara texts
- After returning to China, Xuanzang translated many works by Asanga and Vasubandhu
- The Cheng Weishi Lun (成唯識論, Treatise on the Establishment of Consciousness-Only) became a central text
- Influenced development of Huayan and Chan Buddhism

### In Tibet

- Yogacara texts were translated during both early and later transmission periods
- Their thinking became integrated into the Tibetan Shedra (monastic college) curriculum
- The Abhisamayalankara became one of the "Five Treatises of Maitreya" central to monastic education
- Yogacara concepts were synthesized with Madhyamaka, especially in the Shentong view

### In East Asia

- Influenced Korean Beopsang school and Japanese Hossō school
- Concepts incorporated into Japanese Tendai and Shingon Buddhism
- Impacted Zen through works like the Lankavatara Sutra which blend Yogacara and Buddha-nature teachings

## Philosophical Contributions

The brothers' philosophical innovations extended well beyond Buddhism:

### Mind and Consciousness

- Developed perhaps the most sophisticated model of mind in ancient India
- Created a phenomenological approach to consciousness that predated Western phenomenology by 1500 years
- Explored the relationship between consciousness and its objects
- Described subliminal consciousness centuries before Western psychology

### Epistemology

- Formulated sophisticated theories of perception and knowledge
- Developed concepts of direct perception versus conceptual construction
- Established a foundation for later Buddhist logicians like Dignaga and Dharmakirti
- Addressed how valid knowledge can be obtained in a world of projected experience

### Buddhist Practice

- Created systematic frameworks integrating philosophical theory with meditation practice
- Mapped detailed stages of the bodhisattva path
- Explained how conceptual understanding transforms into direct realization
- Described how emptiness is actually experienced, not just understood intellectually

## Contemporary Relevance

The philosophical systems of Asanga and Vasubandhu continue to have relevance:

- **Cognitive Science**: Their analysis of consciousness offers dialogue points with modern theories of mind
- **Psychology**: Their understanding of how mental projections create suffering parallels some therapeutic approaches
- **Phenomenology**: Their detailed descriptions of experience resonate with Western phenomenological traditions
- **Meditation Research**: Their accounts of attention training and mindfulness provide frameworks for contemporary practice
- **Interdependent Reality**: Their views on the constructed nature of experience offer insights into current discussions of post-truth and virtual reality
