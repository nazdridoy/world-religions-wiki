# Arhats: The Enlightened Disciples

In Buddhist tradition, arhats (Sanskrit: arhat; Pali: arahant) are enlightened disciples who have achieved liberation from the cycle of rebirth (samsara) through following the Buddha's teachings. The term "arhat" literally means "worthy one" or "deserving of offerings," indicating their high spiritual attainment and venerable status within the Buddhist community.

## Definition and Significance

### The Concept of Arhatship

In early Buddhism and particularly in the Theravada tradition, arhatship represents the highest spiritual goal:

- An arhat has eliminated all defilements (klesha) and mental afflictions
- Has completely uprooted greed, hatred, and delusion
- Has gained direct insight into the Four Noble Truths
- Will no longer be reborn after death (parinirvana)
- Has attained the same essential enlightenment as the Buddha (though with differences in scope)

The Buddha himself is considered the first and foremost arhat, though he is distinguished from others by his self-awakening without a teacher and his ability to establish the dharma in the world.

### Arhats in Different Buddhist Traditions

While the concept of the arhat is central to all Buddhist schools, traditions differ in their emphasis:

- **Theravada**: Considers arhatship the ultimate goal of practice
- **Mahayana**: Often contrasts the arhat ideal with the bodhisattva ideal, seeing the latter as more comprehensive
- **East Asian Buddhism**: Developed specific veneration practices for groups of arhats
- **Tibetan Buddhism**: Incorporates arhats into Buddhist pantheon while emphasizing the bodhisattva path

## The Sixteen (or Eighteen) Arhats

A specific tradition developed, especially in East Asian Buddhism, venerating a group of arhats who were entrusted by the Buddha to remain in the world to protect the dharma until the coming of Maitreya, the future Buddha. This group is commonly depicted in Buddhist art, temple halls, and religious ceremonies.

### Origins of the Tradition

The tradition of the sixteen or eighteen arhats evolved over time:

- Initially based on a text called the "Record of the Duration of the Law, Spoken by the Great Arhat Nandimitra" (Chinese: Nandi mi duo luo suo shuo fa zhu ji)
- Translated into Chinese in the early 7th century CE
- Originally featured sixteen arhats, expanded to eighteen in China with the addition of Nandimitra himself and Pindola Bharadvaja
- Further expanded to 500 arhats in some traditions, representing the 500 great disciples mentioned in sutras

## Veneration and Practice

The arhats are not merely historical or artistic figures but continue to play important roles in Buddhist practice:

### Ritual Veneration

- **China**: Regular offerings made to arhat halls in temples
- **Japan**: Binzuru (Pindola) statues often touched by devotees seeking healing
- **Tibet**: Included in lineage devotions and refuge practices
- **Southeast Asia**: Featured in temple murals and educational stories about the Buddha's disciples

### Practice Significance

The arhats serve several purposes in Buddhist practice:

- **Models of attainment**: Demonstrating that enlightenment is achievable
- **Diverse examples**: Showing that people of different backgrounds and abilities can achieve liberation
- **Connection to the Buddha**: Representing direct links to the historical Buddha's teaching
- **Protectors**: Believed to provide protection to sincere practitioners
- **Inspiration**: Stories of their struggles and achievements inspire practitioners

## Stories and Legends

Rich traditions of stories surround each arhat, emphasizing their unique qualities and attainments:

### Pindola Bharadvaja

One of the most famous stories concerns Pindola, who used supernatural powers to retrieve a sandalwood bowl placed atop a high pole by a wealthy merchant as a challenge. The Buddha rebuked him for displaying supernatural powers to laypeople and, as a punishment, commanded him to remain in the world until the coming of Maitreya Buddha to serve as a "field of merit" for devotees.

### Cudapanthaka

Cudapanthaka (Chudapanthaka) was known for his poor memory. His brother, frustrated with his inability to memorize even a single verse, expelled him from the monastery. The Buddha gave him a simple task of repeatedly reciting "sweep clean, remove the dust." Through this concentrated practice, he realized the deeper meaning—removing the dust of defilements from the mind—and achieved enlightenment.

### Rahula

As the Buddha's son, Rahula has special significance. When he joined the Sangha as a child, he was known for his strict adherence to rules and practices. The Buddha composed specific teachings for him, including the famous "Advice to Rahula" (Ambalaṭṭhikārāhulovāda Sutta), on the importance of truthfulness and constant reflection on one's actions.

## Theological Perspectives

### Theravada View

In Theravada Buddhism, the arhat represents the ideal spiritual attainment:

- Completely liberated from all defilements and karma
- Has achieved the same enlightenment as the Buddha in terms of liberation from suffering
- Differs from the Buddha primarily in not having discovered the path independently
- May not possess all the special knowledges (abhiññā) that the Buddha possessed

### Mahayana View

Mahayana Buddhism often contrasts the arhat with the bodhisattva ideal:

- Arhats are seen as having achieved individual liberation but lacking the great compassion of bodhisattvas
- Sometimes characterized as having a "lesser vehicle" (Hinayana) motivation focused on personal liberation
- Often depicted as needing further development to achieve complete buddhahood
- Nevertheless respected as realized beings who have overcome suffering

### Cultural Adaptations

The concept of the arhat has adapted to different cultural contexts:

- **China**: Arhats sometimes took on characteristics of Daoist immortals
- **Tibet**: Integrated into tantric practice systems while maintaining their connection to early Buddhism
- **Japan**: Frequently associated with Zen Buddhism and depicted with humorous or eccentric qualities
- **Southeast Asia**: Often linked to local guardian spirits and protective deities

## Contemporary Relevance

The tradition of the arhats continues to have significance in contemporary Buddhism:

- **Temple architecture**: Arhat halls remain important features of East Asian Buddhist temples
- **Meditation practice**: Stories of arhats' meditation achievements provide guidance for practitioners
- **Popular Buddhism**: Arhats feature in popular Buddhist literature, art, and even entertainment
- **Ecumenical Buddhism**: The arhat tradition provides a common reference point across different schools
