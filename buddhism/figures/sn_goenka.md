## Biography

### Early Life in Burma

Satya Narayan Goenka was born on January 30, 1924, in Mandalay, Burma (now Myanmar), to a wealthy Indian business family of the conservative Hindu Marwari community. His family had emigrated from India to Burma, where they established successful businesses. As the eldest son, Goenka was groomed to take over the family enterprises, receiving education in both traditional Indian and Western subjects.

Despite his Hindu upbringing, Goenka grew up in Burma's predominantly Buddhist culture. He became a successful businessman, leading over 40 companies and serving as the president of the Burma Chamber of Commerce. He was also active in the local Indian community, holding leadership positions in several cultural and business organizations.

### Health Crisis and Turn to Meditation

By his early thirties, Goenka had developed severe, debilitating migraines that Western medical treatments failed to cure. Despite his wealth and success, these headaches dramatically affected his quality of life and work capabilities. After exhausting conventional medical options, he was introduced to Sayagyi U Ba Khin, a Burmese government official who taught Vipassana meditation.

In 1955, Goenka attended his first 10-day Vipassana course under U Ba Khin's guidance, primarily seeking relief from his physical suffering. The meditation practice not only helped alleviate his migraines but also initiated a profound spiritual transformation. He continued studying with U Ba Khin for the next 14 years, balancing his business responsibilities with deepening meditation practice.

### Leaving Burma and Beginning to Teach

In 1969, at the age of 45, Goenka received authorization from U Ba Khin to teach Vipassana meditation. That same year, political changes in Burma made it increasingly difficult for people of Indian origin to maintain businesses there. Goenka moved to India, the land of his ancestors but a country he had never lived in before.

Rather than reestablishing his business career in India, Goenka decided to dedicate himself to teaching meditation. He conducted his first 10-day Vipassana course in Mumbai in 1969, marking the beginning of his teaching career that would span more than four decades.

### Establishing a Global Meditation Movement

Starting from humble beginnings in India, Goenka's teaching gradually expanded:

- In 1976, he established the first permanent Vipassana meditation center, Dhamma Giri, in Igatpuri, India
- In 1979, he began traveling internationally, teaching in various countries
- By the 1980s, he had trained assistant teachers to help meet growing demand
- In 1985, the first Western Vipassana center was established in Massachusetts, USA
- Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the number of centers and courses expanded dramatically worldwide
- By the time of his death in 2013, his organization had established over 170 permanent meditation centers across six continents

## Teaching Approach and Method

### Vipassana Technique

Goenka taught Vipassana (insight) meditation as preserved in the Theravada Buddhist tradition but presented in a non-sectarian format accessible to people of all backgrounds:

- **Foundation in morality**: Courses begin with commitment to five moral precepts
- **Anapana meditation**: Initial focus on breath awareness to develop concentration
- **Body scanning**: Systematic observation of bodily sensations from head to feet
- **Equanimous observation**: Developing non-reactive awareness of changing sensations
- **Metta bhavana**: Concluding practice of loving-kindness meditation

The technique is taught exclusively through 10-day residential courses where participants:
- Observe complete silence for nine days
- Meditate for approximately 10 hours daily
- Follow a structured timetable from 4:30 AM to 9:30 PM
- Abstain from reading, writing, electronic devices, and external communications
- Listen to Goenka's instructions via audio/video recordings

- Stripping away ritual elements while maintaining the core meditation methodology
- Emphasizing direct experience over blind faith
- Using scientific language and rational explanations
- Making the technique accessible to people of all faiths and backgrounds
- Offering courses at no charge (running entirely on donations from past students)

### Teaching Style

Goenka developed a distinctive teaching style characterized by:

- Recorded evening discourses explaining the theory behind the practice
- Clear, step-by-step meditation instructions
