# Bodhidharma: Father of Zen Buddhism

Bodhidharma (Sanskrit: बोधिधर्म; Chinese: 菩提達摩; Japanese: 達磨 Daruma) was a semi-legendary Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th or 6th century CE. He is traditionally credited with transmitting Chan Buddhism to China and is regarded as its first Chinese patriarch. Known for his intense meditation practices, enigmatic teaching style, and iconic appearance, Bodhidharma remains one of the most influential and mysterious figures in Buddhist history.

## Historical Context

Bodhidharma lived during a transformative period in Buddhist history:

- Buddhism had been present in China for several centuries but was still adapting to Chinese culture
- The Northern and Southern Dynasties period (420-589 CE) was marked by political division
- Various Buddhist schools were developing, with significant philosophical debates occurring
- Translation of Buddhist texts from Sanskrit to Chinese was ongoing
- Indigenous Chinese philosophical traditions (Confucianism and Daoism) were interacting with Buddhist concepts

## Historical Sources and Challenges

Reconstructing the historical Bodhidharma presents significant challenges:

- Earliest reliable reference appears in the "Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks" (續高僧傳, Xu Gaoseng Zhuan) compiled by Daoxuan in 645 CE
- Later accounts progressively added legendary elements to his biography
- The "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall" (祖堂集, Zutang ji) from 952 CE contains more developed legends
- "The Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp" (景德傳燈錄, Jingde Chuandeng Lu) from 1004 CE further elaborated his story
- Historical accounts are intertwined with hagiography and legend
- Different traditions attribute varying dates and details to his life

## Traditional Biography

### Origins and Early Life

According to traditional accounts:

- Born as a prince in the southern Indian kingdom of Pallava (modern Tamil Nadu)
- Alternatively described as the third son of a Brahmin king from Kanchipuram
- Some sources give his royal name as Bodhitara
- Studied Buddhism under Prajnatara (his teacher and the 27th patriarch in the lineage from the Buddha)
- Received dharma transmission from Prajnatara, becoming the 28th patriarch
- Instructed by his teacher to travel to China to spread the true dharma

### Journey to China

The journey to China is described in various ways:

- Arrived in Guangzhou (Canton) during the Liu Song dynasty or Liang dynasty
- Some accounts claim he arrived during the Northern Wei Dynasty
- Traditional dates range from 475 to 520 CE

### Meeting with Emperor Wu

One of the most famous stories about Bodhidharma involves his meeting with Emperor Wu of Liang:

- Emperor Wu was a fervent Buddhist patron who built temples and supported the sangha
- The emperor asked Bodhidharma how much merit he had accumulated through these good works
- Bodhidharma replied, "None whatsoever" (absolutely no merit)
- When asked who was standing before the emperor, Bodhidharma replied, "I don't know" (不識, bu shi)
- Confused and disappointed by these responses, Emperor Wu dismissed him
- This encounter illustrates the Chan emphasis on direct insight over ritual or intellectual understanding

### Shaolin Monastery and Nine Years of Wall-Gazing

After leaving the emperor's court:

- Crossed the Yangtze River on a reed (a scene frequently depicted in East Asian art)
- Traveled to the northern kingdom of Wei
- Arrived at Shaolin Monastery on Mount Song
- Found the monks there physically weak and unable to maintain lengthy meditation
- Sat facing a wall in meditation for nine years (壁觀, bi guan)
- During this time, his legs allegedly atrophied
- This extended meditation became emblematic of Zen's emphasis on seated meditation (zazen)

### Disciples and Dharma Transmission

Bodhidharma eventually accepted disciples:

- Dazu Huike (慧可, 487-593 CE) became his primary successor
- According to legend, Huike stood in the snow and cut off his arm to demonstrate his determination
- Other disciples included Daoyu and the nun Zongchi
- Before his death, Bodhidharma asked his disciples to express their understanding of his teaching
- Only Huike's answer satisfied him, leading to the dharma transmission
- Bodhidharma gave Huike his robe and bowl as symbols of the transmission
- This established the tradition of dharma transmission that continues in Zen Buddhism today

### Death and Aftermath

Accounts of Bodhidharma's death vary:

- Some say he died at Shaolin Monastery around 535-536 CE
- Other accounts claim he was poisoned by jealous rivals
- A famous legend states that he returned to India or was seen walking back toward Central Asia with one sandal
- Years after his supposed death, a Chinese official reportedly encountered him in the mountains of Central Asia
- When his tomb was later opened, it allegedly contained only a single sandal

## Physical Appearance and Iconography

Bodhidharma is depicted with distinctive features in East Asian art:

- Intense, wide-eyed stare (often bulging eyes)
- Thick beard and bushy eyebrows
- Dark complexion indicating his Indian origin
- Earrings reflecting his royal background
- Hooded robe pulled over his head
- Often shown crossing the Yangtze on a reed

## Teachings and Legacy

### Central Teachings

Bodhidharma's teaching emphasized:

1. **Direct pointing to the mind** (直指人心, zhí zhǐ rén xīn)
2. **Seeing one's nature and attaining Buddhahood** (見性成佛, jiàn xìng chéng fó)
3. **Non-reliance on words and scriptures** (不立文字, bú lì wén zì)
4. **Special transmission outside the scriptures** (教外別傳, jiào wài bié chuán)

These four principles became foundational to Chan/Zen Buddhism.

### The Two Entrances and Four Practices

The earliest text attributed to Bodhidharma, "The Two Entrances and Four Practices" (二入四行論, Èr rù sì xíng lùn), outlines his practical approach:

1. **Entrance by Principle**: Directly realizing the true nature of mind through wall-gazing meditation
2. **Entrance by Practice**: Four specific practices for cultivation:
   - Accepting suffering as repayment of karmic debts
   - Following conditions without attachment
   - Seeking nothing outside oneself
   - Practicing in accord with the Dharma

### Attributed Texts

Several texts are traditionally attributed to Bodhidharma, though modern scholarship questions their authenticity:

- "The Two Entrances and Four Practices" (二入四行論)
- "The Bloodstream Sermon" (血脈論, Xuèmài lùn)
- "The Wake-up Sermon" (悟性論, Wùxìng lùn)
- "The Breakthrough Sermon" (破相論, Pòxiàng lùn)

These texts emphasize direct insight into Buddha-nature and the transcendence of conceptual thinking.

### Martial Arts Connection

Bodhidharma is traditionally credited with:

- Introducing exercises to strengthen Shaolin monks for meditation
- Teaching the "Muscle/Tendon Change Classic" (易筋經, Yì jīn jīng)
- Founding Shaolin martial arts and by extension influencing many East Asian martial arts
- Establishing the connection between spiritual practice and physical discipline

Modern historians generally view these attributions as later legends developed to connect martial arts with prestigious Buddhist lineages.
