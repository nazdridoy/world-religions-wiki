## Early Life and Path to Buddhism

### Before Buddhism

Pema Chödrön was born Deirdre Blomfield-Brown in New York City in 1936. Before encountering Buddhism, she lived what appeared to be a conventional American life:

- Graduated from the University of California, Berkeley
- Worked as an elementary school teacher
- Married and had two children
- Lived in California and New Mexico

Her life took a dramatic turn in her early thirties when her second marriage ended abruptly when her husband informed her he was having an affair and wanted a divorce. This personal crisis became a pivotal moment in her spiritual journey. As she later recounted, it was "the rug being pulled out from under me that set me on a spiritual path."

### Encounter with Buddhism

While recovering from her divorce, Chödrön discovered Buddhist teachings:

- Read an article by Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche in a magazine
- Was struck by his approach to embracing life's difficulties rather than trying to escape them
- Began studying with Trungpa Rinpoche in 1974
- Found that Buddhist teachings provided a framework for working with her painful emotions

- Ordained as a novice Buddhist nun in 1974 under Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, the 16th Karmapa
- Received full ordination in the Chinese lineage of Buddhism in 1981
