# Emperor Ashoka: Champion of Buddhism

Ashoka (Sanskrit: अशोक, Pali: Asoka, 304-232 BCE), also known as Ashoka the Great, was the third emperor of the Mauryan Dynasty who ruled almost the entire Indian subcontinent from c. 268 to 232 BCE. After witnessing the tremendous suffering caused by his own military conquest of Kalinga (modern-day Odisha), Ashoka underwent a profound personal transformation, converting to Buddhism and dedicating the remainder of his reign to spreading dharma. His patronage and advocacy of Buddhism transformed it from a regional faith into a world religion with lasting influence across Asia and eventually the globe.

## Early Life and Rise to Power

### Royal Origins

- Born around 304 BCE to Emperor Bindusara and Subhadrangi (also called Dharma)
- Grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Mauryan Empire
- According to Buddhist chronicles, his birth name was Devanampiya Piyadasi ("Beloved of the Gods")
- Received military and administrative training as a prince
- Served as governor of Ujjain and Taxila during his father's reign

### Path to the Throne

Traditional accounts suggest Ashoka's path to power was not straightforward:

- Not the crown prince but one among many sons of Bindusara
- According to some accounts, emerged victorious after a four-year succession struggle following his father's death in 272 BCE
- Buddhist texts claim he killed ninety-nine half-brothers, sparing only one, to secure the throne
- While these accounts may be exaggerated, historians believe there was likely a contested succession
- Formally ascended the throne around 268 BCE

### Early Reign and Military Conquests

The early years of Ashoka's reign continued the expansionist policies of his predecessors:

- Inherited a vast empire that included most of present-day India, Bangladesh, and parts of Afghanistan
- Maintained a large standing army and efficient administrative system
- Expanded Mauryan control through military campaigns
- Culminated in the Kalinga War (c. 261 BCE) against the independent state on India's eastern coast

## The Kalinga War and Conversion

### The Turning Point

The conquest of Kalinga marked the pivotal moment in Ashoka's life:

- A massive and brutal military campaign resulting in complete Mauryan victory
- According to Ashoka's own accounts in his edicts, the war caused immense suffering:
  - 100,000 people were killed in battle
  - 150,000 were deported
  - Many more died from injuries, starvation, and disease

### Remorse and Transformation

Ashoka's 13th major rock edict describes his profound remorse after witnessing the devastation:

> "When an unconquered country is conquered, people are killed... that the beloved of the gods finds extremely painful and grievous. ...the slaughter, death and deportation of people is extremely grievous to the beloved of the gods."

This experience led to a spiritual crisis and transformation:

- Embraced Buddhism, likely influenced by the monk Upagupta or Nigrodha
- Renounced violent conquest and dedicated himself to dharma (moral law)
- Vowed to rule through moral example rather than force
- Expressed deep regret for the suffering he had caused

## Dharma: Ashoka's Ethical Framework

### Ashoka's Conception of Dharma

While influenced by Buddhism, Ashoka's dharma (dhamma in Pali) was a broader ethical framework:

- Emphasized moral conduct, tolerance, and non-violence
- Promoted respect for all religions and philosophical traditions
- Encouraged kindness to humans and animals
- Advocated for restraint in consumption and expenditure
- Valued generosity toward ascetics, brahmins, the poor, and the elderly
- Stressed honesty, truthfulness, and self-examination

From Rock Edict III:

> "One should respect one's father and mother, likewise one's teachers; one should have compassion for all living creatures; one should speak the truth; and these same moral virtues should be practiced."

### Not Strictly Sectarian Buddhism

Although a Buddhist himself, Ashoka's official policy was more inclusive:

- Supported multiple religious traditions
- Emphasized ethical conduct over doctrine
- Encouraged sectarian harmony
- Focused on universal values shared across traditions

## Propagation of Buddhism

### Domestic Promotion

Within his empire, Ashoka actively supported Buddhism through:

- Construction of 84,000 stupas and viharas (monastic dwellings) across the subcontinent
- Establishment of the Great Stupa at Sanchi (which survives to this day)
- Preservation of Buddha relics in prominent monuments
- Pilgrimage to Buddhist sites, including Lumbini (birthplace of the Buddha)
- Support for the monastic community (Sangha)
- Regular convening of Buddhist councils and discussions
- Appointment of dhamma-mahamatras (ministers of dharma) to promote moral conduct

### The Third Buddhist Council

Ashoka reportedly sponsored the Third Buddhist Council at Pataliputra around 250 BCE:

- Presided over by the monk Moggaliputta Tissa
- Worked to purify the Sangha of corruption and factional disputes
- Codified Buddhist doctrine to resolve disputes
- Produced the Kathavatthu, a text addressing points of controversy
- Helped establish Theravada Buddhism as a distinct tradition

### Missionary Activity

Ashoka initiated the first organized missionary efforts to spread Buddhism beyond India:

- Sent emissaries to Hellenistic kingdoms in the west, including Syria, Egypt, Cyrene, Macedonia, and Epirus
- Dispatched his son Mahinda and daughter Sanghamitta to Sri Lanka, successfully establishing Buddhism there
- Sent missions to Southeast Asia, laying groundwork for Buddhism's later flourishing
- Established connections with Central Asia, creating pathways for Buddhism's spread to China

## Ashoka's Governance Innovations

### The Pillar and Rock Edicts

One of Ashoka's most remarkable innovations was the public inscription of his policies and principles:

- Major rock edicts carved into natural rock formations
- Pillar edicts inscribed on specially carved columns
- Minor rock edicts in various locations
- Special cave inscriptions
- These used multiple languages and scripts to reach different populations
- Emphasized ethical governance, religious tolerance, and social welfare

### Administrative Reforms

Ashoka implemented several governance innovations:

- Established regular tours of his empire to understand his subjects' conditions
- Created a system of "voice to the voiceless" through accessibility to royal authority
- Instituted public works projects including:
  - Roads with shade trees and rest houses
  - Medical facilities for humans and animals
  - Wells and watering stations
  - Veterinary clinics
- Reformed judicial system to ensure fairness and reduce harsh punishments

### Animal Welfare and Environmental Protection

Uniquely for his time, Ashoka extended ethical consideration to animals:

- Banned unnecessary animal slaughter for royal kitchens
- Restricted hunting practices
- Established veterinary hospitals
- Protected certain species from killing
- Created sanctuaries for animals
- Promoted vegetarianism (though did not mandate it)
- Planted medicinal herbs and trees throughout the empire

## Historical Legacy

### Decline and Fall of the Mauryan Empire

Despite Ashoka's achievements, the Mauryan Empire began to decline after his death:

- Died around 232 BCE after ruling for approximately 36 years
- Empire fragmented under his less capable successors
- By 185 BCE, the last Mauryan ruler was overthrown by Pushyamitra Shunga
- Some scholars debate whether Ashoka's focus on non-violence weakened the empire militarily

### Forgotten and Rediscovered

Remarkably, Ashoka was largely forgotten in India until modern times:

- His edicts became unreadable as the Brahmi script fell out of use
- Hindu and Jain traditions preserved little information about him
- Buddhist traditions outside India maintained legends of "Ashoka the Great"
- Only in the 19th century did British archaeologists and scholars like James Prinsep decipher the Brahmi script
- This led to the rediscovery of Ashoka's historical significance

### Modern Significance

Today, Ashoka is recognized as one of India's greatest rulers:

- The Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath has become the national emblem of India
- The 24-spoked Ashoka Chakra appears on the Indian national flag
- His reign represents an ideal of enlightened leadership in modern Indian political discourse
- His advocacy of religious tolerance, non-violence, and welfare policies resonates in contemporary ethics
- Organizations worldwide have adopted his name to symbolize social entrepreneurship and ethical governance

## Ashoka in Buddhist Tradition

### The Ashokavadana

Buddhist texts, particularly the Ashokavadana (Narrative of Ashoka), preserve a semi-legendary account of his life:

- Portrays him initially as "Chandashoka" (Fierce Ashoka) who was cruel and violent
- Transforms into "Dharmashoka" (Righteous Ashoka) after conversion
- Includes miraculous events and divine interventions
- Emphasizes his role in preserving and spreading Buddha's teachings
- Describes his collection and redistribution of Buddha's relics

### Different Buddhist Traditions' Views

Various Buddhist traditions honor Ashoka differently:

- Theravada tradition (Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia) venerates him for supporting the "orthodox" lineage
- East Asian traditions preserve legends of his supernatural powers and miraculous deeds
- Tibetan Buddhism includes accounts of his building activities and sponsorship of Buddhism
- All agree on his critical role in Buddhism's development from a regional into a world religion
