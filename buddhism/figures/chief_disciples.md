# Sariputta and Moggallana: The Buddha's Chief Disciples

Sariputta (Pali; Sanskrit: Śāriputra) and Moggallana (Pali; Sanskrit: Maudgalyāyana) are revered in Buddhist tradition as the Buddha's two chief disciples. Their complementary strengths and lifelong friendship created a powerful partnership that helped establish Buddhism during its formative period. While Sariputta was renowned for his profound wisdom and analytical abilities, Moggallana was celebrated for his extraordinary psychic powers and meditation mastery. Together, they exemplified the ideal of spiritual friendship and represented two complementary paths to enlightenment.

## Early Life and Friendship

### Background and Youth

- Both were born to Brahmin families near Rajagaha (modern Rajgir) in the ancient kingdom of Magadha
- Sariputta, born Upatissa, was named after his mother Sari
- Moggallana, born Kolita, was named after his clan
- From childhood, they were close friends from neighboring villages
- Both received traditional Brahmin education and were well-versed in Vedic literature

### Spiritual Quest Together

As young men, they became dissatisfied with the worldly pleasures and entertainments of their privileged background:

- While attending a festival together, they both independently realized the impermanence and futility of sensual pleasures
- They made a pact to search for a path to liberation from suffering
- Initially, they joined the ascetic teacher Sañjaya Belatthaputta, who taught skepticism
- Though they quickly became leaders among Sañjaya's disciples, they found his teachings incomplete
- They separated to search for a true teacher, agreeing that whoever found the truth first would inform the other

## Conversion to Buddhism

### The Pivotal Encounter

Upatissa (Sariputta) encountered the monk Assaji, one of the Buddha's first five disciples:

- Impressed by Assaji's serene demeanor, Upatissa asked about his teacher and doctrine
- Assaji uttered the famous verse summarizing the Buddha's teaching:
  *"Of those things that arise from a cause,  
  The Tathagata has told the cause,  
  And also what their cessation is:  
  This is the doctrine of the Great Recluse."*
- This concise statement led to Sariputta's immediate breakthrough to the first stage of enlightenment

### Bringing the Friend

- True to his promise, Sariputta immediately sought out Kolita (Moggallana)
- Upon hearing the same verse, Moggallana also attained the first stage of enlightenment
- Together with their 250 followers, they went to meet the Buddha and request ordination
- The Buddha welcomed them with the words, "Come, monks, well taught is the Dhamma. Lead the holy life for the complete ending of suffering."

## Final Days and Parinibbana

### Sariputta's Passing

Sariputta's death came shortly before the Buddha's own parinibbana:

- He converted his mother, a staunch Brahmin, to Buddhism on his deathbed
- He passed away peacefully in the room where he was born
- His relics were brought back to the Buddha, who commented on the impermanence of all conditioned things

### Moggallana's Tragic End

Moggallana's death was violent and considered the result of past karma:

- He was murdered by bandits hired by jealous religious rivals
- Despite his powers, he did not evade this fate, understanding it as the fruition of past actions (in a previous life, he had killed his own parents)
- The Buddha explained that even psychic powers cannot overcome the ripening of certain karmic debts
