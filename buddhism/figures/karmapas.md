# The Karmapas

The Karmapas are the head lamas of the Karma Kagyu school, one of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. They represent the oldest continuous tulku lineage (reincarnating lamas) in Tibetan Buddhism, predating even the Dalai Lama lineage by over two centuries. The title "Karmapa" means "the one who performs the activities (karma) of the Buddha."

## Historical Origins

The Karma Kagyu lineage was established by the first Karmapa, Düsum Khyenpa (1110-1193), who was a principal disciple of Gampopa, himself a leading student of the great yogi Milarepa. Düsum Khyenpa was recognized as an accomplished master and, near the end of his life, left detailed instructions about his future rebirth. His reincarnation as Karma Pakshi (1204-1283) established what would become the first recognized tulku lineage in Tibet.

This system of identifying and enthroning reincarnations of deceased masters became one of the defining characteristics of Tibetan Buddhism and was later adopted by other schools, most notably the Gelug school with its Dalai Lama lineage.

## The Karmapa Lineage

Throughout Tibetan history, the Karmapas have been renowned for their spiritual accomplishments, scholarship, and activities benefiting sentient beings. Here are the seventeen Karmapas recognized in the traditional lineage:

1. **Düsum Khyenpa** (1110-1193) - Founded the Karma Kagyu lineage and established Tsurphu Monastery

## The 16th Karmapa: Global Ambassador

The 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, deserves special mention as the figure who brought the Karma Kagyu lineage to the Western world. Following the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950, he escaped to India in 1959, eventually establishing Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim as his main seat in exile.

In the 1970s, he made extensive tours of Europe and North America, founding numerous dharma centers and inspiring thousands of Westerners to study Tibetan Buddhism. The 16th Karmapa was known for his powerful presence, compassion, and his remarkable "Black Crown" ceremony, which was said to bestow liberation upon seeing it.

His ability to bridge Eastern and Western cultures helped establish Tibetan Buddhism as a significant spiritual tradition in the modern world. He passed away in 1981 in a hospital in Zion, Illinois, where his death was marked by extraordinary signs that impressed the medical staff.

## The Current Situation

Following the death of the 16th Karmapa, two different candidates were recognized as the 17th Karmapa by different lineage holders:

1. **Ogyen Trinley Dorje** - Recognized by Tai Situ Rinpoche and the 14th Dalai Lama in 1992. He escaped from Tibet to India in 2000 and has gained wider international recognition.

2. **Trinley Thaye Dorje** - Recognized by Shamar Rinpoche in 1994. He also has many followers and has established numerous centers worldwide.

This dual recognition has created a division within the Karma Kagyu school. However, both Karmapas have expressed respect for each other and met in 2018, issuing a joint statement expressing their wish to work together to heal the division in the lineage.

## Spiritual Authority and Responsibilities

The Karmapa is considered the embodiment of compassionate action of all the Buddhas and serves several important roles:

- **Spiritual Leader**: Guiding the Karma Kagyu school and preserving its distinct teachings
- **Teacher**: Transmitting essential Buddhist teachings, particularly Mahamudra meditation
- **Recognizer**: Identifying reincarnations (tulkus) of important Kagyu lamas
- **Administrator**: Overseeing monasteries, nunneries, and educational institutions
- **Cultural Preserver**: Maintaining Tibetan Buddhist arts, rituals, and traditions

A unique aspect of the Karmapa's identity is the Black Crown (Vajra Crown), said to have been given by celestial beings to the 5th Karmapa and visible only to those with pure perception. A physical representation of this crown is used in the famous "Black Crown Ceremony," where the Karmapa's donning of the crown is said to confer blessings and even liberation upon witnesses.

## Teachings and Practices

The Karmapas are the main holders of the Karma Kagyu lineage teachings, which emphasize:

1. **Mahamudra** - Direct realization of mind's nature, the ultimate reality
2. **Six Yogas of Naropa** - Advanced tantric practices including inner heat (tummo), illusory body, dream yoga, clear light, consciousness transference (phowa), and intermediate state (bardo)
3. **Devotional practices** - Particularly to Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion
4. **Guru Yoga** - Deep connection to the spiritual teacher as essential for realization
5. **Doha** - Spiritual songs of realization, following the tradition of Milarepa

Throughout history, various Karmapas have also been accomplished scholars, poets, artists, and meditation masters, each contributing unique teachings and emphases to the lineage.

## Cultural Impact

The Karmapas have had significant impact on Tibetan Buddhism and culture:

- **Monastic Institutions**: Establishing and maintaining major monasteries, including Tsurphu in Tibet and Rumtek in India
- **Arts**: Supporting religious art, ritual objects, and thangka painting
- **Literature**: Many Karmapas authored important texts on Buddhist philosophy and practice
- **Diplomacy**: Historically serving as mediators in political conflicts and advisors to rulers
- **Modern Buddhism**: Since the 16th Karmapa, helping adapt traditional teachings for contemporary society

Today, both recognized 17th Karmapas continue to teach internationally and have strong followings worldwide.
