# Marpa the Translator: Bridge Between India and Tibet

Marpa Lotsawa (1012-1097 CE), commonly known as Marpa the Translator (Tibetan: མར་པ་ལོ་ཙཱ་བ་, Wylie: mar pa lo tsā ba), was a pivotal figure in the transmission of Buddhism from India to Tibet. Born during Tibet's "later diffusion" period, Marpa undertook extraordinary journeys to India to study directly with great masters, most notably Naropa. His translations of Sanskrit texts, mastery of tantric practices, and role as Milarepa's teacher established him as one of the most important figures in Tibetan Buddhism and the founding father of the Kagyu lineage.
