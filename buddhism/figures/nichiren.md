# Nichiren (1222-1282)

Nichiren was a charismatic and controversial 13th-century Japanese Buddhist monk whose passionate devotion to the Lotus Sutra led him to establish one of Japan's most distinctive Buddhist schools. His uncompromising stance, prophetic warnings, and creation of a practice centered on the daimoku (chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) continue to inspire millions of followers worldwide today.

## Life and Background

### Early Years

Nichiren was born in 1222 in a small fishing village called Kominato in Awa Province (present-day Chiba Prefecture) on the Pacific coast of Japan. His birth name was Zennichi-maro, and he was the son of a fisherman, though some traditional biographies suggest his family had fallen from a higher status. This humble origin would later inform his concern for ordinary people's access to Buddhist practice.

From an early age, he showed remarkable intelligence and spiritual inclination. At age 11, he was sent to study at a nearby Tendai temple called Seicho-ji, where he was ordained as a novice monk and given the name Yakuo-maro.

### Years of Study and Religious Seeking

After his initial ordination, Nichiren embarked on an intensive period of study spanning approximately two decades:

- At age 16, he took full ordination as a monk
- He traveled to Kamakura, Kyoto, and major temple centers to study various Buddhist traditions
- He mastered the teachings of all major Japanese Buddhist schools of his time, including Tendai, Shingon, Pure Land, and Zen
- He became increasingly convinced that Japanese Buddhism had strayed from true Buddhist principles

During this period, Japan was experiencing severe natural disasters, social unrest, and threats of Mongol invasion. Nichiren came to believe these calamities were karmic consequences of Japan's embrace of "incorrect" Buddhist teachings.

### Proclamation of Faith in the Lotus Sutra

On April 28, 1253, at age 32, Nichiren returned to Seicho-ji temple and publicly declared his new faith. Ascending the lecture platform, he chanted "Nam-myoho-renge-kyo" (Devotion to the Lotus Sutra) for the first time and delivered a sermon criticizing all other Buddhist schools. He took the name Nichiren, meaning "Sun Lotus," symbolizing the illuminating truth of the Lotus Sutra.

This declaration, rather than being merely a personal spiritual awakening, was explicitly framed as a mission to correct Japanese Buddhism and save the nation from disaster. It immediately made him enemies, and he was forced to flee the temple after an attempt on his life.

### Persecution and Exile

Nichiren's career was marked by persistent persecution resulting from his uncompromising criticism of other Buddhist schools and the government's support of them:

- In 1260, after predicting disasters would befall Japan for its religious errors, he was exiled to Izu Peninsula
- In 1261, he was pardoned and returned to Kamakura
- In 1271, after renewed criticism of the government, he faced the "Tatsunokuchi Persecution" where he was nearly executed before a reported miraculous intervention
- Following this incident, he was exiled to Sado Island, a remote and harsh environment
- In 1274, he was pardoned from exile after the Mongols attempted to invade Japan, seemingly validating his prophecies

Throughout these persecutions, Nichiren maintained his convictions, believing his sufferings mirrored those of the Bodhisattva Sadaparibhuta described in the Lotus Sutra, who was persecuted for recognizing Buddha-nature in all beings.

### Retreat to Mount Minobu and Final Years

In 1274, after his pardon from Sado Island, Nichiren withdrew to Mount Minobu in the remote mountains of Kai Province (present-day Yamanashi Prefecture). There he established a temple and training center, where he wrote many of his major treatises and trained disciples.

During this period, he refined his teachings and focused on establishing a community that would carry on his lineage. He spent his final years at Minobu, though he eventually left due to illness and died at the home of a disciple in Ikegami (modern-day Tokyo) on October 13, 1282, at the age of 61.

Throughout his relatively short life, he produced an extensive body of writings, established a dedicated following of monks and lay believers, and created a distinctive form of Buddhism centered entirely on the Lotus Sutra.

## Key Teachings

### The Supremacy of the Lotus Sutra

The foundation of Nichiren's teaching is the absolute supremacy of the Lotus Sutra (Saddharmapundarika Sutra):

- He considered it the Buddha's highest, final, and complete teaching
- He believed it contained the perfect and direct path to Buddhahood
- He taught that all other sutras were provisional teachings leading to the Lotus Sutra
- He emphasized that the Lotus Sutra was uniquely appropriate for the Latter Day of the Law (mappō), the degenerate age he believed he was living in

This exclusive focus distinguished his approach from the more syncretic tendencies of other Japanese Buddhist schools.

### Daimoku: Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

Nichiren established a practice centered on chanting the daimoku, "Nam-myoho-renge-kyo," which means "Devotion to the Mystic Law of the Lotus Sutra":

- The chant serves as both the means and goal of religious practice
- It embodies the entirety of the Lotus Sutra's teachings in a form accessible to all
- It enables direct connection to the Buddha-nature within all beings
- It represents the universal law (Dharma) that permeates all existence

Nichiren taught that this simple practice contained the essence of all Buddhist practices and was specifically suited to the challenging conditions of the mappō age.

### The Gohonzon

As a focus for devotion and meditation, Nichiren created a mandala called the Gohonzon:

- A calligraphic representation with the daimoku written down the center
- Surrounded by the names of various Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and protective deities
- A physical representation of the enlightened reality described in the Lotus Sutra
- An object of devotion (honzon) for practitioners to focus upon during chanting

The Gohonzon is not considered an external deity but a representation of the practitioner's own Buddha-nature and the ultimate reality of life.

### Three Great Secret Laws

Nichiren articulated three essential elements of his practice:

1. **The Daimoku** (Nam-myoho-renge-kyo): The invocation embodying the essence of the Lotus Sutra
2. **The Gohonzon**: The mandala representing the enlightened life-state
3. **The Kaidan** (Ordination Platform): Originally conceived as a national sanctuary for the exclusive practice of Nichiren Buddhism, though never established during his lifetime

These three elements formed the core of his distinctive approach to Buddhist practice.

### Unity of Person and Law (Ninpō Ikka)

A key philosophical aspect of Nichiren's teaching was the inseparability of the individual and the Mystic Law:

- Each person inherently possesses Buddha-nature
- This Buddha-nature is activated through faith in and practice of the Lotus Sutra
- There is no distinction between the Buddha's enlightenment and the enlightenment available to ordinary people
- Religious practice is not about becoming something other than oneself but revealing one's true nature

This concept provided a theoretical foundation for the direct attainment of Buddhahood by ordinary people without elaborate practices or extensive study.

### Social and Political Dimensions

Unlike many Buddhist teachers who focused primarily on individual salvation, Nichiren emphasized the social implications of Buddhist practice:

- He believed correct Buddhist practice would lead to peace and prosperity for the nation
- He explicitly connected Japan's natural disasters and military threats to incorrect religious practice
- He advocated for the establishment of a state centered on the Lotus Sutra for the benefit of all citizens
- He viewed the spread of his teachings as essential not just for individual salvation but for social welfare

This socio-political dimension of Nichiren's thought would have significant implications for later forms of engaged Buddhism.

## Major Works

Nichiren was a prolific writer who composed hundreds of letters, treatises, and doctrinal works. His most significant writings include:

1. **Rissho Ankoku Ron** ("On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land"): His first major treatise, written in 1260 and presented to the ruling regent, warning that Japan faced disasters because of its reliance on "heretical" Buddhist teachings

2. **Kaimoku Sho** ("Opening of the Eyes"): Composed during his exile on Sado Island, explaining why he was willing to face persecution for his beliefs

3. **Kanjin no Honzon Sho** ("The Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind"): Establishing the theoretical basis for the Gohonzon

4. **Senji Sho** ("The Selection of the Time"): Explaining why the daimoku is the appropriate practice for the Latter Day of the Law

5. **Hoon Sho** ("On Repaying Debts of Gratitude"): Discussing the four debts of gratitude that all people should acknowledge and repay

6. **Gosho** ("Honorable Writings"): The collected letters he wrote to followers, providing guidance and encouragement, which now form a major part of the Nichiren Buddhist canon

These works combine doctrinal exposition, personal encouragement to followers, and polemics against rival Buddhist schools, reflecting Nichiren's role as both theologian and religious leader.

## Conflicts with Other Schools

A defining characteristic of Nichiren's approach was his explicit critique of other Buddhist schools:

### Critique of Pure Land Buddhism

- He rejected Amida Buddha as a provisional teaching superseded by the Lotus Sutra
- He criticized exclusive nembutsu practice as leading practitioners away from the true path
- He considered the popularity of Pure Land teachings a sign of decline in the Dharma

### Critique of Zen

- He rejected what he saw as Zen's disregard for sutra study and its claim of "special transmission outside the scriptures"
- He viewed meditation without the Lotus Sutra as incomplete practice
- He criticized Zen's popularity among the samurai class

### Critique of Shingon

- He rejected esoteric practices as unnecessary complications when the direct path of the Lotus Sutra was available
- He criticized the secrecy of Shingon initiations as contrary to the universal accessibility taught in the Lotus Sutra

### Critique of Traditional Tendai

- Though his own background was in Tendai Buddhism, he criticized contemporary Tendai practice for diluting the Lotus Sutra with esoteric elements
- He viewed Tendai's combinatory approach to practice (combining various sutras and practices) as a compromise of the Lotus Sutra's supremacy

These critiques earned him many enemies but reflected his conviction that incorrect teachings were actively harmful both to individuals and society.

## Development of Nichiren Buddhism After His Death

Following Nichiren's death, various interpretations of his teaching emerged, eventually leading to institutional divisions:

### Initial Disciples and Their Lineages

Nichiren designated six senior disciples to carry on his teachings:
- Nissho (1221-1323)
- Nichiro (1245-1320)
- Nikko (1246-1333)
- Niko (1253-1314)
- Nitcho (1252-1317)
- Nichiji (1250-?)

However, disagreements soon arose over the interpretation of Nichiren's teachings and the proper way to honor his legacy.

### Major Schisms

The most significant early division occurred between:

- **Nikko's lineage**: Taking a more exclusive stance that Nichiren was the true Buddha of the Latter Day and that his teachings must be followed exactly
- **Other disciples' lineages**: Adopting more moderate positions and sometimes accommodating other Buddhist practices

This initial split eventually developed into numerous subsects with varying interpretations of Nichiren's teachings.

### Modern Nichiren Schools

Today, multiple organizations trace their lineage to Nichiren:

- **Nichiren Shu**: A more traditional denomination that views Nichiren as an important teacher but still reveres Shakyamuni Buddha
- **Nichiren Shoshu**: A more exclusive sect that regards Nichiren himself as the true Buddha of the Latter Day
- **Rissho Kosei-kai**: A modernized interpretation focusing on lay practice and interfaith dialogue
- **Soka Gakkai International**: A lay organization originally affiliated with Nichiren Shoshu that has become the largest Nichiren-based movement globally

Each of these groups interprets Nichiren's legacy somewhat differently while maintaining devotion to the Lotus Sutra and the practice of chanting daimoku.

## Legacy and Influence

### Religious Significance

Nichiren's impact on Japanese Buddhism has been profound:

- He established a distinctively Japanese form of Buddhism not directly imported from China
- He simplified practice to make it accessible to ordinary people
- He created a tradition that has survived nearly 800 years
- He demonstrated how the abstract teachings of Mahayana Buddhism could be concretized in a specific practice

### Cultural Influence

Beyond religious doctrine, Nichiren's influence extends to Japanese culture:

- His emphasis on this-worldly benefits (genze riyaku) aligned with Japanese religious sensibilities
- His strong nationalist elements influenced later Japanese religious-political movements
- His writing style, combining classical Chinese with Japanese readings, influenced religious literature
- The visual culture surrounding Gohonzon and other Nichiren Buddhist imagery shaped Japanese religious art

### Modern Relevance

Several aspects of Nichiren's teachings have found particular resonance in the modern world:

- The accessibility of daimoku practice in busy contemporary life
- The emphasis on inner transformation as the basis for social change
- The integration of religious practice with everyday concerns
- The assertion that all people inherently possess Buddha-nature regardless of status or education

Soka Gakkai International, based on Nichiren's teachings, has become one of the largest and most influential lay Buddhist movements globally, with millions of members across 192 countries and territories.

## Critical Perspectives

### Historical Analysis

Modern scholarship has examined various aspects of Nichiren's life and teachings:

- The extent to which his thought represents innovation versus traditional Tendai doctrine
- The political and social context that shaped his confrontational approach
- The development of hagiographical elements in accounts of his life after his death
- The relationship between his teachings and the volatile climate of Kamakura-period Japan

### Religious Critiques

From a comparative religious perspective, certain elements of Nichiren's approach have been questioned:

- His exclusivist stance in contrast to the more inclusive tendencies in much of Mahayana Buddhism
- His confrontational methods compared to Buddhist ideals of compassion and non-violence
- The tension between his nationalistic elements and Buddhism's universal message
- The simplification of practice compared to traditional meditative approaches

### Sectarian Interpretations

Different Nichiren sects interpret his legacy in varying ways:

- The status of Nichiren himself (as Buddha, bodhisattva, or enlightened teacher)
- The appropriate relationship with other Buddhist traditions and religions
- The degree to which his 13th-century socio-political views should inform modern practice
- The balance between faith and study in understanding his teachings

Despite these divergent interpretations, all Nichiren traditions maintain the centrality of the Lotus Sutra and the practice of daimoku.
