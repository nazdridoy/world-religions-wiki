# Spread of Buddhism to East Asia

Buddhism's journey to East Asia represents one of history's most significant cultural transmissions, profoundly transforming the religious, philosophical, and artistic landscapes of China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. As Buddhism moved eastward from India through Central Asia and across maritime routes, it adapted to new cultural contexts while maintaining its core teachings, resulting in distinctive East Asian Buddhist traditions that continue to thrive today.
