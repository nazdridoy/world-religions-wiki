# Emperor Ashoka

Emperor Ashoka (304-232 BCE, also spelled Aśoka) was the third ruler of the Mauryan Empire and one of the most significant figures in the spread of Buddhism. His conversion to Buddhism after witnessing the devastation of his own military conquests transformed him from a ruthless conqueror into a benevolent ruler whose policies and edicts helped spread Buddhist principles throughout the Indian subcontinent and beyond.

## Early Life and Rise to Power

### Royal Origins
- Born as Vardhamāna Ashoka around 304 BCE in Pataliputra (modern-day Patna)
- Son of Emperor Bindusara and grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Mauryan Empire
- One of many princes (tradition suggests he had 99 half-brothers)
- Not initially the designated heir to the throne

### Path to the Throne
- Served as a viceroy in Ujjain and Taxila during his father's reign
- Demonstrated military and administrative acumen in suppressing revolts
- After Bindusara's death around 272 BCE, a succession struggle ensued
- According to Buddhist chronicles, Ashoka eliminated rival claimants (including many of his brothers) to secure the throne
- Formally crowned emperor around 268 BCE

## The Kalinga War and Conversion

### The Kalinga Campaign
- Around 260 BCE, Ashoka launched a military campaign against the independent state of Kalinga (modern-day Odisha)
- The war was extraordinarily brutal, even by ancient standards
- According to Ashoka's own edicts, over 100,000 people were killed in battle
- Another 150,000 were deported, and many more died from starvation and disease

### Transformation
- The immense suffering caused by the war triggered a profound moral crisis for Ashoka
- In his 13th Major Rock Edict, he expressed deep remorse for the suffering he caused
- Shortly after the war, Ashoka converted to Buddhism
- While the exact circumstances are unclear, tradition holds that he was influenced by a Buddhist monk named Nigrodha

### Adoption of Buddhism
- Embraced the Buddha's teachings on non-violence (ahimsa) and righteous rule (dhamma)
- Did not make Buddhism the state religion but personally followed and promoted its principles
- Continued to respect and support other religious traditions within his empire
- Referred to himself as "Beloved of the Gods" (Devanampiya) in his edicts
