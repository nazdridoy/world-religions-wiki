# The Shramana Movement

The Shramana movement (Sanskrit: śramaṇa, Pali: samaṇa) was a broad non-Vedic ascetic tradition in ancient India that gave rise to several major religious and philosophical schools, including Buddhism and Jainism. Emerging as a reaction to Brahmanical orthodoxy around the 7th-6th centuries BCE, the Shramana tradition profoundly influenced the religious and philosophical landscape of South Asia.

## Historical Context

### Vedic Background
- The dominant religious paradigm in ancient India was the Brahmanical tradition based on Vedic sacrifices and rituals
- Society was organized according to the varna system (four social classes)
- Brahmins (priests) held the highest religious authority and performed essential rituals
- Religious practice centered on elaborate sacrificial ceremonies and adherence to ritual purity

### Period of Religious Ferment
- The 7th-5th centuries BCE marked a period of significant social and intellectual change in northern India
- Urbanization and the rise of new political structures challenged traditional social hierarchies
- Expansion of trade created cosmopolitan centers where new ideas circulated
- Growing dissatisfaction with ritualistic religion led to questioning of Brahmanical authority
- The Upanishads emerged within the Vedic tradition as a more philosophical approach

## Characteristics of the Shramana Tradition

### Etymology and Identity
- "Shramana" derives from the Sanskrit root "śram" meaning "to exert effort" or "to perform austerities"
- Shramanas were wandering ascetics who had renounced worldly life
- They lived by begging and followed strict ethical codes
- Most rejected Vedic authority and the caste system
- They formed distinct communities with their own rules and practices

### Core Philosophical Features
- Rejection of Vedic sacrifice and ritual as the path to liberation
- Emphasis on individual effort and direct experience rather than textual authority
- Focus on asceticism and self-discipline as spiritual practices
- Belief in karma and rebirth (in most but not all Shramana schools)
- Skepticism toward the existence or relevance of gods
- Development of systematic philosophical and ethical frameworks

### Ascetic Practices
- Celibacy and sexual abstinence
- Fasting and dietary restrictions
- Homelessness and wandering (except during the monsoon season)
- Silence vows and meditation
- In some cases, extreme austerities like:
  - Standing in one position for extended periods
  - Exposure to extreme temperatures
  - Self-mortification practices
  - Complete or partial nudity
