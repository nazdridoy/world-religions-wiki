# History of Buddhism

Buddhism emerged in northeastern India around the 5th century BCE, founded by Siddhartha Gautama (later known as the Buddha). From these origins, it spread throughout Asia, evolving into diverse traditions and becoming one of the world's major religions.

## Historical Significance

The historical development of Buddhism is characterized by its remarkable adaptability. As it spread from India to different parts of Asia, Buddhism incorporated local customs and beliefs while maintaining its core principles. This adaptability contributed to Buddhism's widespread appeal and longevity as a major world religion.

The spread of Buddhism also facilitated cultural exchange throughout Asia, leading to developments in art, architecture, literature, and philosophy in the regions it reached.
