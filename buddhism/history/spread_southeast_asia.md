# The Spread of Buddhism to Southeast Asia

Buddhism's expansion into Southeast Asia represents one of the most successful and enduring religious transmissions in world history. From its origins in India, Buddhism spread across the diverse lands and cultures of Southeast Asia, adapting to local conditions while maintaining its core teachings. Today, Theravada Buddhism remains the dominant religion in mainland Southeast Asia, profoundly shaping the cultures, arts, and societies of the region.
