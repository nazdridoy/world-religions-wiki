# Buddhist Councils

Buddhist Councils (Sangiti) were important gatherings of Buddhist monks held to preserve, codify, and clarify the Buddha's teachings after his death. These councils played a crucial role in the preservation and development of Buddhist doctrine and monastic discipline.

## First Buddhist Council (c. 483 BCE)

The First Buddhist Council was held shortly after the Buddha's parinirvana (death) at Rajagaha (modern Rajgir) under the patronage of King Ajatasattu.

### Purpose and Participants
- **Convener**: Mahakassapa, a senior disciple of the Buddha
- **Key participants**: Included Ananda (the Buddha's personal attendant) and Upali
- **Number of monks**: Traditionally said to be 500 arhats (fully enlightened beings)

### Achievements
- **Compilation of the Vinaya**: Upali recited the monastic rules (Vinaya)
- **Compilation of the Suttas**: Ananda recited the Buddha's discourses (Suttas)
- **Purpose**: To ensure the accurate preservation of the Buddha's teachings
- **Method**: Oral recitation and memorization, as writing was not commonly used for religious texts

### Historical Significance
This council established the initial collection of the Buddha's teachings that would later develop into the Pali Canon. It also addressed concerns about maintaining doctrinal purity and monastic discipline after the Buddha's passing.

## Second Buddhist Council (c. 383 BCE)

The Second Council was held approximately 100 years after the Buddha's death at Vesali (modern Vaishali).

### Purpose and Context
- **Trigger**: Dispute over ten points of monastic discipline by monks from Vajji region
- **Issue**: Whether certain relaxations of monastic rules were permissible
- **Venue**: Valikarama monastery at Vesali

### The Ten Points of Controversy
These included practices such as:
1. Storing salt in a horn
2. Eating after midday
3. Traveling to another village and eating again
4. Holding separate ceremonies within the same monastery boundary
5. Seeking approval for an action after it was done
6. Citing habitual practice as authority
7. Drinking non-fermented milk after meals
8. Consuming mild alcoholic drinks
9. Using luxurious mats
10. Accepting gold and silver (money)

### Outcome and Impact
- The council ruled against these practices, reaffirming the stricter interpretation of Vinaya
- Despite this ruling, the more liberal faction did not accept the decision
- This disagreement may have contributed to the first major schism in Buddhism, though scholars debate the exact connection

## Third Buddhist Council (c. 250 BCE)

The Third Council was convened during the reign of Emperor Ashoka at Pataliputra (modern Patna).

### Context and Purpose
- **Patron**: Emperor Ashoka, who had converted to Buddhism
- **Convener**: Elder Moggaliputta Tissa
- **Primary issue**: Proliferation of heresies and corruption within the Sangha
- **Additional purpose**: Expansion of Buddhism through missions

### Proceedings and Achievements
- Expulsion of false monks and heretics from the Sangha
- Compilation of the Abhidhamma Pitaka (philosophical analyses)
- Composition of the Kathavatthu (Points of Controversy), refuting incorrect interpretations
- Formalization of the Theravada position

### Missions Dispatched
Following the council, Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to various regions:
- Mahinda (Ashoka's son) to Sri Lanka
- Missions to Kashmir, Gandhara, and the Himalayas
- Missions to the western regions (potentially as far as Greece)
- Missions to Southeast Asian regions

## Fourth Buddhist Council

There are two different events referred to as the Fourth Buddhist Council, one in the Theravada tradition and one in the Mahayana tradition:

### Theravada Fourth Council (29-17 BCE)
- **Location**: Aloka Cave in Sri Lanka (Aluvihara)
- **Patron**: King Vattagamani Abhaya
- **Significance**: First writing down of the Pali Canon on palm leaves
- **Motivation**: Famine and political instability threatened the oral tradition

### Mahayana Fourth Council (c. 100 CE)
- **Location**: Kashmir, under King Kanishka of the Kushan Empire
- **Chairman**: Vasumitra, with Ashvaghosha as deputy
- **Achievements**: Compilation of commentaries (vibhasha) on the Abhidharma
- **Significance**: Important for the development of Sarvastivada Abhidharma

## Later Buddhist Councils

### Fifth Buddhist Council (1871 CE)
- Held in Mandalay, Burma (Myanmar)
- Sponsored by King Mindon Min
- Resulted in the carving of the entire Pali Canon on 729 marble slabs
- Focused on preserving the authentic teachings against colonial influences

### Sixth Buddhist Council (1954-1956 CE)
- Held in Rangoon (Yangon), Burma
- Coincided with the 2,500th anniversary of the Buddha's parinirvana
- Involved monks from several Theravada countries
- Resulted in a new edition of the Pali Canon

## Historical Assessment

### Historical Reliability
Scholars debate the historical accuracy of accounts of the early councils:
- The First Council likely occurred in some form, though details may be embellished
- Archaeological and textual evidence confirms later councils, especially from Ashoka's time onward
- Records become more historically reliable with later councils

### Significance for Buddhist Traditions
- **Preservation**: The councils helped preserve the Buddha's teachings in an era before widespread literacy
- **Sectarian development**: Councils often marked points of development in sectarian differences
- **Geographic spread**: Later councils facilitated the spread of Buddhism beyond India
- **Canon formation**: The councils played a crucial role in the formation and authentication of Buddhist scriptures
