# Early Buddhist Schools

The early Buddhist schools (Nikāya Buddhism) were the various sects that developed within Buddhism during the first few centuries after the Buddha's death. These schools emerged as the result of geographic dispersion, linguistic differences, doctrinal disagreements, and monastic disciplinary variations. The study of these early schools provides crucial insight into the development of Buddhist thought and practice.

## Overview and Historical Background

### Timeline of Development
- **5th century BCE**: Death of the Buddha and First Buddhist Council
- **4th century BCE**: Second Buddhist Council and the first major schism
- **3rd century BCE**: During Ashoka's reign, more schools begin to form
- **2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE**: Proliferation of schools across India
- **5th century CE onward**: Decline of many schools in India as Mahayana expands

### Sources of Information
Information about early Buddhist schools comes from several types of sources:
- **Archaeological evidence**: Inscriptions, monastery ruins
- **Buddhist texts**: Each school's own canonical texts and commentaries
- **Doxographies**: Texts describing various schools and their doctrines, such as:
  - *Kathāvatthu* (Points of Controversy)
  - *Samayabhedoparacanacakra* (Vasumitra's treatise)
  - *Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra* (Great Commentary)
- **Chinese pilgrims' accounts**: Faxian, Xuanzang, and Yijing described schools existing during their visits to India

## The First Major Schism

### Sthaviras and Mahasanghikas

The first major division in the Buddhist community occurred after the Second Buddhist Council, traditionally dated around 383 BCE:

- **Sthaviras** ("Elders")
  - Conservative faction
  - Advocated strict adherence to Vinaya rules
  - Claimed to represent the original teachings of the Buddha
  - Would later split into numerous sub-schools including the ancestors of Theravada

- **Mahasanghikas** ("Great Assembly")
  - More progressive faction
  - Advocated some relaxation of monastic rules
  - Developed new perspectives on the nature of the Buddha
  - Often seen as precursors to Mahayana ideas

### The Ten Points of Controversy
The schism allegedly originated from a dispute over ten points of monastic discipline:
1. Storing salt in a horn
2. Eating after midday
3. Traveling to another village for alms and eating again
4. Holding ceremonies separately within the same boundary
5. Seeking approval for an action after it was done
6. Following habitual practice as authority
7. Drinking milk whey after meals
8. Consuming mild alcoholic drinks
9. Using luxurious mats
10. Accepting gold and silver (money)

## Major Early Schools

By the 3rd century CE, traditional accounts mention 18 or 20 schools, though scholars have identified over 30 named schools. The most important include:

### Theravada (Sthaviravada)
- The only early school that survives to the present day
- Preserved texts in Pali language
- Emphasized the human, historical Buddha
- Focused on liberation through individual effort
- Strong in Sri Lanka and later Southeast Asia

### Sarvastivada
- One of the most influential early schools
- Dominant in North India and Central Asia
- Name means "the theory that all exists," referring to their view that phenomena exist in past, present, and future
- Developed extensive Abhidharma literature
- Strong scholastic tradition focusing on detailed analysis of dharmas (phenomena)

### Dharmaguptaka
- Influential in Gandhara, Central Asia, and later East Asia
- Had their own version of Vinaya that became standard in China
- Emphasized devotion to the Buddha and stupas
- Believed in additional merit from offerings to the Buddha versus the sangha

### Pudgalavada (Personalist School)
- Name derives from their distinctive doctrine of pudgala (person)
- Attempted to explain continuity between lives without contradicting non-self (anatta)
- Often criticized by other schools for undermining fundamental Buddhist teachings
- Divided into several sub-schools including Vatsiputriya and Sammitiya
- Very popular according to historical accounts but texts are mostly lost

### Mahisasaka
- Geographically located in western India
- Doctrinally positioned between Theravada and Sarvastivada
- Influenced the development of Chinese Buddhism

### Vibhajyavada (Distinctionist School)
- Sometimes considered the parent school of Theravada
- Emphasized careful analysis and distinction between phenomena
- Rejected the Sarvastivadin view that dharmas exist in all three times

## Key Doctrinal Differences

The early schools differed on several key philosophical and doctrinal points:

### Nature of the Buddha
- **Lokottaravada** (a Mahasanghika sub-school): Believed the historical Buddha was just a manifestation, while the true Buddha is transcendental
- **Sarvastivada and Theravada**: Generally maintained a more human view of the Buddha

### Theory of Time and Existence
- **Sarvastivada**: Dharmas (phenomena) exist in all three times (past, present, future)
- **Vibhajyavada and Theravada**: Only present dharmas truly exist; past dharmas have ceased and future dharmas have not yet arisen

### The Person (Pudgala)
- **Pudgalavada**: Proposed a "person" that is neither identical to nor different from the aggregates
- **Most other schools**: Rejected any concept of person beyond the five aggregates

### Momentariness
- **Sarvastivada**: All dharmas last for a single moment before being replaced
- **Other schools**: Varied views on the duration of phenomena

### Path of Practice
- **Theravada**: Emphasized the arhat ideal and individual liberation
- **Mahasanghika sub-schools**: Began developing bodhisattva concepts that influenced Mahayana

### Abhidharma Classification
Different schools categorized and analyzed phenomena in distinct ways:
- **Theravada**: Listed 82 dhammas (phenomena) in their Abhidhamma
- **Sarvastivada**: Identified 75 dharmas arranged in five categories
- Other schools had different classification systems

## Textual Traditions

Each school developed its own canonical texts, though many shared common material:

### Tripitaka Variations
All schools organized their texts into three "baskets" (Tripitaka):
1. **Vinaya Pitaka**: Monastic rules and origin stories
2. **Sutra Pitaka**: Discourses attributed to the Buddha
3. **Abhidharma Pitaka**: Philosophical and psychological analysis

However, the content and organization varied:
- Different versions of the same texts
- Variant readings and emphasis
- Additional texts considered canonical by some schools but not others
- Different languages (Pali, Sanskrit, Prakrit dialects, and eventually Chinese and Tibetan translations)

### Surviving Canons
- **Theravada Canon**: Complete Pali Canon surviving in Sri Lanka
- **Sarvastivada Abhidharma**: Preserved in Chinese translation
- **Dharmaguptaka Vinaya**: Became standard in East Asia
- **Mulasarvastivada Vinaya**: Preserved in Tibetan translation
- Fragments of other schools' texts discovered in archaeological finds (Gandhara scrolls, etc.)

## Geographic Distribution

Different schools dominated different regions of the Buddhist world:

### Northern Transmission
- **Northwest India and Central Asia**: Sarvastivada, Dharmaguptaka
- **Kashmir**: Sarvastivada center of learning
- **Gandhara**: Multiple schools including Dharmaguptaka and Sarvastivada

### Southern Transmission
- **Sri Lanka**: Theravada became dominant
- **Southern India**: Diverse schools including Mahisasaka, Caitika

### Eastern Regions

## Legacy and Historical Significance

### Contribution to Buddhist Thought
- Development of systematic Abhidharma philosophical systems

### Decline in India
By the 7th century CE, many early schools had declined in India due to:
- Rise of Mahayana Buddhism
- Competition from rejuvenated Hinduism
- Later, Muslim invasions and the decline of Indian Buddhism in general

### Modern Scholarly Significance
- Comparative study of different schools' texts helps identify the earliest layers of Buddhist teaching
- Understanding sectarian developments provides insight into Buddhist doctrinal evolution
