# Buddhism in Central Asia

Buddhism's journey through Central Asia represents a crucial chapter in the religion's spread from India to East Asia. For nearly a millennium, the vast steppes, deserts, and mountain ranges of Central Asia served as both conduit and crucible for Buddhist ideas, art, and practices. This transmission was facilitated by the famous Silk Road trading networks and resulted in distinctive Central Asian Buddhist cultures that blended Indian, Persian, Hellenistic, and local influences.
