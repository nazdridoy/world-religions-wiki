# Tibetan Buddhism

Tibetan Buddhism represents one of Buddhism's most distinctive and comprehensive traditions, combining elements of Indian Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism with indigenous Tibetan beliefs and practices. Developing in the unique geographic and cultural isolation of the Tibetan plateau, it evolved into a rich religious tradition that has profoundly shaped Tibetan culture and spread globally in recent decades.
