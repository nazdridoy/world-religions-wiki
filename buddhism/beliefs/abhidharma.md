# Abhidharma: The Systematic Analysis of Buddhist Philosophy

Abhidharma (Sanskrit) or Abhidhamma (Pali) represents Buddhism's systematic and analytical approach to understanding the nature of mind, matter, and reality. Meaning "higher" or "special teaching," Abhidharma constitutes the third division of the Buddhist canon, developing a comprehensive philosophical psychology that analyzes consciousness, mental factors, material phenomena, and their interrelations.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Canonization

The origins of Abhidharma lie in the early Buddhist community's efforts to systematize the Buddha's teachings:

- **Early developments**: Initially, the term "abhidharma" referred to discussions and elaborations of sutras
- **Formative period**: 3rd-1st centuries BCE, when distinct Abhidharma texts began to take shape
- **Canonization**: By the 3rd century BCE, recognized as a separate "basket" (pitaka) of the Buddhist canon

The traditional account attributes the inception of Abhidharma to the Buddha himself, who supposedly taught it to devas (celestial beings) and later to his disciple Sariputra. Scholars, however, generally consider Abhidharma to be a post-Buddha development of the early Buddhist community.

### Schools and Texts

Multiple early Buddhist schools developed their own Abhidharma systems. Two complete collections survive:

1. **Theravada Abhidhamma**: Preserved in Pali, consists of seven texts:
   - Dhammasangani (Enumeration of Factors)
   - Vibhanga (Analysis)
   - Dhatukatha (Discussion of Elements)
   - Puggalapannatti (Designation of Persons)
   - Kathavatthu (Points of Controversy)
   - Yamaka (Pairs)
   - Patthana (Conditional Relations)

2. **Sarvastivada Abhidharma**: Preserved in Chinese translation, includes:
   - Sangitiparyaya (Discourse on the Collective Recitation)
   - Dharmaskandha (Aggregation of Dharmas)
   - Prajnaptisastra (Treatise on Designations)
   - Dhatukaya (Collection on Elements)
   - Vijnanakaya (Collection on Consciousness)
   - Prakaranapada (Exposition)
   - Jnanaprasthana (Foundations of Knowledge)

Later commentarial traditions produced seminal works that systematized Abhidharma teachings:
- **Visuddhimagga**: Buddhaghosa's 5th-century CE masterpiece in the Theravada tradition
- **Abhidharmakosa**: Vasubandhu's 4th/5th-century CE comprehensive exposition of Sarvastivada Abhidharma

## Core Concepts and Methods

### Analytical Approach

Abhidharma's distinguishing characteristic is its rigorous analytical methodology:

1. **Reductionism**: Breaking down conventional reality into ultimate constituents (dharmas)
2. **Classification**: Organizing phenomena into categories and relationships
3. **Definition**: Precisely defining each element of experience
4. **Causal analysis**: Explaining how elements arise, persist, and cease

This approach aims to eliminate conceptual confusion and provide practitioners with a precise understanding of the components of experience, supporting insight meditation.

### Dharma Theory

Central to Abhidharma is the theory of dharmas (dhammas in Pali)â€”the fundamental, irreducible units of physical and mental reality:

- **Definition**: Dharmas are momentary events or processes that constitute the flow of experience
- **Number**: Different schools enumerate different numbers of dharmas (Theravada: 82, Sarvastivada: 75)
- **Categories**: Typically classified as:
  - Mental (citta) - consciousness
  - Mental factors (cetasikas) - qualities of consciousness
  - Material (rupa) - physical phenomena
  - Unconditioned (asankhata) - nirvana

Dharmas are characterized by three marks:
1. Impermanence (anicca)
2. Suffering/unsatisfactoriness (dukkha)
3. Non-self (anatta)

### Analysis of Consciousness

Abhidharma provides an intricate map of consciousness and its accompanying mental factors:

- **Consciousness types**: Classified by sense-door (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind)
- **Wholesome vs. unwholesome**: States distinguished by their ethical quality
- **Mental factors**: Variables that accompany consciousness, determining its ethical and functional qualities
- **Thought-moments**: Consciousness analyzed as a rapid succession of discrete momentary events

### Causality and Conditionality

Abhidharma elaborates on how phenomena relate to and condition each other:

- **Dependent origination**: The 12 links explaining the cycle of suffering
- **Conditional relations**: The Patthana (in Theravada) identifies 24 modes of conditionality
- **Momentariness**: The theory that all phenomena arise and pass away in rapid succession

This detailed causal analysis supports the Buddhist principle that all conditioned phenomena are interdependent and nothing has independent existence.

## Abhidharma Across Traditions

### Theravada Abhidhamma

In Theravada Buddhism, Abhidhamma is revered as the most profound expression of the Buddha's wisdom:

- **Study approach**: Highly systematized, often using matrices (matika) to organize concepts
- **Key concepts**: Emphasis on mind-moments, specific mental factors, and process of perception
- **Practice relation**: Close connection to insight meditation (vipassana)
- **Modern relevance**: Still actively studied in monasteries in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Thailand

The Abhidhammatthasangaha, a medieval compendium by Anuruddha, remains the standard textbook for Abhidhamma studies in the Theravada world.

### Sarvastivada Abhidharma

The Sarvastivada school, influential in ancient India, developed a distinctive Abhidharma system:

- **Distinctive view**: "Sarvastivada" means "the theory that everything exists," referring to their view that dharmas exist in all three times (past, present, future)
- **Atomistic theory**: Developed a sophisticated theory of atomic matter
- **Causal efficiency**: Emphasized the causal efficacy of dharmas
- **Influence**: Though the school no longer exists, its Abhidharma influenced later Mahayana developments

### Yogacara Developments

The Yogacara school, a Mahayana tradition, built upon Abhidharma foundations while transforming key concepts:

- **Eight consciousnesses**: Expanded the Abhidharma model to include alaya-vijnana (store consciousness)
- **Three natures**: Reformulated the understanding of reality as imagined nature, dependent nature, and perfected nature
- **Mind-only**: Emphasized that what appears as external reality is projection of consciousness
- **Seed theory**: Developed the concept of bijas (seeds) to explain karmic causality

### Madhyamaka Critique

The Madhyamaka school, founded by Nagarjuna, critiqued Abhidharma's realist tendencies:

- **Emptiness of dharmas**: Argued that even the ultimate constituents identified by Abhidharma lack inherent existence
- **Two truths**: Distinguished conventional truth (including Abhidharma categories) from ultimate truth (emptiness)
- **Middle way**: Sought a position between absolute existence and nihilism

This critique did not reject Abhidharma wholesale but reinterpreted it as provisional rather than ultimate truth.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Relevance to Buddhist Practice

Abhidharma remains integral to Buddhist practice in several ways:

- **Meditation map**: Provides practitioners with a detailed map of mind states encountered in meditation
- **Ethical guidance**: Offers precise analysis of wholesome and unwholesome mental factors
- **Doctrinal clarity**: Helps resolve ambiguities in the Buddha's teachings
- **Contemplative framework**: Supports the analytical meditation practices that lead to insight

In traditions like Burmese Theravada, Abhidhamma study directly informs meditation instruction.

### Academic and Scientific Interest

Contemporary scholars and scientists find value in Abhidharma's sophisticated approach:

- **Buddhist Studies**: Provides a systematic framework for understanding Buddhist philosophy
- **Comparative Philosophy**: Offers rich material for comparison with Western phenomenology and philosophy of mind
- **Cognitive Science**: Presents a detailed introspective account of mental processes that complements scientific approaches
- **Clinical Psychology**: Offers categories that can inform psychological understanding and therapeutic approaches

Researchers like Francisco Varela and the Mind and Life Institute have explored parallels between Abhidharma and modern cognitive science.

### Challenges and Adaptations

Modern approaches to Abhidharma face several challenges:

- **Complexity**: The system's intricacy can be intimidating for newcomers
- **Cultural translation**: Adapting ancient Indian psychology to modern contexts
- **Empirical verification**: Determining which aspects can be verified through experience
- **Integration with science**: Reconciling traditional Abhidharma with scientific findings

Contemporary teachers often present Abhidharma selectively, emphasizing aspects most relevant to meditation practice and psychological understanding.

## Philosophical Significance

### Phenomenological Approach

Abhidharma represents one of history's earliest and most sophisticated phenomenological analyses:

- **First-person methodology**: Based on careful observation of subjective experience
- **Non-substantial view**: Analyzing experience without positing a substantial self
- **Process philosophy**: Viewing reality as dynamic process rather than static substances
- **Experiential verification**: Emphasizing the importance of direct verification through meditation

These characteristics prefigure aspects of Western phenomenology by over two millennia.

### Philosophical Problems Addressed

Abhidharma addresses numerous philosophical questions:

- **Mind-body problem**: Through analysis of mental and physical phenomena and their interaction
- **Personal identity**: Through the theory of momentary existence and conditioned arising
- **Problem of causality**: Through detailed analysis of conditional relations
- **Metaphysics of time**: Particularly in debates between Sarvastivada and other schools
- **Ethics**: Through analysis of wholesome and unwholesome mental states
