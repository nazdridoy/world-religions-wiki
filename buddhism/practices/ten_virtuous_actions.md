# Ten Virtuous Actions

The Ten Virtuous Actions (Sanskrit: *daśa-kuśala-karmapatha*; Tibetan: *dge ba bcu*) represent a comprehensive ethical framework in Buddhism that addresses conduct of body, speech, and mind. This system expands on the Five Precepts by including mental actions and providing a more detailed analysis of ethical behavior. The Ten Virtuous Actions are particularly emphasized in Mahayana Buddhism but are recognized across Buddhist traditions.

## Structure and Categories

The Ten Virtuous Actions are organized by the three doors of action: body, speech, and mind. They are traditionally presented in terms of abstaining from non-virtuous actions:

### Three Physical Virtues (Body)

1. **Abstaining from Killing** (*prāṇātipāta-virati*)  
   Respecting life and not deliberately causing harm to sentient beings.

2. **Abstaining from Stealing** (*adattādāna-virati*)  
   Not taking what is not freely given and respecting others' property.

3. **Abstaining from Sexual Misconduct** (*kāmesu-micchācāra-virati*)  
   Maintaining respectful, non-exploitative relationships and honoring commitments.

### Four Verbal Virtues (Speech)

4. **Abstaining from Lying** (*mṛṣāvāda-virati*)  
   Speaking truthfully and honestly in all situations.

5. **Abstaining from Divisive Speech** (*piśuna-virati*)  
   Not causing division through malicious speech or gossip that turns people against each other.

6. **Abstaining from Harsh Speech** (*pāruṣya-virati*)  
   Avoiding abusive, angry, or hurtful speech and using words that are kind and beneficial.

7. **Abstaining from Idle Chatter** (*saṃbhinnapralāpa-virati*)  
   Avoiding meaningless, excessive talk and speaking purposefully and appropriately.

### Three Mental Virtues (Mind)

8. **Abstaining from Covetousness** (*abhidhyā-virati*)  
   Not desiring to possess what belongs to others; contentment with what one has.

9. **Abstaining from Ill Will** (*vyāpāda-virati*)  
   Cultivating a mind free from hatred, anger, and wishes to harm others.

10. **Abstaining from Wrong Views** (*mithyādṛṣṭi-virati*)  
    Abandoning distorted understanding of reality, particularly regarding cause and effect.
