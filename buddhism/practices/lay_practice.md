# Buddhist Lay Practice

While monastics have traditionally been considered the primary practitioners of Buddhism, laypeople (non-ordained Buddhists) have always formed the majority of the Buddhist community. Lay practice integrates Buddhist principles and practices into daily life within the context of family, work, and social responsibilities. As Buddhism has spread globally, lay practice has gained increasing recognition as a valid and complete path, with distinctive approaches developing across different Buddhist traditions.
