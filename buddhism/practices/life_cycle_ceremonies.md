# Life Cycle Ceremonies in Buddhism

Buddhist ceremonies mark important transitions throughout the human life span, providing meaningful rituals that connect individual lives to Buddhist teachings and community traditions. While the Buddha did not explicitly establish many life cycle ceremonies, diverse rituals evolved as Buddhism adapted to different cultures, incorporating local customs while infusing them with Buddhist principles.
