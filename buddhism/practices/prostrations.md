# Buddhist Prostration Practices

Prostrations—physical acts of bowing or lowering the body in reverence—represent one of Buddhism's most direct and embodied devotional practices. Across Buddhist traditions, these physical gestures serve as powerful expressions of respect, humility, and spiritual aspiration. From simple head bows to full-body prostrations, these practices engage the practitioner's entire being in acts of veneration and ego-transcendence.
