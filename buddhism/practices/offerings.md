# Buddhist Offering Practices

The practice of making offerings (Pali: *pūjā*; Sanskrit: *pūjanā*) occupies a central place in Buddhist devotional life across all traditions. From simple personal gestures to elaborate temple ceremonies, offerings represent a tangible expression of respect, gratitude, and spiritual aspiration. While specific forms vary widely by tradition and region, the underlying principle remains consistent: offerings cultivate generosity, mindfulness, and non-attachment while honoring the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha).
