# Mahayana Practices

Mahayana Buddhism ("Great Vehicle") encompasses a diverse range of Buddhist traditions that share certain core elements: the bodhisattva ideal, emphasis on universal compassion, a more extensive scriptural basis than earlier schools, and distinctive ritual practices. Developing from around the 1st century CE and spreading throughout East Asia, Mahayana Buddhism has created a rich tapestry of practices designed to help all beings achieve enlightenment.

## Bodhisattva Ideal and Practices

The central organizing principle of Mahayana practice is the bodhisattva pathâ€”the aspiration to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.

### Bodhisattva Vows

At the heart of Mahayana practice lies the bodhisattva vow, typically expressed as:

1. **Beings are numberless; I vow to save them all**
2. **Delusions are inexhaustible; I vow to end them all**
3. **Dharma gates are boundless; I vow to master them all**
4. **The Buddha Way is unsurpassable; I vow to attain it**

These vows establish the practitioner's commitment to universal liberation rather than personal enlightenment alone.

### Stages of the Bodhisattva Path

Mahayana traditions outline systematic progressions along the bodhisattva path:

- **Generating bodhicitta**: The initial awakening of the mind of enlightenment
- **Five paths**: Accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, and no-more-learning
- **Ten bhumis (grounds)**: Progressive stages of bodhisattva development
- **Six (or ten) perfections**: Virtues cultivated along the path
- **Ultimate bodhisattvahood**: Approaching complete Buddhahood while remaining to help others

### Six Perfections (Paramitas)

The core practices for bodhisattva development include:

1. **Dana (Generosity)**: Material giving, fearlessness, and dharma teaching
2. **Sila (Ethics)**: Skillful conduct that avoids harm and benefits others
3. **Ksanti (Patience)**: Endurance, tolerance, and acceptance of difficulties
4. **Virya (Energy)**: Joyous effort and enthusiastic perseverance
5. **Dhyana (Meditation)**: Cultivation of mental stability and insight
6. **Prajna (Wisdom)**: Direct understanding of emptiness and interdependence

Some traditions add four additional perfections: skillful means, vows, power, and primordial wisdom.

## Compassion Practices

Mahayana Buddhism places particular emphasis on compassion (karuna) as inseparable from wisdom:
