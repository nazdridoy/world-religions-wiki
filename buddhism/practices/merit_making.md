# Buddhist Merit-Making Practices

Merit (Pali: *puñña*; Sanskrit: *puṇya*) represents a fundamental concept in Buddhist practice, referring to the positive karmic energy generated through virtuous actions. Merit-making encompasses a wide range of practices through which Buddhists accumulate spiritual currency that leads to favorable rebirth, supports spiritual progress, and can be dedicated to others. These practices form the backbone of everyday Buddhism for millions of practitioners worldwide, bridging formal doctrine and lived religious experience.
