# Buddhist Daily Practice

Buddhist daily practice refers to the integration of Buddhist principles, rituals, and meditation into everyday life. While formal meditation and temple visits are important aspects of Buddhism, the tradition emphasizes that genuine practice extends beyond these formal settings into all aspects of daily living. For both monastics and lay practitioners, daily practice creates a framework for applying Buddhist teachings to ordinary activities, transforming mundane experiences into opportunities for spiritual development.
