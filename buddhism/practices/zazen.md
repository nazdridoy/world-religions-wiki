# Zazen

Zazen (座禅), literally "seated meditation," is the cornerstone practice of Zen Buddhism. This distinctive form of meditation emphasizes direct experience over theoretical knowledge and aims to manifest the non-dual nature of reality through physically embodied awareness. In Zen tradition, zazen is not merely a technique but the very expression of enlightened awareness itself.

## Historical Development

### Origins in China

Zazen has its origins in Chinese Chan Buddhism, which itself was influenced by both Indian meditation traditions and indigenous Chinese philosophy:

- According to tradition, Bodhidharma (c. 5th-6th century CE) introduced a form of "wall-gazing" meditation when he brought Chan (Zen) Buddhism from India to China
- The Sixth Patriarch Huineng (638-713 CE) emphasized the non-dual nature of meditation, insisting that true meditation transcends both movement and stillness
- Chan Master Mazu (709-788 CE) famously declared, "Mind is Buddha," suggesting that meditation is not about becoming something but realizing what already is

### Transmission to Japan

Zen meditation was transmitted to Japan primarily through two important teachers:

- **Eisai** (1141-1215) introduced the Rinzai school after studying in China, emphasizing koan practice alongside zazen
- **Dogen** (1200-1253) founded the Soto school after his studies in China, placing zazen at the absolute center of practice

Dogen's masterwork, the *Shobogenzo*, contains his famous essay "Fukanzazengi" (Universal Recommendations for Zazen), which provides detailed instructions for zazen practice and articulates his concept of "just sitting" (shikantaza).

## Philosophy of Zazen

### Core Principles

Zazen is based on several distinctive philosophical principles:

1. **Non-duality of practice and enlightenment**: In Dogen's teaching of "practice-enlightenment," zazen is not a means to achieve enlightenment but the direct expression of enlightenment itself
2. **Original Buddha-nature**: Zazen is the manifestation of one's inherent Buddha-nature rather than an acquisition of something new
3. **Beyond thinking and not-thinking**: True zazen transcends both discursive thought and the suppression of thought
4. **Whole-body-and-mind engagement**: Zazen involves the entire psychophysical complex, not just the "mind"
5. **Goallessness**: Authentic zazen is practiced without seeking to attain anything

### Dogen's Perspective

Dogen, whose teachings remain central to the understanding of zazen, emphasized:

- "Zazen is not a meditation technique but the dharma gate of joyful ease"
- "To study the Buddha Way is to study the self; to study the self is to forget the self; to forget the self is to be actualized by myriad things"
- The concept of "shinjin-datsuraku" (dropping off body and mind), indicating the falling away of dualistic thinking

## Zazen Practice Methods

### Physical Aspects

#### Posture

The physical posture in zazen is considered crucial and includes:

- **Sitting position**: Either full lotus, half lotus, Burmese position, or seiza (kneeling)
- **Spine**: Straight but natural, as if "stacking vertebrae like coins"
- **Hands**: Cosmic mudra (hokkai-join) with hands in lap, right hand resting in left, thumbs lightly touching
- **Eyes**: Half-open, gaze resting about 3 feet in front, slightly downward
- **Chin**: Slightly tucked in, ears aligned with shoulders
- **Tongue**: Lightly touching the roof of the mouth behind upper teeth

#### Breathing

Breathing in zazen is:
- Natural and unforced
- Primarily abdominal
- Deep and slow
- Without intentional control or counting
- Often with slightly longer exhalation than inhalation

### Mental Aspects

Depending on the school and teacher, the mental aspect of zazen takes different forms:

#### 1. Shikantaza ("Just Sitting")

The primary practice in the Soto school:

- No object of meditation or focus
- Open awareness without attachment to any phenomenon
- Neither suppressing nor pursuing thoughts
- Complete presence with whatever arises
- "Thinking not-thinking" (hi-shiryo) - beyond both thinking and trying not to think

#### 2. Koan Practice

Especially emphasized in Rinzai Zen:

- Contemplating paradoxical statements or questions
- Classic koans include "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" or "What was your original face before your parents were born?"
- Working with a koan under a qualified teacher's guidance
- Aiming for intuitive breakthrough beyond rational understanding

#### 3. Breath Counting (Susokukan)

Often used for beginners:

- Counting exhalations from one to ten
- Returning to one after reaching ten or when losing count
- Gradually transitioning to breath awareness without counting
- Using counting as a support for concentration

## Structure of Zazen Practice

### Individual Practice

A typical zazen session includes:

1. **Preparation**: 
   - Arranging the meditation space
   - Bowing toward the cushion before sitting
   - Settling into the posture

2. **Main Practice**: 
   - Sitting for a predetermined period (typically 25-45 minutes)
   - Maintaining the posture and mental approach
   - Dealing with physical discomfort without adjustment when possible

3. **Closing**: 
   - Remaining still momentarily at the sound of the bell
   - Gently moving the body before standing
   - Bowing to the cushion

### Formal Zen Training Setting

In monasteries and practice centers, zazen typically follows a more elaborate structure:

- **Multiple periods**: Several periods of zazen (typically 30-40 minutes) with kinhin (walking meditation) between them
- **Ritualized transitions**: Precise forms for entering and leaving the meditation hall
- **Use of instruments**: Bells, wooden clappers, and drums to signal transitions
- **Kyosaku/keisaku**: A flat stick used by the meditation leader to strike the shoulders of practitioners who request it (to address sleepiness or stagnation)
- **Daisan/dokusan**: Private interviews with the teacher to discuss practice

## Challenges and Supports in Zazen

### Common Challenges

#### Physical Challenges
- Pain in legs, back, or knees
- Physical restlessness
- Sleepiness or dullness

#### Mental Challenges
- Mind wandering or planning
- Boredom or impatience
- Seeking experiences or attainments
- Doubt about the practice

### Supporting Elements

To address these challenges, Zen tradition offers:

- **Kinhin** (walking meditation) between sitting periods
- **Sangha** (community) support for sustained practice
- **Teisho** (dharma talks) providing context and inspiration
- **Sesshin** (intensive retreat periods) for deepening practice
- **Samu** (work practice) integrating meditation with activity

## Variations Across Zen Schools

### Soto Zen
- Emphasis on shikantaza ("just sitting")
- Facing the wall during zazen
- Equal emphasis on posture and mental state
- Long periods of sitting without dramatic breakthrough experiences

### Rinzai Zen
- Emphasis on koan practice
- Often facing into the room during zazen
- Focus on generating "great doubt" to precipitate awakening
- More dynamic approach, seeking kensho (insight) experiences

### Sanbo Kyodan and Western Hybrids
- Integration of elements from both Soto and Rinzai
- Sometimes incorporating breath counting or other concentration practices
- Often more accessible teaching methods for non-monastic practitioners
- May include elements of vipassana or other Buddhist traditions

## Integration with Daily Life

Zen tradition emphasizes that zazen extends beyond formal sitting periods:

### Extending Zazen Mind
- Bringing zazen awareness into all activities
- Applying posture principles while standing, walking, and working
- Maintaining present-moment awareness throughout daily tasks

### Work as Practice
- The principle of "samu" (work practice)
- Treating everyday activities as meditation
- Fully engaging with tasks without division between practice and non-practice

### Ritual Integration
- Meal practices (oryoki)
- Chanting services
- Bowing and prostrations
- Tea ceremony

## Modern Applications and Research

### Scientific Research
Studies have shown zazen practice may contribute to:
- Increased gray matter in brain regions associated with attention
- Reduced default mode network activity
- Enhanced immune function
- Improved emotional regulation
- Reduced stress and anxiety

### Contemporary Applications
- Secular mindfulness programs
- Corporate wellness initiatives
- Healthcare applications
- Educational settings
- Athletic performance enhancement

## Establishing a Zazen Practice

For beginners wishing to start zazen:

### Initial Steps
1. **Find proper instruction** from a qualified teacher if possible
2. **Start with shorter periods** (5-10 minutes) and gradually increase
3. **Create a dedicated space** with appropriate cushions (zafu and zabuton)
