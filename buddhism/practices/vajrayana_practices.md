# Vajrayana Practices

Vajrayana Buddhism, also known as Tantric Buddhism, Esoteric Buddhism, or the "Diamond Vehicle," represents a complex and multifaceted approach to Buddhist practice that developed primarily in India around the 6th-7th centuries CE before spreading to Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, and parts of China and Japan. Distinguished by its emphasis on specialized techniques for rapid enlightenment, Vajrayana incorporates elaborate rituals, visualization practices, and esoteric transmissions within a framework that maintains the fundamental Buddhist goals of enlightenment and compassion for all beings.
