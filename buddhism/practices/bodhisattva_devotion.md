# Bodhisattva Devotion in Buddhism

Devotion to bodhisattvas—enlightened beings who have vowed to remain in the cycle of rebirth to help all sentient beings—represents a cornerstone of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhist practice. While devotion to the historical Buddha is common across all Buddhist traditions, the specialized practices directed toward various bodhisattvas developed primarily within Mahayana Buddhism as it spread across East and Central Asia.

## Concept of the Bodhisattva

The bodhisattva ideal stands as one of Mahayana Buddhism's most distinctive contributions to religious thought:

### Definition and Evolution

- **Early concept**: Initially referred to the Buddha in his previous lives before enlightenment
- **Mahayana expansion**: Extended to include any being who generates bodhicitta (enlightenment mind)
- **Path model**: Developed into systematic bodhisattva path with ten stages (bhūmis)
- **Universal ideal**: Promoted as the highest aspiration for all practitioners
- **Celestial development**: Evolved to include cosmic, celestial bodhisattvas with specific powers

### Core Bodhisattva Vows

At the heart of bodhisattva practice are fundamental vows, typically formulated as:

1. Beings are numberless; I vow to save them all
2. Delusions are inexhaustible; I vow to end them all
3. Dharma gates are boundless; I vow to master them all
4. The Buddha Way is unsurpassable; I vow to attain it

### Bodhisattva Qualities

Devotees are drawn to bodhisattvas for their embodiment of:

- **Great compassion** (mahākaruṇā): Boundless care for all beings
