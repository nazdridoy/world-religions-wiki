# Ordination Procedures in Buddhism

Buddhist ordination represents one of the most significant transitions in religious life, marking the formal entry into the monastic community (Sangha). The process of becoming a monk (bhikkhu) or nun (bhikkhuni) has remained remarkably consistent across 2,500 years, though variations exist between different Buddhist traditions.

## Historical Background

The Buddha established the monastic order early in his teaching career when his first disciples requested a formal way to join his community. According to traditional accounts, the first ordination was remarkably simple—the Buddha merely said "Come, bhikkhu" (ehi bhikkhu) to invite followers into the Sangha.

As the community grew, more structured procedures developed:
- The Buddha first allowed senior monks to ordain disciples
- Later, a community of at least five or ten monks was required for ordination
- Eventually, formal questioning, preparation, and ceremonial elements were added

After the Buddha established the female monastic order, parallel procedures developed for women, generally requiring approval from both monk and nun communities.

## Types of Buddhist Ordination

Buddhist traditions recognize several levels of ordination:

### Preliminary Ordinations

**Samanera/Samaneri (Novice)**
- First step in monastic life for males and females
- Usually requires parental consent for minors
- Involves taking the Ten Precepts
- Often a prerequisite before full ordination
- Can be as young as 7-8 years old in some traditions

**Sikkhamana (Training Nun)**
- Two-year probationary period for women before full ordination in traditions with bhikkhuni lineages
- Observes Six Rules and additional precepts
- Prepares specifically for full female ordination

### Full Ordinations

**Bhikkhu (Fully Ordained Monk)**
- Takes the complete set of Vinaya rules (227-250 depending on tradition)
- Requires a minimum age (typically 20 years)
- Must have permission from parents if under 20
- Must be free from specific diseases and disqualifying conditions
- Must not have committed certain serious offenses

**Bhikkhuni (Fully Ordained Nun)**
- Takes 311-348 precepts depending on tradition
- Requires dual ordination from both monk and nun communities in traditions where this is preserved
- Subject to additional requirements beyond those for monks
- Currently available in East Asian traditions and revived in some Theravada contexts

## The Ordination Process
