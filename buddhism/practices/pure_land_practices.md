# Pure Land Buddhist Practices

Pure Land Buddhism represents one of the most widely practiced traditions within Mahayana Buddhism, offering devotion-centered approaches to spiritual cultivation focused on rebirth in Sukhavati, the Western Pure Land of Amitabha Buddha. This tradition combines faith, aspiration, and mindful practice to create accessible paths to liberation for practitioners of all capacities. Pure Land practices, while most prominent in East Asia, have influenced Buddhist practice across many cultures and continue to evolve in the modern world.
