# Nyingma Buddhism

Nyingma (རྙིང་མ་, "Ancient") is the oldest of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, tracing its origin to the first transmission of Buddhism to Tibet during the 8th century. Known as the "School of the Ancients," Nyingma preserves the earliest translations of Buddhist scriptures and maintains distinctive practices, particularly in the realm of Dzogchen meditation and the terma (hidden treasure) tradition.

## Historical Development

### Early Origins and First Diffusion

The Nyingma tradition emerged during the "Early Diffusion" (སྔ་དར་, ngadar) of Buddhism in Tibet:

## Core Doctrines and Practices

### Nine Yanas (Vehicles)

The Nyingma tradition organizes Buddhist teachings into nine progressive vehicles:

#### Outer Vehicles (Common to Other Buddhist Schools)
1. **Śrāvakayāna**: Path of the disciples seeking personal liberation
2. **Pratyekabuddhayāna**: Path of solitary realizers
3. **Bodhisattvayāna**: Path of the bodhisattva motivated by compassion for all beings

#### Inner Tantric Vehicles
4. **Kriyā Yoga**: Emphasis on external ritual acts
5. **Caryā Yoga**: Equal emphasis on external ritual and internal yoga
6. **Yoga Tantra**: Greater emphasis on internal yoga practices

#### Highest Yoga Tantras (Unique to Nyingma)
7. **Mahāyoga**: Generation stage practices
8. **Anuyoga**: Completion stage practices
9. **Atiyoga** (Dzogchen): Direct approach to recognizing primordial awareness

This system demonstrates the Nyingma view of Buddhist practice as a progressive path culminating in Dzogchen.

### Dzogchen: The Great Perfection

Dzogchen ("Great Perfection") is the pinnacle teaching of the Nyingma school:

- **Direct Recognition**: Immediate introduction to the nature of mind

- **Three Series**:
  - **Semde** (Mind Series): Nature of mind teachings
  - **Longde** (Space Series): Working with space and light
  - **Mengagde** (Secret Instruction Series): Direct pointing-out instructions

- **Rainbow Body**: Phenomenon where advanced practitioners' bodies dissolve into light at death
- **Ground, Path, Fruit**: Understanding of the inherently pure nature, the path of recognition, and the resultant manifestation

### Terma: The Treasure Tradition

The revelation of hidden treasures (terma) is a distinctive feature of Nyingma:

- **Definition**: Teachings concealed by Padmasambhava and his consort Yeshe Tsogyal
- **Purpose**: Preservation for future generations when the time is appropriate
- **Types**:
  - **Earth Treasures**: Physical objects discovered in nature
  - **Mind Treasures**: Revealed from the tertön's mind
  - **Pure Vision**: Received through visions of deities

- **Major Cycles**: Important terma collections including Longchen Nyingthig and Konchok Chidu

## Distinctive Features
