# Mahayana Buddhism

Mahayana Buddhism ("Great Vehicle") represents one of the three main branches of Buddhism, alongside Theravada and Vajrayana. It emerged around the 1st century CE and eventually became the predominant form of Buddhism in East Asia, significantly influencing the spiritual landscape of China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and parts of Central Asia.
