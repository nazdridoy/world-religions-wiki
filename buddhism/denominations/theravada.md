# Theravada Buddhism

Theravada (Pali: "Way of the Elders") is the oldest surviving Buddhist school, maintaining what its practitioners consider to be the original teachings and monastic discipline established by the Buddha. Often referred to as Southern Buddhism, it is predominantly practiced in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar (Burma), Laos, and Cambodia.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early History

Theravada traces its origins to the Sthaviravada school, one of the early Buddhist schools that emerged following the Second Buddhist Council, approximately 100 years after the Buddha's death. According to Theravada tradition, it represents the original, orthodox Buddhist doctrine preserved by the "elders" (theras) who were committed to maintaining the Buddha's teachings in their pure form.

The historical development of Theravada includes:

- **3rd Century BCE**: During Emperor Ashoka's reign, his son Mahinda brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka, establishing what would become the Theravada tradition
- **1st Century BCE**: The Pali Canon (Tipitaka) was first committed to writing in Sri Lanka
- **5th Century CE**: Buddhaghosa, a pivotal scholar-monk, composed the Visuddhimagga (Path of Purification) and commentaries on the Pali Canon
- **11th-13th Centuries CE**: Spread from Sri Lanka to Southeast Asia, becoming established in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos
- **19th Century**: Reform movements emerged in response to Western colonialism and modernization
- **20th Century**: International expansion to the West and revival movements in traditional Theravada countries

### Preservation of the Pali Canon

Central to Theravada's historical significance is its preservation of the Pali Canon (Tipitaka), considered the most complete collection of early Buddhist texts. This canon comprises:

- **Vinaya Pitaka**: Monastic rules and their origin stories
- **Sutta Pitaka**: Discourses attributed to the Buddha and his disciples
- **Abhidhamma Pitaka**: Philosophical and psychological analysis

## Key Doctrinal Features

### Emphasis on Early Buddhism

Theravada places primary importance on what it considers the Buddha's original teachings, with particular emphasis on:

- **Four Noble Truths**: The truth of suffering, its origin, cessation, and the path leading to its cessation
- **Noble Eightfold Path**: The Buddha's practical guide to ending suffering
- **Three Marks of Existence**: Impermanence (anicca), suffering/unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), and non-self (anatta)
- **Dependent Origination** (Paticcasamuppada): The causal chain explaining how suffering arises and ceases

### The Arhat Ideal

Unlike Mahayana Buddhism with its bodhisattva ideal, Theravada focuses on the attainment of Arhatship (Pali: Arahant), the state of complete liberation:

- An Arhat has eliminated all defilements and will not be reborn after death
- The path to Arhatship involves four stages of enlightenment: Stream-entry, Once-returner, Non-returner, and Arhatship
- While compassion is highly valued, the primary emphasis is on individual liberation through one's own effort

### Emphasis on Monasticism

The monastic community (Sangha) holds a central position in Theravada Buddhism:

- Monks (bhikkhus) and nuns (bhikkhunis) are considered the ideal practitioners
- Following the Vinaya rules in their original form is emphasized
- Monastics serve as preservers and transmitters of the Buddha's teachings
- The laity gains merit by supporting the monastic community

## Practices and Observances

### Meditation Approaches

Meditation forms the core of Theravada spiritual practice, with two main approaches:

1. **Samatha (Concentration) Meditation**:
   - Develops mental focus and tranquility
   - Includes techniques like breath meditation (anapanasati)
   - Can lead to jhanas (meditative absorptions)

2. **Vipassana (Insight) Meditation**:
   - Cultivates direct insight into the three marks of existence
   - Often begins with mindfulness of breathing or body scanning
   - Progresses through specific "insight knowledges"

### Monastic Life

Theravada monasticism follows the original Vinaya rules closely:

- Male monks follow 227 precepts; fully ordained nuns follow 311 precepts
- Daily routines include meditation, study, chanting, alms rounds, and monastery maintenance
- Traditionally emphasizes simplicity, with limited possessions
- Three robes, alms bowl, ritual items, and a few necessities are all that's allowed
- Various monastic traditions exist, including forest monasteries and urban temples

### Lay Practice

For lay practitioners, Theravada Buddhism emphasizes:

- **Five Precepts**: Abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxication
- **Dana (Generosity)**: Offering food, robes, and necessities to monastics
- **Uposatha Observance**: Following eight precepts on full moon, new moon, and quarter moon days
- **Merit-Making**: Actions like supporting monastics, offering to stupas, and acts of charity
- **Home Practice**: Maintaining a shrine, daily chanting, and meditation practice

### Festivals and Ceremonies

Important observances in the Theravada calendar include:

- **Vesak**: Celebrating the Buddha's birth, enlightenment, and passing
- **Kathina**: Offering of robes to monastics after the annual rains retreat
