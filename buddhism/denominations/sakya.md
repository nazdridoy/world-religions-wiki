# Sakya School of Tibetan Buddhism

The Sakya ("Grey Earth") school is one of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, known for its scholarly emphasis, systematic approach to tantric practice, and unique lineage transmission system. The name "Sakya" refers to the pale, grey-colored earth where its main monastery was built in southern Tibet. Distinguished by its balanced approach to study and practice, the Sakya tradition has produced many renowned scholars and meditation masters throughout its history.

## Origins and History

### Foundation in Tibet

Unlike some other Tibetan Buddhist traditions that trace their origins directly to Indian masters, the Sakya school was established in Tibet itself:

- **1073**: Khön Konchok Gyalpo (1034-1102), a member of the powerful Khön clan, founded Sakya Monastery in the Tsang region of southern Tibet
- The name "Sakya" comes from the pale grey soil (sa kya) of the location
- Khön Konchok Gyalpo had studied with the translator Drokmi Lotsawa, who had trained in India under master Virupa
- Drokmi transmitted the important Lamdre ("Path and its Fruit") teachings that became central to the Sakya tradition

### The Five Founding Masters

The Sakya tradition was established and systematized by five early masters known as "The Five Venerable Supreme Masters":

1. **Sachen Kunga Nyingpo** (1092-1158): Son of Khön Konchok Gyalpo, received the Lamdre teachings through visions of Manjushri
2. **Sonam Tsemo** (1142-1182): Eldest son of Sachen, renowned for his scholarly accomplishments
3. **Drakpa Gyaltsen** (1147-1216): Second son of Sachen, systematized many of the key Sakya teachings
4. **Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyaltsen** (1182-1251): Nephew of Drakpa Gyaltsen, Tibet's most famous scholar who codified Buddhist logic and epistemology
5. **Chogyal Phagpa** (1235-1280): Nephew and successor of Sakya Pandita, became Imperial Preceptor to Kublai Khan

### Political Rule of Tibet

The Sakya school was the first Buddhist tradition to rule Tibet politically:

- **1249-1254**: Sakya Pandita served as viceroy to Tibet under the Mongol Empire
- **1254-1280**: Chogyal Phagpa became Imperial Preceptor to Kublai Khan, receiving authority over Tibet
- **1254-1358**: Period of Sakya political dominance in Tibet under Mongol patronage
- **1358**: Sakya rule ended with the rise of the Phagmodrupa dynasty

### Later Historical Developments

After its period of political prominence, the Sakya school continued to develop:

- **14th-15th centuries**: Formation of two sub-traditions:
  - Sakya proper (Ngor lineage)
  - Tshar lineage
- **17th century**: Despite the rise of Gelug political power, Sakya maintained its spiritual influence
- **1959-present**: Following the Chinese occupation of Tibet, Sakya leaders established important centers in exile, particularly in India and Nepal

## Distinctive Features and Doctrine

### Lamdre: Path and its Fruit

The core teaching of the Sakya tradition is the Lamdre ("Path and its Fruit") system:

- Originally transmitted by the Indian mahasiddha Virupa
- Presents a complete path to enlightenment integrating sutra and tantra
- Includes "Triple Vision" teachings on:
  - Impure vision: Ordinary perception bound by delusion
  - Vision of experience: Gradual transformation through practice
  - Pure vision: Direct perception of reality as it is
- Traditionally taught as a complete cycle over several months

### Philosophical Approach

The Sakya school is known for its distinctive philosophical positions:

- **Freedom from Proliferation**: Emphasis on the inseparability of samsara and nirvana
- **Clarity-Emptiness**: Understanding of mind as inseparable union of clarity and emptiness
- **Extrinsic Emptiness** (Zhentong): View that buddha-nature is empty of everything other than itself
- **Indivisibility of Samsara and Nirvana**: Ultimate nature present in all phenomena

### Balancing Study and Practice

The Sakya tradition emphasizes:

- Thorough study of Buddhism's "five major and five minor sciences"
- Gradual approach moving from intellectual understanding to direct experience
- Integration of scholarly understanding with meditation experience
- Comprehensive training in both sutra and tantra approaches

### Parting from the Four Attachments

A core teaching that encapsulates the Sakya approach to practice:

1. If attached to this life, one is not a dharma practitioner
2. If attached to samsara, one does not have renunciation
3. If attached to self-interest, one does not have bodhicitta
4. If grasping arises, one does not have the view
