# Western Buddhism

Western Buddhism represents the adaptation and development of Buddhist traditions as they have been transmitted to Europe, North America, Australia, and other regions outside of Asia since the late 19th century. This process has created distinctive forms of Buddhist practice and understanding that reflect both the preservation of Asian traditions and innovative responses to Western cultural contexts.
