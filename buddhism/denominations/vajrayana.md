# Vajrayana Buddhism

Vajrayana Buddhism, also known as the "Diamond Vehicle," "Thunderbolt Vehicle," or "Tantric Buddhism," represents the third major branch of Buddhist traditions alongside Theravada and Mahayana. Distinguished by its esoteric practices, ritual elements, and accelerated path to enlightenment, Vajrayana emerged in India around the 7th century CE and found its fullest expression in the Himalayan regions, particularly Tibet.
