# Nichiren Buddhism

Nichiren Buddhism is a major Japanese Buddhist tradition founded by the 13th-century Buddhist priest Nichiren (1222-1282). Distinguished by its focus on the Lotus Sutra as the highest expression of the Buddha's teachings and its practice of chanting the daimoku (title of the Lotus Sutra), Nichiren Buddhism has evolved into one of the most influential and dynamic forms of Buddhism in the modern world.

## Historical Development

### Founder: Nichiren

Nichiren was born in 1222 in the fishing village of Kominato in Awa Province (present-day Chiba Prefecture):

- **Early Life**: Born to a fisherman's family, he entered the priesthood at age 11 at a local temple
- **Education**: Studied at major Buddhist centers including Mount Hiei, the headquarters of Tendai Buddhism
- **Spiritual Search**: After extensive study of Buddhist scriptures, concluded that the Lotus Sutra represented the Buddha's highest teaching
- **Declaration**: On April 28, 1253, at Seichō-ji temple, first chanted "Nam-myōhō-renge-kyō" and declared his unique teaching

### Persecution and Exile

Nichiren faced significant opposition for his criticism of other Buddhist schools:

- **Remonstrations**: Submitted critical memorials to the Kamakura government warning of impending disasters if the nation did not embrace the Lotus Sutra
- **Attempted Execution**: Narrowly escaped execution at Tatsunokuchi in 1271
- **Exile**: Banished to Sado Island (1271-1274) in harsh conditions
- **Final Years**: Retreated to Mount Minobu where he trained disciples and wrote numerous treatises

### Establishment of the Tradition

After Nichiren's death, his followers split into various lineages:

- **Six Senior Disciples**: Key disciples including Nikkō, Nichirō, Nichiji, Nicchō, Nittō, and Nichijō
- **Schism**: Major division between Nikkō and other disciples over proper interpretation of Nichiren's teachings
- **Temple Lineages**: Development of distinct temple-based lineages over subsequent centuries
- **Fuju Fuse**: Emergence of the uncompromising Fuju Fuse ("neither receiving nor giving") faction

### Modern Development

In the modern era, Nichiren Buddhism has experienced significant transformation:

- **Meiji Persecution**: Challenge of anti-Buddhist policies in the 19th century
- **Institutional Reorganization**: Consolidation of various Nichiren temples into organized sects
- **New Religious Movements**: Emergence of lay-based Nichiren organizations in the 20th century
- **Global Expansion**: Spread beyond Japan to become a global Buddhist tradition

## Core Teachings and Beliefs

### Primacy of the Lotus Sutra

Nichiren taught that the Lotus Sutra (Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra) represents the Buddha's ultimate teaching:

- **Perfect Teaching**: Contains the Buddha's complete and final message
- **Universal Buddhahood**: Reveals that all beings possess Buddha-nature and can attain enlightenment
- **Eternal Buddha**: Presents the Buddha as an eternal, cosmic being rather than merely a historical figure
- **One Vehicle**: Unifies all Buddhist paths into a single vehicle leading to Buddhahood

### The Daimoku

The central practice of Nichiren Buddhism is chanting the daimoku (title of the Lotus Sutra):

- **Nam-myōhō-renge-kyō**: "Devotion to the Mystic Law of the Lotus Sutra"
- **Practice-Realization Unity**: The chant itself contains the enlightenment it leads to
- **Faith, Practice, Study**: Three pillars of Nichiren Buddhist practice
- **Universal Practice**: Accessible to all people regardless of capacity or circumstances

### The Gohonzon

The object of devotion in Nichiren Buddhism:

- **Mandala**: A calligraphic representation of the Buddha-nature and the cosmic order described in the Lotus Sutra
- **Inscription**: Features "Nam-myōhō-renge-kyō" at the center with names of various buddhas, bodhisattvas, and protective deities
- **Function**: Serves as a mirror reflecting the practitioner's own inherent Buddha-nature
- **Veneration**: Focus of daily practice and devotion

### The Three Great Secret Laws

Nichiren outlined three essential elements of his teaching:

1. **The Object of Devotion** (honzon): The Gohonzon
2. **The Invocation** (daimoku): Chanting Nam-myōhō-renge-kyō
3. **The Platform of Ordination** (kaidan): The place of practice (interpreted differently by various schools)

### Rissho Ankoku Ron

One of Nichiren's most important treatises:

- **Title**: "On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land"
- **Theme**: Linking social and natural disasters to the embrace of "false" Buddhist teachings
- **Purpose**: Remonstration with the government to adopt the Lotus Sutra for national protection
- **Modern Interpretation**: Basis for social engagement in contemporary Nichiren Buddhism

### Mappo Theory

Nichiren's teaching was framed within the concept of mappō (末法, "latter day of the dharma"):

- **Three Ages**: Following the Buddha's death, the dharma passes through three periods:
  - True Dharma (shōbō): Buddha's teachings are properly practiced and enlightenment is attained
  - Semblance Dharma (zōbō): Buddhist teachings are practiced but enlightenment is rare
  - Latter Dharma (mappō): A degenerate age when the Buddha's teachings are misunderstood
- **Appropriate Practice**: Nichiren taught that in the mappō era, only the daimoku would be effective
