# Kagyu School of Tibetan Buddhism

The Kagyu (also spelled Kagyü) school is one of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, known particularly for its emphasis on meditation practice, guru devotion, and the direct oral transmission of teachings from master to disciple. The name "Kagyu" derives from the Tibetan term meaning "oral lineage" or "whispered transmission," highlighting the tradition's focus on direct experiential teachings passed down through an unbroken lineage of accomplished practitioners.

## Origins and History

### Indian Origins

The Kagyu lineage traces its origins to the Indian mahasiddhas (great adepts) of the 10th-11th centuries:

- **Tilopa** (988-1069): Considered the founding father of the lineage, who received direct transmissions from the primordial Buddha Vajradhara
- **Naropa** (1016-1100): Scholar-turned-yogi who left his prestigious position at Nalanda University to follow Tilopa and received the "Six Yogas of Naropa"

### Transmission to Tibet

The teachings were brought to Tibet by:

- **Marpa the Translator** (1012-1097): Made three arduous journeys from Tibet to India to study with Naropa and other masters, translating key texts into Tibetan
- **Milarepa** (1052-1135): Marpa's foremost disciple, renowned for his poetry, songs, and intensive meditation practice in caves, who attained enlightenment in one lifetime
- **Gampopa** (1079-1153): Combined Milarepa's Mahamudra teachings with the systematic approach of the Kadam tradition, establishing the monastic framework of the Kagyu school

### Development of Sub-schools

From Gampopa's students, the Kagyu tradition branched into four major and eight minor lineages:

**Four Major Lineages**:
- **Karma Kagyu**: Founded by Düsum Khyenpa, the First Karmapa (1110-1193)
- **Barom Kagyu**: Established by Barompa Darma Wangchug
- **Tsalpa Kagyu**: Founded by Zhang Yudrakpa Tsöndru Drakpa
- **Phagmo Drupa Kagyu**: Started by Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo

**Eight Minor Lineages** (stemming from Phagmo Drupa's disciples):
- Drikung Kagyu
- Taklung Kagyu
- Trophu Kagyu
- Drukpa Kagyu
- Martsang Kagyu
- Yelpa Kagyu
- Shukseb Kagyu
- Yazang Kagyu

Today, the Karma Kagyu, Drikung Kagyu, and Drukpa Kagyu remain the most prominent branches.

### Historical Development

The Kagyu school has gone through several significant historical phases:

- **12th-13th centuries**: Initial establishment and spread throughout Tibet
- **13th-17th centuries**: Period of significant growth and the establishment of major monasteries
- **17th-20th centuries**: Competition with the politically dominant Gelug school
- **1959-present**: Exile and global expansion following the Chinese occupation of Tibet

## Core Teachings and Practices

### Mahamudra

The central teaching of the Kagyu tradition is Mahamudra ("Great Seal"), a profound system for directly recognizing the nature of mind:

- **Sutra Mahamudra**: Approach based on the Prajnaparamita sutras and philosophical works
- **Tantra Mahamudra**: Approach utilizing tantric methods and visualization
- **Essence Mahamudra**: Direct pointing-out instructions to recognize mind's nature

The practice typically progresses through four stages:
1. One-pointed concentration
2. Simplicity (freedom from elaboration)
3. One taste (non-duality of appearances and mind)
4. Non-meditation (transcending the concept of practice)

### Six Yogas of Naropa

These advanced tantric practices form a core system of meditation in the Kagyu tradition:

1. **Tummo** (Inner Heat): Generation of mystic heat through visualization and breathing
2. **Gyulü** (Illusory Body): Recognition of all phenomena as dream-like appearances
3. **Ösel** (Clear Light): Recognition and stabilization of the mind's luminous nature
4. **Milam** (Dream Yoga): Maintaining awareness during dream states
5. **Bardo** (Intermediate State): Preparation for maintaining awareness during death and rebirth
6. **Phowa** (Consciousness Transfer): Practice for directing consciousness at the time of death

### Devotion to the Guru

The Kagyu school places exceptional emphasis on guru devotion:

- The guru is seen as the embodiment of enlightenment
- The "Four-Session Guru Yoga" practice is fundamental
- "Guru" refers not just to one's human teacher but to the essence of awakened mind

### Preliminary Practices (Ngöndro)

Before engaging in advanced practices, practitioners complete:

1. **Four Common Preliminaries**: Contemplations on:
   - Precious human birth
   - Impermanence and death
   - Karma and its effects
   - Sufferings of samsara

2. **Four Special Preliminaries**:
   - 100,000 prostrations
   - 100,000 Vajrasattva mantras for purification
   - 100,000 mandala offerings
   - 100,000 guru yoga practices

## Key Figures and Leadership

## Distinctive Features and Practices

### Meditation Emphasis

The Kagyu tradition is sometimes called the "practice lineage" due to its strong emphasis on meditation:

- Three-year, three-month, three-day retreats are standard for serious practitioners
- Balancing scholarly study with intensive meditation practice
- Focus on direct experience rather than intellectual understanding alone

### Black Crown Ceremony

Traditionally performed by the Karmapa, this ceremony involves:

- Wearing the sacred Black Crown, said to be woven from the hair of dakinis (female enlightened beings)
- The crown is believed to be normally invisible but was made physically manifest as a blessing
- Viewing the Black Crown ceremony is considered to confer instant liberation

### Relationship with Shamanic Practices

The Kagyu tradition, particularly in its early development:

- Incorporated elements of indigenous Tibetan Bön practices
