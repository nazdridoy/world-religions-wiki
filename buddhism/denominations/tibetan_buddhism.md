# Tibetan Buddhism

Tibetan Buddhism represents one of Buddhism's most distinctive and complex traditions, characterized by its integration of Mahayana philosophical teachings with Vajrayana (tantric) practices. Developing in the unique geographic and cultural isolation of the Himalayan plateau, Tibetan Buddhism synthesized Indian Buddhist traditions with indigenous Tibetan beliefs and practices to create a rich spiritual tradition that has greatly influenced the culture, politics, and social fabric of Tibet, Bhutan, Mongolia, and parts of Nepal, India, and Russia.
