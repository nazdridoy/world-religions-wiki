# Japanese Buddhism

Buddhism entered Japan in the 6th century CE and underwent a profound transformation, developing unique schools and practices that reflected Japanese cultural sensibilities. Over its 1,500-year history in Japan, Buddhism has deeply influenced Japanese art, architecture, literature, and social institutions while evolving into forms distinct from its continental Asian counterparts.
