# Engaged Buddhism

Engaged Buddhism refers to the application of Buddhist principles and practices to address social, political, environmental, and economic suffering in the contemporary world. This movement represents a significant development in modern Buddhism, emphasizing that spiritual practice should not be separated from social action, and that inner transformation and societal change are interconnected aspects of the Buddhist path.
