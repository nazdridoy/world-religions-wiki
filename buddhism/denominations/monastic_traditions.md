# Monastic Traditions in Buddhism

Monasticism forms the backbone of Buddhist institutional life across all major traditions. Since the time of the Buddha, the monastic community (Sangha) has served as the primary vehicle for preserving and transmitting Buddhist teachings. While maintaining core principles established by the Buddha, monastic practices, regulations, and lifestyles have evolved differently across Buddhist denominations, reflecting cultural adaptations and doctrinal emphases.
