# The Early Buddhist Schism

The first major division in Buddhist history occurred approximately 100 years after the Buddha's death (parinirvana), traditionally dated around 383 BCE. This schism split the original Sangha (monastic community) into two main groups: the Sthavira ("Elders") and the Mahasanghika ("Great Assembly" or "Majority Community"). This division marked the beginning of sectarian Buddhism and set the stage for the later development of diverse Buddhist schools across Asia.

## Historical Context

### The Second Buddhist Council

According to traditional accounts, the schism occurred during or shortly after the Second Buddhist Council, held at Vaishali (in present-day Bihar, India). The council was convened to address disputes about monastic discipline (Vinaya):

- **Traditional date**: Approximately 100 years after the Buddha's parinirvana (c. 383 BCE)
- **Modern scholarly estimates**: Between 4th-3rd centuries BCE
- **Location**: Vaishali, an important city in ancient India
- **Reason**: To resolve controversies regarding monastic discipline

### The Ten Points Controversy

The immediate cause of the council was a dispute over ten practices allegedly adopted by monks from Vaishali (known as the Vajjian monks):

1. Storing salt in a horn container
2. Eating after midday
3. Going to another village and eating again the same day
4. Holding monastic ceremonies separately within the same boundary
5. Obtaining approval for an action after it was done
6. Following habitual practices
7. Accepting unfermented milk after meals
8. Consuming mild alcoholic drinks
9. Using luxurious mats
10. Accepting gold and silver (money)

The more conservative monks viewed these practices as violations of the Vinaya rules, while the Vajjian monks defended them as permissible.

## The Schism

### Traditional Account

According to traditional sources, the council ruled against the Vajjian monks, declaring the ten practices impermissible. However, disagreements persisted:

1. The council's decisions were rejected by a larger group of monks
2. This group held their own separate council
3. They came to be known as the Mahasanghika ("Great Assembly")
4. Those who upheld the council's original rulings became known as Sthavira ("Elders")

### Scholarly Perspectives

Modern scholarship suggests a more complex picture:

- The schism may not have occurred immediately after the Second Council
- Multiple factors beyond the ten points likely contributed to the division
- Political and regional differences may have played significant roles
- The actual division may have happened gradually over decades

## Doctrinal Differences

While the initial split centered on Vinaya (disciplinary) issues, doctrinal differences soon emerged between the two groups:

### Sthavira Views

The Sthavira ("Elders") held more conservative positions:

- **Buddha's nature**: The historical Buddha was an ordinary human who attained enlightenment
- **Arhatship**: Arhats were fully liberated beings who had eliminated all defilements
- **Gradual path**: Emphasized a step-by-step path to liberation
- **Canon**: More conservative regarding what constituted the Buddha's teachings
- **Abhidharma**: Developed systematic analysis of mental and physical phenomena

### Mahasanghika Views

The Mahasanghika ("Great Assembly") developed more progressive positions:

- **Buddha's nature**: The Buddha possessed supramundane (lokottara) qualities
- **Bodhisattva ideal**: Greater emphasis on the bodhisattva path
- **Arhatship**: Arhats still retained certain imperfections
- **Direct path**: More emphasis on direct insight
- **Canon**: More open to variant interpretations and potentially new teachings

These doctrinal differences, though initially subtle, provided conceptual foundations for later developments, particularly the emergence of Mahayana Buddhism.

## Historical Significance

The Sthavira-Mahasanghika schism had profound implications for Buddhist history:

### Catalyst for Sectarian Development

The initial division catalyzed further splits within both groups:

- **Sthavira**: Eventually subdivided into numerous schools including Sarvastivada, Vibhajyavada (from which Theravada emerged), and Pudgalavada
- **Mahasanghika**: Developed into several sub-schools including Lokottaravada, Ekavyavaharika, and Caitika

### Doctrinal Elaboration

The competition between groups stimulated philosophical development:

- Enhanced analysis of the Buddha's teachings
- Development of sophisticated Abhidharma systems
- Discussion of the nature of Buddhahood and liberation
- Refinement of meditation theory and practice
- Clarification of monastic discipline

### Seeds of Later Developments

The schism planted seeds for major later developments in Buddhism:

- **Mahayana emergence**: Many Mahayana concepts have parallels in Mahasanghika views
- **Theravada tradition**: Emerged from the Sthavira branch through the Vibhajyavada school
- **Diverse Abhidharma systems**: Different analytical approaches to Buddhist psychology
- **Expanded Buddhist geography**: Different schools flourished in different regions

## Regional Distribution

The two lineages established distinctive regional presences:

### Sthavira Influence

- **South**: Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia (developing into Theravada)
- **Northwest**: Kashmir and Gandhara (Sarvastivada)
- **Central Asia**: Spread via the Silk Road (Sarvastivada and Dharmaguptaka)
- **China**: Early translations from Sarvastivada and Dharmaguptaka texts

### Mahasanghika Influence

- **Eastern India**: Particularly around Magadha and Bengal
- **Andhra region**: Southern India became a stronghold
- **Central India**: Areas around present-day Madhya Pradesh
- **Later influence**: Concepts absorbed into emerging Mahayana traditions

## Textual Evidence

Our understanding of the early schism comes from multiple sources:

### Primary Sources

- **Vinaya accounts**: Different versions preserved in Chinese, Pali, and Tibetan
- **Inscriptions**: Archaeological evidence including Ashoka's edicts
- **Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa**: Sri Lankan chronicles describing early Buddhist history
- **Samayabhedoparacanacakra**: Vasumitra's treatise on the formation of different schools

### Challenges in Interpretation

Scholars face several challenges in reconstructing the early schism:

- **Sectarian bias**: Each tradition's account favors its own legitimacy
- **Late composition**: Most sources were written centuries after the events
- **Multiple versions**: Contradictory accounts of how and why the schism occurred
- **Limited archaeological evidence**: Few physical remains from this early period

## Later Developments

The two groups continued to evolve in different directions:

### Sthavira Legacy

The Sthavira tradition eventually gave rise to:

- **Theravada**: The only surviving early Buddhist school, predominant in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia
- **Sarvastivada**: Influential in North India, Kashmir, and Central Asia; developed extensive Abhidharma literature
- **Dharmaguptaka**: Influential in Central Asia and China; its Vinaya is still used in East Asian Buddhism

### Mahasanghika Legacy

The Mahasanghika developed into:

- Various sub-schools that eventually disappeared as distinct entities
- Contributed concepts that influenced the development of Mahayana Buddhism
- Left textual evidence including the Mahavastu and portions of the Chinese Agamas

## Modern Significance

The early schism continues to be significant for several reasons:

- **Historical understanding**: Provides insight into Buddhism's early development
- **Sectarian identity**: Helps explain the origins of different Buddhist traditions
- **Doctrinal diversity**: Illuminates how Buddhist thought evolved and diversified
- **Contemporary dialogue**: Informs modern inter-Buddhist ecumenical efforts

## Scholarly Debates

Several aspects of the early schism remain debated among scholars:

- **Chronology**: Exact dating of the schism and related events
- **Causality**: Whether Vinaya disputes or doctrinal differences were primary
- **Mahayana connection**: Precise relationship between Mahasanghika and later Mahayana
- **Political factors**: Role of royal patronage and regional politics
- **Textual reliability**: How accurately later sources describe the early events
