# Buddhist Denominations and Schools

Buddhism has evolved into numerous distinct traditions as it spread from India to different regions of Asia and eventually around the world. While all Buddhist schools share foundational principles like the Four Noble Truths, they differ in their interpretations, practices, and cultural expressions.

## Major Buddhist Traditions

Buddhism is commonly divided into three major traditions, often called "vehicles" (yanas), each with its own sub-schools:

### 1. [Theravada Buddhism](./theravada.md)

Theravada ("Way of the Elders") represents the oldest surviving Buddhist school. It emphasizes:
- Direct study of original Pali Canon texts
- Individual liberation through monastic practice
- Strict adherence to Vinaya (monastic discipline)
- Meditation focused on mindfulness and insight
- A more historical, human view of the Buddha

**Geographic presence**: Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and parts of Vietnam and Bangladesh

### 2. [Mahayana Buddhism](./mahayana.md)

Mahayana ("Great Vehicle") emerged around the 1st century CE and introduced new concepts and sutras. It emphasizes:
- Universal liberation of all beings through the Bodhisattva ideal
- Compassion as equal to wisdom in importance
- Additional scriptures beyond the Pali Canon
- Philosophy focused on emptiness (sunyata) and Buddha-nature
- A more cosmic, transcendent view of the Buddha
