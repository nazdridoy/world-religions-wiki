# Buddhist Ecumenism

Buddhist ecumenism encompasses the various movements, organizations, and attitudes that promote dialogue, cooperation, and mutual understanding among different Buddhist traditions. In contrast to historical patterns where different schools often maintained separate institutional and doctrinal boundaries, ecumenical approaches emphasize shared foundations while respecting the diversity of Buddhist expressions that have developed across cultures and time periods.
