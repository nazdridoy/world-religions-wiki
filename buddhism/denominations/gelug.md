# Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism

The Gelug ("Way of Virtue") school is the youngest yet most widespread school of Tibetan Buddhism, founded in the late 14th century by Je Tsongkhapa. Often referred to as the "Yellow Hat" tradition due to the distinctive yellow hats worn by its monks during certain ceremonies, the Gelug school became the dominant political and spiritual force in Tibet from the mid-17th century until the Chinese occupation in 1959.

## Origins and History

### Foundation by Tsongkhapa

Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419), born in the Amdo region of Tibet, was a remarkable scholar who studied with masters from all existing Tibetan Buddhist traditions before establishing the Gelug lineage. After extensive study and practice, Tsongkhapa became concerned about what he perceived as a decline in monastic discipline and proper understanding of Buddhist philosophy.

Key developments in the school's founding include:

- **1409**: Tsongkhapa established the Great Prayer Festival (Monlam Chenmo) in Lhasa
- **1409**: Founding of Ganden Monastery, the first and original center of the Gelug tradition
- **1416**: Completion of Tsongkhapa's masterwork, "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" (Lamrim Chenmo)
- **1419**: Upon Tsongkhapa's death, his disciple Gyaltsab Je became the first Ganden Tripa (throne-holder of Ganden)

### Rise to Political Power

The Gelug school gradually rose to political prominence in Tibet:

- **1447**: Founding of Tashilhunpo Monastery by Gendun Drup, later recognized as the 1st Dalai Lama
- **1578**: Altan Khan, a Mongol ruler, bestowed the title "Dalai Lama" ("Ocean of Wisdom") upon Sonam Gyatso, the third incarnation of Gendun Drup
- **1642**: The 5th Dalai Lama, Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso (1617-1682), established the Ganden Phodrang government with Mongol military support, unifying Tibet under Gelug authority
- **1645-1705**: Construction of the Potala Palace, the massive residence of the Dalai Lamas in Lhasa

### Modern Era

In recent history, the Gelug school has experienced significant challenges and changes:

- **1959**: The 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet following the Chinese occupation, establishing the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India
- **1960s-Present**: Establishment of major Gelug monasteries in exile, particularly in south India
- **Contemporary**: Despite restrictions in Tibet, the Gelug tradition continues to flourish internationally with centers worldwide

## Philosophical Approach

The Gelug school is known for its rigorous scholarly approach to Buddhism, with particular emphasis on:

### Madhyamaka Philosophy

Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Madhyamaka (Middle Way) philosophy emphasizes:

- The synthesis of Prasangika Madhyamaka views with logical analysis
- Emptiness (śūnyatā) as the absence of inherent existence rather than nihilism
- The compatibility of conventional existence with ultimate emptiness

### Lamrim (Stages of the Path)

Based on Atisha's earlier work, Tsongkhapa systematized the entire Buddhist path in his Lamrim teachings:

- Graduated approach to practice suitable for different capacities
- Three principal aspects of the path: renunciation, bodhicitta (awakening mind), and correct view of emptiness
- Integration of all Buddhist teachings into a coherent progressive system

### Integration of Sutra and Tantra

The Gelug approach uniquely emphasizes:

- The necessary foundation of ethical discipline and philosophical understanding before tantric practice
- Systematic study of the five major texts: Abhisamayālaṃkāra, Madhyamakāvatāra, Pramāṇavārttika, Abhidharmakośa, and Vinaya
- The view that tantra should be practiced only after mastering sutra teachings

## Monastic Education and Practice

### Monastic Curriculum

Gelug monasticism features a highly structured educational system:

1. **Preliminary studies**: Memorization of texts, debate procedures, ritual practices
2. **Geshe curriculum**: 15-25 years of intensive study covering five major topics:
   - Perfection of Wisdom (Prajñāpāramitā)
   - Middle Way Philosophy (Madhyamaka)
   - Valid Cognition (Pramāṇa)
   - Phenomenology (Abhidharma)
   - Monastic Discipline (Vinaya)
3. **Higher studies**: Selected scholars continue to tantric colleges for advanced study

### Debate Practice

Dialectical debate is central to Gelug education:

- Formalized debate with specific physical gestures and verbal formulas
- Daily debate sessions in monastery courtyards
- Annual debate competitions between monasteries
- Purpose: To sharpen analytical skills and internalize philosophical points

### Tantric Practices

While emphasizing scholarly study, the Gelug tradition includes:

- Complete systems of tantric practice, particularly focusing on Guhyasamāja, Cakrasaṃvara, and Vajrabhairava tantras
- The Six Yogas of Naropa: inner heat, illusory body, clear light, dream yoga, transference of consciousness, and bardo yoga
- Rigorous preliminary practices (ngöndro) before engaging in advanced tantric methods
