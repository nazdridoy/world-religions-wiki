# Early Buddhist Schools

In the centuries following the Buddha's passing (parinirvana), Buddhism gradually divided into numerous distinct schools or sects, each with their own interpretations of doctrine, monastic discipline, and canonical texts. These early schools, often called the "Eighteen Schools" though their actual number varied, represent the first major diversification of the Buddhist tradition before the later emergence of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism.

## Historical Development

### Formation Process

The emergence of separate schools occurred through a gradual process:

- **Initial Unity**: For approximately the first century after the Buddha's death, the sangha (monastic community) remained largely unified
- **First Council** (c. 483 BCE): Held shortly after the Buddha's death to compile his teachings
- **Second Council** (c. 383 BCE): Convened to address monastic disciplinary issues, leading to the first major schism
- **Root Schism**: Division between the conservative Sthaviravada ("Doctrine of the Elders") and the more liberal Mahasanghika ("Great Community")
- **Further Divisions**: During the following centuries, particularly after Emperor Ashoka's reign (3rd century BCE), these two main branches subdivided into numerous schools
- **Geographic Spread**: Different schools became dominant in different regions as Buddhism spread throughout South and Southeast Asia

### The Eighteen Schools

Traditional accounts mention eighteen early schools, though historical records suggest more:

- **Sthaviravada Branch**: Gave rise to schools including Sarvastivada, Vibhajyavada, Vatsiputriya, Dharmaguptaka, and Mahisasaka
- **Mahasanghika Branch**: Developed into schools such as Ekavyavaharika, Lokottaravada, Gokulika, Bahuśrutīya, and Prajñaptivada
- **Theravada**: Descended from the Vibhajyavada school, it is the only early school to survive intact to the present day
- **Key Development Periods**: Particularly active diversification occurred in the 3rd century BCE and again in the 1st century CE

## Major Early Schools

### Theravada (Surviving School)

The only early school that continues as a living tradition today:

- **Origins**: Descended from the Vibhajyavada branch of Sthaviravada
- **Geographic Presence**: Originally established in Sri Lanka around 250 BCE, later spreading to Southeast Asia
- **Textual Tradition**: Preserved their canon in Pali language (the Tipitaka)
- **Key Doctrines**: Emphasis on arahantship as the goal, analysis of mind and matter, rejection of the concept of "person" (pudgala)
- **Modern Continuation**: Currently practiced throughout Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos

### Sarvastivada (All Exists)

One of the most influential early schools:

- **Distinctive Doctrine**: Belief that all dharmas (phenomena) exist in past, present, and future
- **Popularity**: Became dominant in northern India, particularly Kashmir
- **Abhidharma Development**: Produced the extensive Mahavibhasa and Abhidharmakosa
- **Influence**: Significantly shaped later Buddhist philosophical development
- **Decline**: Gradually disappeared from India after the 7th century CE

### Pudgalavada (Personalists)

Known for their controversial "person" theory:

- **Central Claim**: Assertion of a "pudgala" (person) that is neither identical to nor different from the five aggregates
- **Main Branches**: Vatsiputriya and Sammitiya schools
- **Motivation**: Attempting to explain continuity of rebirth and karmic responsibility
- **Criticism**: Other Buddhist schools considered this view dangerously close to a self/soul theory
- **Historical Significance**: At one point may have been the most numerous Buddhist school in India

### Dharmaguptaka

Important for spreading Buddhism to Central and East Asia:

- **Vinaya Tradition**: Their monastic code became standard throughout East Asian Buddhism
- **Canon**: Maintained a distinctive set of texts, including an expanded Dharmapada
- **Additional Texts**: Emphasized texts like the Śāriputra Abhidharma Śāstra
- **Geographic Spread**: Particularly influential in Gandhara and along the Silk Road to China
- **Distinctive Practices**: Special veneration of the Buddha, stupas, and certain sutras

### Mahisasaka

A significant school related to both Sarvastivada and Dharmaguptaka:

- **Geographic Presence**: Mainly in western and southern India
- **Doctrinal Position**: Middle ground between Sarvastivada and Vibhajyavada
- **Vinaya**: Preserved a distinct monastic code
- **Abhidharma**: Developed their own philosophical analysis
- **Relationship to Theravada**: Some textual and doctrinal similarities

### Mahasanghika and Its Offshoots

The more progressive branch following the first major schism:

- **Origins**: Formed after disagreements at the Second Council
- **Buddha Concept**: Tendency toward a more transcendent view of the Buddha
- **Bodhisattva Emphasis**: Greater importance placed on the bodhisattva path
- **Proto-Mahayana Elements**: Many scholars see Mahasanghika views as precursors to Mahayana concepts
- **Sub-schools**: Included Lokottaravada, which held that the Buddha was supramundane

## Doctrinal Differences

### Views on the Buddha

Early schools differed in their understanding of the Buddha's nature:

- **Historical vs. Transcendent**: Ranging from viewing the Buddha as primarily a human teacher (Sthaviravada tendency) to seeing him as a transcendent being (Mahasanghika tendency)
- **Buddha Bodies**: Early development of the multiple-body theory later elaborated in Mahayana
- **Omniscience**: Debates about the extent of the Buddha's knowledge
- **Physical Perfection**: Whether the Buddha's body had ordinary human needs and limitations
- **Continuing Influence**: Whether the Buddha could continue to help beings after parinirvana

### Abhidharma Systems

Schools developed distinct philosophical systems:

- **Dharma Theory**: Different classifications and understandings of fundamental phenomena
- **Momentariness**: Theories about the duration of dharmas (instantaneous vs. extended)
- **Causality**: Various models explaining how causes produce effects
- **Time**: Whether past and future phenomena have actual existence (Sarvastivada) or only present phenomena exist (Vibhajyavada)
- **Mind Analysis**: Differing analyses of mental factors and consciousness

### Path and Fruition

Variations in understanding spiritual practice and attainment:

- **Arahant vs. Bodhisattva**: Emphasis on individual liberation versus universal liberation
- **Gradual vs. Sudden**: Whether enlightenment occurs gradually or suddenly
- **Insight Development**: Different methods for cultivating wisdom
- **Meditative States**: Varying interpretations of jhana/dhyana states
- **Liberation Process**: Disagreements about the exact nature of freedom from defilements

### Ontological Questions

Fundamental questions about the nature of reality:

- **Ultimate Reality**: What constitutes the final truth about existence
- **Emptiness (Sunyata)**: Early conceptions of emptiness before Mahayana elaboration
- **Person Theory**: Whether there is any sense in which a "person" exists beyond the five aggregates
- **Momentariness**: Whether all phenomena are instantaneous or have some duration
- **Atomism**: Theories about the fundamental building blocks of material reality

## Textual Traditions

### Canon Development

Each school maintained its own collection of texts:

- **Language Differences**: Canons preserved in Pali, Sanskrit, various Prakrits, and later Chinese and Tibetan
- **Agama/Nikaya Collections**: Similar but not identical collections of the Buddha's discourses
- **Additional Sutras**: Some schools recognized texts not accepted by others
- **Vinaya Variations**: Different versions of monastic rules and their interpretation
- **Abhidharma Development**: Each major school created its own systematic philosophical texts

### Key Surviving Texts

Important textual sources for understanding early schools:

- **Pali Canon**: Complete canon of the Theravada school
- **Chinese Agamas**: Translations of texts from various schools, especially Dharmaguptaka and Sarvastivada
- **Abhidharmakosa**: Vasubandhu's summary of Sarvastivada Abhidharma (with criticism)
