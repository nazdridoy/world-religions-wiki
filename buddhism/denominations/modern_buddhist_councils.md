# Modern Buddhist Councils

Buddhist councils (sangīti) have played a crucial role throughout Buddhist history as formal gatherings where monastics and scholars meet to preserve, clarify, and sometimes revise Buddhist doctrine and practice. While ancient councils focused primarily on establishing canonical texts and monastic rules within specific traditions, modern Buddhist councils have often emphasized cross-traditional dialogue, contemporary application of Buddhist principles, and responses to global challenges facing Buddhism in the modern world.
