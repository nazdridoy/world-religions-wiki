# Chinese Buddhism

Buddhism entered China during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) and underwent a profound transformation as it adapted to Chinese culture and thought. Over nearly two millennia, Chinese Buddhism developed unique characteristics, established distinctive schools, and deeply influenced Chinese civilization while spreading to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.
