# Buddhist Texts and Scriptures

Buddhist sacred texts represent one of the most extensive collections of religious writings in the world. From the earliest oral traditions to later written works, these texts form the foundation of Buddhist thought across all major traditions.

## Overview of Buddhist Canons

Unlike religions with a single authoritative scripture, Buddhism has developed multiple canons of texts across different traditions. These canons include:

- [Pali Canon (Tipitaka)](./pali_canon.md) - The earliest complete Buddhist canon, used primarily in Theravada Buddhism
- [Chinese Buddhist Canon](./chinese_canon.md) - Used primarily in East Asian Buddhism
- [Tibetan Canon](./tibetan_canon.md) - Consisting of the Kangyur and Tengyur collections

## Early Buddhist Texts

- [The First Sermon](./first_sermon.md) - The Buddha's teaching on the Four Noble Truths

## The Pali Canon (Tipitaka)

The Pali Canon is the earliest complete collection of Buddhist texts, compiled shortly after the Buddha's death and written down in Sri Lanka around 29 BCE. It consists of three "baskets" (pitaka):

1. **Vinaya Pitaka** - Rules and procedures for monastic life
   - [Monastic Rules](./vinaya_pitaka.md) - Detailed regulations for monks and nuns
   
2. **Sutta Pitaka** - Discourses of the Buddha
