# Early Buddhist Texts

Early Buddhist Texts (EBTs) refer to the oldest extant Buddhist scriptures, which are generally considered to contain the closest approximations to the actual teachings of the historical Buddha. These texts form the foundation of Buddhist doctrine across all traditions and represent the earliest layer of Buddhist literature before significant sectarian developments.

## Historical Context

### Dating and Composition

The chronology of early Buddhist texts spans several centuries:

- **The Buddha's lifetime**: c. 563-483 BCE (traditional dating) or c. 480-400 BCE (scholarly consensus)
- **Oral transmission period**: c. 5th-1st centuries BCE
- **First written records**: c. 1st century BCE (Pali Canon in Sri Lanka)
- **Earliest physical manuscripts**: 1st century CE (Gandhāran birch-bark manuscripts)

Scholars generally recognize several developmental layers:

1. **Core sutras/suttas**: Texts likely closest to the Buddha's original teachings
2. **Early expansions**: Elaborations and systematizations of core teachings
3. **Pre-sectarian developments**: Material common to all early schools
4. **Early sectarian texts**: Material showing sectarian doctrinal differences

### Languages and Transmission

Early Buddhist texts were transmitted in various languages:

- **Middle Indo-Aryan dialects**: The Buddha likely taught in one or more Prakrit languages (possibly Magadhi or Ardhamagadhi)
- **Pali**: The language of the Theravāda canon, likely a western Indian dialect rather than the Buddha's original language
- **Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit**: Used in some Sarvāstivāda and Mahāsāṃghika texts
- **Gāndhārī**: Regional Prakrit used in early manuscripts from Gandhāra region
- **Sanskrit**: Later translations and compositions, especially in Sarvāstivāda and Mahāyāna contexts

### Preservation and Transmission Routes

Different geographical and sectarian routes preserved these texts:

- **Southern Transmission**: Texts transmitted to Sri Lanka and later Southeast Asia, preserved in Pali
- **Northern Transmission**: Texts transmitted to Central Asia, China, Tibet, and East Asia, mostly in Sanskrit and translations
- **Gandhāran Transmission**: Recently discovered texts from Afghanistan/Pakistan region in Gāndhārī language
- **Archaeological discoveries**: Fragmentary manuscripts from various sites across Asia

2. **Majjhima Nikāya/Madhyama Āgama** (Middle-Length Discourses): 152 suttas of moderate length covering diverse topics
   - Notable texts: Mūlapariyāya Sutta, Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, Alagaddūpama Sutta

3. **Saṃyutta Nikāya/Saṃyukta Āgama** (Connected Discourses): Thousands of shorter texts arranged by topic into 56 groups
   - Notable sections: Khandha-saṃyutta (aggregates), Saḷāyatana-saṃyutta (sense bases), Sacca-saṃyutta (truths)

4. **Aṅguttara Nikāya/Ekottarika Āgama** (Numerical Discourses): Thousands of short suttas arranged numerically from 1-11 factors
   - Notable content: Practical teachings on ethics, meditation, and community life

#### Additional Collections:

- **Khuddaka Nikāya** (Minor Collection): Contains some of the oldest texts (Dhammapada, Sutta Nipāta) alongside later additions

### The Vinaya Piṭaka

Texts concerning monastic discipline, containing both rules and their origin stories:

- **Suttavibhaṅga**: Analysis of the monastic rules (227 for monks, 311 for nuns)
- **Khandhaka**: Regulations for communal procedures and monastic life
- **Parivāra**: Summaries and analyses of the rules (later addition)

Multiple Vinaya recensions survive:

1. **Theravāda Vinaya**: Complete in Pali
2. **Dharmaguptaka Vinaya**: Complete in Chinese (used in East Asian Buddhism)
3. **Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya**: Mostly complete in Tibetan
4. **Other partial recensions**: Fragments of Mahāsāṃghika, Mahīśāsaka, and Sarvāstivāda Vinayas

### Abhidharma/Abhidhamma Collections

Early systematic philosophical analyses of doctrine (partially early, with later elaborations):

- **Theravāda Abhidhamma**: Seven books analyzing phenomena (dhammas)
- **Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma**: Seven books taking a different analytical approach

Though traditionally attributed to the Buddha, scholars consider these as later systematizations, with only portions potentially dating to the early period.

## Characteristic Features

### Literary Style and Structure

Distinctive features help identify early Buddhist texts:

- **Formulaic repetition**: Standard phrases and passages repeated throughout
- **Stock narratives**: Common introductory and transitional scenarios
- **Mnemonic devices**: Numbered lists, verse summaries, and question-answer formats
- **Progressive teaching**: Graduated presentation from basic to advanced concepts
- **Opening formula**: "Thus have I heard, at one time..." (Evam me sutaṃ...)
- **Geographic and cultural setting**: Consistent references to ancient North Indian locations and customs

### Doctrinal Content

Core teachings found consistently across early texts:

- **Four Noble Truths**: The reality of suffering, its origin, cessation, and the path
- **Noble Eightfold Path**: The middle way between asceticism and indulgence
- **Three Marks of Existence**: Impermanence (anicca), suffering/unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), and non-self (anattā)
- **Dependent Origination** (paṭicca-samuppāda): The twelve-link causal chain explaining the arising and cessation of suffering
- **Five Aggregates** (khandhas/skandhas): Form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness
- **Six Sense Bases** (saḷāyatana): Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, and their objects

- **Debate narratives**: Encounters with other religious teachers

## Scholarly Approaches

### Text-Critical Methods

Modern scholarship applies various methodologies:

- **Comparative analysis**: Studying parallel versions in different languages and transmissions
- **Linguistic analysis**: Examining language features to determine relative age
- **Form criticism**: Identifying original components versus later additions
- **Redaction criticism**: Tracing editorial processes and doctrinal development
- **Historical context**: Situating texts within ancient Indian religious and cultural frameworks

### Criteria for Earliness

Scholars use several criteria to evaluate the antiquity of texts:

- **Multiple attestation**: Material found across different sectarian collections
- **Linguistic features**: Archaic language forms
- **Doctrinal simplicity**: Less systematized presentations
- **Lack of sectarian markers**: Absence of later doctrinal disputes
- **Consistency with archeological evidence**: Alignment with verified historical contexts
- **Metrical analysis**: Verse structures indicating earlier composition

### Major Research Developments

Key advances in understanding early Buddhist texts:

- **19th-century text editions**: First critical editions of Pali texts
- **Early 20th century**: Comparative studies of Chinese Āgamas and Pali Nikāyas
- **Mid-20th century**: Analysis of Tibetan translations and Sanskrit fragments
- **1990s-present**: Discovery and analysis of Gāndhārī manuscripts
