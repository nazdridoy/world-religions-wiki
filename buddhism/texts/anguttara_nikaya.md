# Anguttara Nikaya: The Numerical Discourses

The Anguttara Nikaya ("Collection of Gradual Discourses" or "Numerical Discourses") is the fourth of the five nikayas (collections) in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon. Containing over 9,000 short suttas organized numerically from one to eleven, this extensive collection presents Buddhist teachings in a format designed to facilitate memorization and practical application.

## Historical Context

Like other parts of the Pali Canon, the Anguttara Nikaya was preserved through oral tradition before being committed to writing in Sri Lanka around the 1st century BCE. The collection's unique numerical organization format represents an important mnemonic innovation in the preservation of Buddhist teachings.

Evidence for the collection's antiquity includes:
- Linguistic patterns consistent with early Buddhist texts
- References to social and geographical contexts contemporary with the Buddha
- Parallel collections in other Buddhist schools, particularly the Chinese Ekottara Agama (增一阿含經)
- Consistency with core doctrinal elements found in other early Buddhist texts

The Anguttara Nikaya appears particularly designed for teaching practical aspects of the Buddhist path to both monastics and laypeople. Its numerical structure made it especially suitable for memorization in an oral tradition, while its practical focus made it relevant to everyday spiritual practice.
