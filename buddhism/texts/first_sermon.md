# The Buddha's First Sermon: Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta

The Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta ("Setting the Wheel of Dharma in Motion") records the Buddha's first formal teaching delivered shortly after his enlightenment. This discourse, given to five ascetics at the Deer Park in Sarnath near Varanasi, marks the beginning of the Buddha's teaching career and the establishment of Buddhism as a religious tradition.

## Historical Context

### Setting and Audience

The sermon was delivered to a specific audience with particular significance:

- **Time**: Traditionally dated around 528 BCE, several weeks after the Buddha's enlightenment
- **Location**: Isipatana (modern Sarnath), a deer sanctuary near Varanasi
- **Audience**: The five ascetics (pañcavaggiya bhikkhū) who had previously practiced austerities with the Buddha
  - Koṇḍañña
  - Bhaddiya
  - Vappa
  - Mahānāma
  - Assaji

These five had abandoned the Buddha when he gave up extreme asceticism, believing he had strayed from the path. The Buddha sought them out specifically to share his discovery.

### Archaeological Evidence

The historical significance of the first sermon is supported by archaeological findings:

- **Ashoka Pillar**: Emperor Ashoka (3rd century BCE) erected a commemorative pillar at Sarnath with his famous lion capital
- **Dhamek Stupa**: Built to mark the location of the first sermon
- **Ancient monasteries**: Archaeological remains of early Buddhist communities at Sarnath
- **Sculptural depictions**: Early Buddhist art frequently depicts the first sermon

## Content of the Sermon

### The Middle Way

The Buddha began by rejecting two extremes:

- **Self-indulgence** (kāmasukhallikānuyoga): The pursuit of sensual pleasures, rejected as "low, common, unprofitable and the way of ordinary people"
- **Self-mortification** (attakilamathānuyoga): Extreme ascetic practices, rejected as "painful, unworthy and unprofitable"

In contrast, the Buddha proposed the Middle Way (majjhima paṭipadā):
> "Avoiding both these extremes, the Tathagata has realized the Middle Path that gives vision and knowledge, leads to calm, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and Nibbana."

This Middle Way is identified with the Noble Eightfold Path.

### The Four Noble Truths

The central teaching of the sermon introduces the Four Noble Truths (cattāri ariyasaccāni):

1. **The Truth of Suffering** (dukkha sacca):
   > "Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair are suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not getting what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering."

2. **The Truth of the Origin of Suffering** (samudaya sacca):
   > "It is this craving which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking pleasure here and there; namely, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, craving for non-existence."

3. **The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering** (nirodha sacca):
   > "It is the complete fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it."

4. **The Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering** (magga sacca):
   > "It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration."

### The Three Phases of Knowledge

For each Noble Truth, the Buddha describes three phases of understanding, making twelve aspects (dvādasākāra) in total:

1. **Knowledge of the truth** (sacca-ñāṇa): Understanding what the truth is
2. **Knowledge of the task** (kicca-ñāṇa): Understanding what should be done with regard to this truth
3. **Knowledge of accomplishment** (kata-ñāṇa): Understanding that this task has been accomplished

For example, regarding the Truth of Suffering:
- Knowing "This is suffering"
- Knowing "This suffering should be fully understood"
- Knowing "This suffering has been fully understood"

### The Claim of Enlightenment

The sermon concludes with the Buddha's declaration of his enlightenment:

> "As long as my knowledge and vision regarding these Four Noble Truths as they really are in their three phases and twelve aspects was not thoroughly purified, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment... But when my knowledge and vision regarding these Four Noble Truths as they really are in their three phases and twelve aspects was thoroughly purified, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment."

## Immediate Impact

### The First Disciple

The traditional account indicates that Koṇḍañña was the first to understand the teaching:

> "And while this discourse was being spoken, there arose in the Venerable Koṇḍañña the dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma: 'Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.'"

The Buddha acknowledged this realization by exclaiming, "Koṇḍañña has indeed understood! Koṇḍañña has indeed understood!" (Aññāsi vata bho Koṇḍañño, aññāsi vata bho Koṇḍaññoti). This gave Koṇḍañña the title "Aññā Koṇḍañña" (Koṇḍañña who understands).

### Establishment of the Sangha

Following the sermon, the first Buddhist community was established:

- Koṇḍañña requested ordination, becoming the first bhikkhu (monk)
- Within days, all five ascetics had attained stream-entry (sotāpanna), the first stage of enlightenment
- Shortly thereafter, all five attained full enlightenment (arahantship)
- This formed the first Sangha (monastic community), completing the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha)

### Wheel Symbolism

The "setting in motion of the wheel of Dharma" metaphor has multiple meanings:

- **Royal symbolism**: The wheel (cakka/chakra) represents universal sovereignty, suggesting the Buddha's spiritual kingship
- **Completeness**: A wheel with all its parts represents the complete teaching
- **Irrevocability**: Once set in motion, the wheel cannot be stopped by religious or secular forces
- **Transmission**: The turning wheel conveys the teaching across the world
- **Cyclical nature**: The wheel that turns represents the recurring nature of the teaching throughout cosmic time
