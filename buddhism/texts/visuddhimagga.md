# Visuddhimagga: The Path of Purification

The Visuddhimagga (Pali: "Path of Purification") is one of the most influential texts in Theravada Buddhism, serving as a comprehensive manual of Buddhist doctrine and meditation practice. Composed in the 5th century CE by the renowned commentator Buddhaghosa, this monumental work systematically presents the entire path to liberation according to the Theravada tradition.

## Historical Context

### Authorship and Composition

The Visuddhimagga was written by Buddhaghosa, who is widely regarded as the most important commentator in the Theravada tradition:

- Buddhaghosa was an Indian monk who traveled to Sri Lanka around 430 CE
- According to tradition, he was born in North India near Bodh Gaya and was originally a Brahmin scholar
- He came to Sri Lanka to study the Sinhala commentaries preserved at the Mahavihara monastery in Anuradhapura
- He composed the Visuddhimagga to demonstrate his understanding before being allowed access to the commentarial literature
- After completing the Visuddhimagga, he went on to translate numerous Sinhala commentaries into Pali

The text was composed during a critical period in Buddhist history:
- The original teachings had been preserved orally and then in written form for many centuries
- Various interpretations and traditions had developed across different Buddhist communities
- There was a need to systematize the vast corpus of canonical and commentarial material
- Buddhism in India was evolving with the rise of Mahayana and later Vajrayana forms
- Sri Lanka was establishing itself as a stronghold of what would later be called Theravada Buddhism

### Significance in Buddhist History

The Visuddhimagga played a pivotal role in the development of Theravada Buddhism:

- It standardized doctrine and practice across the Theravada world
- It preserved and systematized older commentarial traditions that might otherwise have been lost
- It established a model for Buddhist scholasticism that influenced subsequent generations
- It provided a comprehensive reference for both theoretical understanding and practical application
- It helped distinguish the Theravada approach from other Buddhist schools developing at the time

The text continues to occupy a central position in Theravada Buddhism, second in authority only to the Pali Canon itself. It is studied in monasteries throughout Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, and has influenced modern Western understandings of Theravada Buddhism as well.

## Structure and Content

## The Seven Stages of Purification

The Visuddhimagga organizes the path to enlightenment through seven successive stages of purification (satta-visuddhi), a framework derived from the Rathavinita Sutta (MN 24):
