# Tibetan Buddhist Canon: Kangyur and Tengyur

The Tibetan Buddhist Canon comprises two vast collections of texts: the Kangyur (བཀའ་འགྱུར་, Wylie: *bka' 'gyur*), which contains the Buddha's words, and the Tengyur (བསྟན་འགྱུར་, Wylie: *bstan 'gyur*), which contains commentaries and treatises by Indian and Tibetan masters. Together, these collections represent one of Buddhism's most extensive and well-preserved scriptural traditions, forming the textual foundation for all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early Translations

The translation of Buddhist texts into Tibetan began in earnest during the 7th-9th centuries CE, during Tibet's Imperial Period:

- **King Songtsen Gampo** (7th century): Traditionally credited with introducing Buddhism to Tibet and commissioning the first translations
- **King Trisong Detsen** (742-797): Invited scholars like Śāntarakṣita and Padmasambhava to Tibet and established translation standards
- **First major translation period**: During this "early dissemination" (སྔ་དར་, *nga dar*), many sutras and tantras were translated from Sanskrit

During this period, the Tibetan script was developed specifically to facilitate precise translation of Sanskrit Buddhist texts. The Tibetan language was standardized to ensure consistency in translations.

### Imperial Standardization

Several key developments ensured translation quality:

- **Imperial edicts**: Regulated translation procedures and terminology
- **Creation of the Mahāvyutpatti**: Sanskrit-Tibetan lexicon with approximately 9,500 entries
- **Commission of translation teams**: Typically pairing an Indian paṇḍita with a Tibetan translator (ལོ་ཙཱ་བ་, *lotsāwa*)

### Dark Period and Revival

- **Fragmentation** (9th-10th centuries): Following the collapse of the Tibetan Empire, translation efforts declined
- **Second dissemination** (ཕྱི་དར་, *phyi dar*, 10th-13th centuries): New wave of translations under figures like Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055) and Atisha (982-1054)
- **Development of major monastic universities**: Centers like Sangphu, Sakya, and Narthang became hubs for text preservation

### Early Compilations

Before standardization, several regional collections emerged:

- **Narthang Kangyur** (early 14th century): One of the earliest compilations
- **Tshalpa Kangyur** (1347-1351): Another influential early collection

### Standardization Projects

Major canon-making projects include:

- **Old Narthang Tengyur** (13th century): Early compilation of commentarial literature
- **Buton Rinchen Drub's collection** (1290-1364): Buton organized and cataloged existing translations
- **Yongle Kangyur** (1410): Imperial Chinese-sponsored edition
- **Wanli Kangyur** (1605): Another Chinese imperial edition
- **Jang Satham** (17th century): Significant regional compilation
- **Derge Kangyur and Tengyur** (1733-1742): One of the most important and widely used editions
- **Choné Kangyur and Tengyur** (18th century): Major regional edition
- **Narthang Kangyur and Tengyur** (1730-1732): Modern redaction of the ancient collection
- **Lhasa Kangyur** (1934): One of the last traditionally produced editions

## Role in Tibetan Buddhism

### Study Traditions

The Tibetan Canon formed the basis for monastic education:

- **Geshe curriculum**: Systematic study of key texts over 15-20 years
- **Shedra education**: Monastic colleges organized around canonical texts
- **Debate practice**: Analytical discussion of canonical content
- **Commentarial tradition**: Generation of new commentaries on canonical texts

### Ritual Usage

Canonical texts serve important ritual functions:

- **Recitation practices**: Many texts recited as spiritual practices
- **Empowerment ceremonies**: Tantric initiation based on canonical texts
- **Daily liturgy**: Prayers and practices derived from canonical sources
- **Merit-making**: Sponsorship of text printing and recitation

### Different Sectarian Approaches

While all Tibetan Buddhist schools use the same basic canon, they emphasize different portions:

- **Nyingma** (རྙིང་མ་): Greater emphasis on early translations and tantras
- **Kagyu** (བཀའ་བརྒྱུད་): Focus on Mahāmudrā texts and selected tantras
- **Sakya** (ས་སྐྱ་): Emphasis on epistemological treatises and Hevajra Tantra
- **Gelug** (དགེ་ལུགས་): Systematic study of Indian treatises, especially Madhyamaka

### The "Fifth Section": Indigenous Tibetan Literature

Beyond the formal canon, each school developed its own collection of texts:

- **Revealed treasures** (གཏེར་མ་, *gter ma*): Especially in the Nyingma tradition
- **Collections of songs** (མགུར་འབུམ་, *mgur 'bum*): Such as those by Milarepa
- **Instructions** (གདམས་ངག་, *gdams ngag*): Practice lineage instructions
- **Collected works** (གསུང་འབུམ་, *gsung 'bum*): Compositions of major Tibetan masters

These texts, while not part of the formal Kangyur or Tengyur, are often considered equally authoritative within their traditions.
