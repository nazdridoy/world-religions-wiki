# Abhidharmakosha: Treasury of Higher Knowledge

The Abhidharmakosha (Sanskrit: Abhidharmakośa-bhāṣya; Chinese: 阿毘達磨俱舍論, Āpídámó Jùshè Lùn; Tibetan: མངོན་པ་མཛོད།, Chos mngon pa'i mdzod) is one of the most influential works in Buddhist scholastic philosophy. Composed by Vasubandhu around the 4th-5th century CE, this masterpiece systematizes the complex abhidharma teachings of the Sarvastivada school while also incorporating critiques from a Sautrantika perspective.

## Historical Context

### Authorship and Composition

The Abhidharmakosha was composed by Vasubandhu, one of Buddhism's most brilliant philosophers:

- Born in Gandhara (modern Pakistan/Afghanistan) around 4th century CE
- Initially trained in Sarvastivada Abhidharma, later influenced by Sautrantika and eventually Yogacara views
- Composed the Abhidharmakosha in verse form (karika) with an auto-commentary (bhashya)
- The work represents his earlier thought, before his conversion to Mahayana Buddhism
- Later tradition holds that his brother Asanga converted him to Mahayana, after which he wrote Yogacara texts

The text was composed during a vibrant period of philosophical development in Indian Buddhism:

- The abhidharma systems of various early Buddhist schools had reached maturity
- Mahayana movements were gaining prominence
- Buddhist logical and epistemological traditions were developing
- Competing philosophical schools of Hinduism were flourishing
- Buddhism was being transmitted along the Silk Road to Central and East Asia

### Transmission and Influence

The Abhidharmakosha quickly became a foundational text:

- Translated into Chinese by Xuanzang in 651-654 CE after his famous journey to India
- Translated into Tibetan by Jinamitra and Fa Zang in the early 9th century
- Generated extensive commentarial literature in India, China, Tibet, and beyond
- Studied across sectarian boundaries, even by those who disagreed with its views
- Served as a standard reference work for Buddhist philosophy for over 1,500 years

The Sanskrit original was lost for centuries until portions were discovered in Tibet and in manuscript fragments from Central Asia in the early 20th century. However, the text was preserved in its entirety in Chinese and Tibetan translations.

## Key Philosophical Concepts

The Abhidharmakosha presents a comprehensive philosophical system centered on several key concepts:

### 1. Theory of Dharmas

The text analyzes all of reality into elementary factors called dharmas:

- Dharmas are the ultimate units of physical and mental existence
- The Abhidharmakosha recognizes 75 types of dharmas (compared to 100+ in earlier Sarvastivada texts)
- These dharmas are categorized as conditioned (samskrita) or unconditioned (asamskrita)
- Each dharma has a unique characteristic (svalakshana) and various general characteristics (samanya-lakshana)

### 2. Momentariness (Kshanikavada)

A fundamental principle of the text is that all conditioned phenomena are momentary:

- Every dharma exists for only a single moment before perishing
- Apparent continuity is actually a series of discrete moments
- This momentary nature is the basis of impermanence (anitya)
- The theory accounts for change while maintaining causal continuity

### 3. Sarvastivada vs. Sautrantika Views

Vasubandhu presents and often critiques the Sarvastivada position that "all exists" (sarvam asti):

- The Sarvastivada held that dharmas exist in all three times (past, present, future)
- Vasubandhu often favors the Sautrantika view that only present dharmas truly exist
- He presents four Sarvastivada theories about how dharmas exist in different times
- The text often reconciles these competing perspectives through subtle analysis

### 4. Theory of Causation

The Abhidharmakosha elaborates a sophisticated account of causality:

- Six causes (hetu): co-existent cause, simultaneous cause, homogeneous cause, universal cause, retributive cause, and efficient cause
- Four conditions (pratyaya): causal condition, immediate condition, objective condition, and dominant condition
- Five effects (phala): ripened effect, compatible effect, separative effect, collective effect, and developmental effect

### 5. Atomistic Theory

The text presents an atomistic theory of matter:

- Physical reality is composed of subtle atomic particles (paramanu)
- These atoms form aggregations but never actually touch
- Atoms themselves are not directly perceptible, only their aggregations
- Different sensory qualities arise from different combinations of elemental types

### 6. Mind and Mental Factors

The Abhidharmakosha offers a detailed analysis of consciousness:

- Consciousness (citta) and mental factors (caitasika) arise together but have distinct functions
- 46 mental factors are enumerated and classified as universal, object-determined, wholesome, afflicted, or indeterminate
- The text analyzes how these mental factors combine in different states of mind
- Six types of consciousness correspond to the six sense bases

## Philosophical Significance

### Ontological Framework

The Abhidharmakosha presents a sophisticated ontology:

- Rejects both substantialism (eternalism) and nihilism
- Offers a middle way through a dynamic model of momentary phenomena
- Analyzes conventional reality into its ultimate constituents
- Maintains the principle of dependent origination while providing a detailed account of causal mechanics

### Theory of Knowledge

Vasubandhu develops an important epistemological framework:

- Distinguishes between direct perception and inference
- Analyzes the relationship between consciousness and its objects
- Establishes the valid means of knowledge (pramana)
- Distinguishes conventional truth (samvriti-satya) from ultimate truth (paramartha-satya)

### Psychological Analysis

The text provides a comprehensive account of mental processes:

- Analyzes the mechanics of cognition and misperception
- Explains how afflictions arise and how they can be eliminated
- Maps the relationship between cognitive and affective aspects of experience
- Presents a systematic model of the developmental stages of consciousness

### Soteriological Purpose

Despite its philosophical complexity, the Abhidharmakosha remains focused on liberation:

- All analysis serves the purpose of understanding suffering and its cessation
- The detailed mapping of mental factors helps identify what must be cultivated or abandoned
- The path structure provides a roadmap for spiritual development
- The analysis of momentariness reinforces the understanding of impermanence
