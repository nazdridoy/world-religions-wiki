## Literary Features

### Poetic Style

The Dhammapada employs several literary techniques:

- **Concise meter**: Typically four-line verses in simple meters for easy memorization

- **Gnomic wisdom**: Pithy sayings with universal application
- **Repetition**: Key phrases and concepts reiterated for emphasis

### Narrative Elements

The traditional commentaries (Dhammapada Atthakatha) later provided narrative frameworks for many verses, explaining the circumstances in which the Buddha supposedly uttered them.
