# Chinese Buddhist Canon (Dàzàngjīng)

The Chinese Buddhist Canon, called *Dàzàngjīng* (大藏經, "Great Treasury of Sutras"), represents one of the most extensive collections of Buddhist texts in the world. Developed over nearly two millennia, it contains translations of Indian texts as well as indigenous Chinese Buddhist works. This vast corpus has served as the scriptural foundation for Buddhism throughout East Asia, fundamentally shaping the development of Buddhist traditions in China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.

## Historical Development

### Early Translation Efforts (1st-4th centuries CE)

Buddhist texts began arriving in China via the Silk Road around the 1st century CE:

- **An Shigao** (安世高, 2nd century): Parthian monk who translated early meditation texts
- **Lokakṣema** (支婁迦讖, 2nd century): Translated early Mahayana sutras
- **Dharmarakṣa** (竺法護, 3rd century): Prolific translator of Mahayana texts including an early version of the Lotus Sutra
- **Faxian** (法顯, 337-422): Traveled to India and brought back important Vinaya texts

These early translations were often rough and inconsistent in terminology, reflecting the challenges of rendering Indian Buddhist concepts in Chinese.

### The Golden Age of Translation (5th-7th centuries)

Translation methodologies improved significantly during this period:

- **Kumārajīva** (鳩摩羅什, 344-413): Revolutionized translation methods and produced highly influential versions of major Mahayana texts
- **Xuanzang** (玄奘, 602-664): Traveled to India for 17 years, brought back hundreds of Sanskrit texts, and established rigorous translation standards
- **Yijing** (義淨, 635-713): Focused on translating Vinaya and Abhidharma texts after his journey to India

During this period, imperial support for translation projects was strong, with large teams of specialists working on translations.

### Compilation of Catalogs

To organize the growing number of texts, scholar-monks compiled catalogs:

- **Daoan's** (道安) catalog (374 CE): Early attempt to organize and authenticate translations
- **Sengyou's** (僧祐) *Chu sanzang jiji* (出三藏記集, 515 CE): Comprehensive catalog of translations
- **Zhisheng's** (智昇) *Kaiyuan Catalog* (開元釋教錄, 730 CE): Listed 2,278 texts in 7,046 fascicles

These catalogs helped distinguish authentic translations from apocryphal texts and organized works by category.

### Formation of Printed Canons

The Chinese were pioneers in printing technology, which they applied to preserving Buddhist texts:

- **Kaibao Canon** (開寶藏, 971-983): First complete printed edition using woodblocks, commissioned by the Song Dynasty
- **Khitan Canon** (契丹藏, 11th century): Produced by the Liao Dynasty
- **Koryo Canon** (高麗藏, 1011-1087, revised 1237-1251): Korean edition that preserved many texts lost in China
- **Zhaocheng Canon** (趙城藏, 1149-1162): Jin Dynasty edition
- **Jiaxing Canon** (嘉興藏, 1589-1677): Ming Dynasty edition, widely distributed in Japan

### Modern Collections

Several modern editions continue to serve as reference standards:

- **Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō** (大正新修大藏經, 1924-1934): The most widely used modern edition, compiled in Japan
- **Zhonghua Dazangjing** (中華大藏經, 1984-present): Modern Chinese edition
- **CBETA** (Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association): Digital version of the Taishō edition with additions

## Structure and Organization

### Traditional Classification

The Chinese Buddhist Canon is traditionally organized into three "baskets" (三藏, sānzàng) based on the Indian Tripitaka model:

1. **Sūtra** (經, jīng): Discourses attributed to the Buddha
2. **Vinaya** (律, lǜ): Monastic rules and regulations
3. **Abhidharma** (論, lùn): Scholastic treatises and commentaries

However, the Chinese Canon expanded beyond this framework to include indigenous Chinese compositions and esoteric works.

### Taishō Organization

The Taishō edition, which has become the standard reference, organizes texts into the following sections:

1. **Āgamas** (Sections 1-4): Early Buddhist sutras roughly corresponding to the Pali Nikāyas
2. **Mahāyāna Sūtras** (Sections 5-21): Organized by themes and schools
3. **Vinaya** (Sections 22-24): Monastic codes from various schools
4. **Abhidharma** (Sections 25-29): Scholastic treatises of various schools
5. **Madhyamaka, Yogācāra, and other Indian commentarial literature** (Sections 30-31)
6. **Chinese Sectarian Writings** (Sections 32-54): Works by Chinese Buddhist schools
7. **Encyclopedias, Histories, and Catalogs** (Sections 55-61)
8. **Non-canonical works** (Sections 62-85): Including apocryphal texts and works from other traditions

The Taishō contains 2,184 texts in 85 volumes, plus 12 volumes of iconography and 3 volumes of catalogs.
