# Majjhima Nikaya: The Middle Length Discourses

The Majjhima Nikaya, or "Collection of Middle-Length Discourses," is one of the five nikayas (collections) that constitute the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon, the core scriptures of Theravada Buddhism. Comprising 152 suttas (discourses) attributed to the Buddha and his chief disciples, the Majjhima Nikaya contains some of Buddhism's most important teachings, presented in a format of moderate length—neither too brief nor too extensive.

## Historical Context

### Origin and Compilation

The suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya are believed to have been delivered during the Buddha's 45-year teaching career in northeastern India during the 5th century BCE. The collection as we know it today underwent several stages of development:

- Initially preserved through oral transmission by specialized groups of monks who memorized specific portions
- Formalized at the First Buddhist Council, held shortly after the Buddha's death (parinibbana)
- Further systematized at subsequent councils, particularly the Third Buddhist Council under Emperor Ashoka (c. 250 BCE)
- Committed to writing in Sri Lanka around 29 BCE during the Fourth Buddhist Council
- Preserved primarily in the Pali language, though parallel versions exist in Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan translations

The collection represents one of the earliest strata of Buddhist literature, though scholars recognize that the texts were refined and standardized over several centuries through the oral tradition before being written down.

### Authenticity and Dating

Scholarly perspectives on the Majjhima Nikaya include:

- **Conservative View**: The collection largely preserves the actual words of the Buddha, with minimal later additions
- **Critical View**: While based on authentic teachings, the texts underwent significant editorial processes over several centuries
- **Comparative Studies**: Comparison with Chinese Agamas and other parallel traditions reveals both striking similarities in core content and variations in arrangement and details

Modern textual analysis suggests that some suttas may be later compositions, as they display more developed philosophical concepts or literary styles. However, most scholars agree that the collection contains material dating to the earliest period of Buddhism, preserving core doctrinal elements that formed the foundation of all later Buddhist traditions.

## Structure and Organization

The Majjhima Nikaya contains 152 suttas organized into three divisions (vaggas) of 50 suttas each (the third division has 52 suttas):

### 1. Mūlapaṇṇāsa (The Root Fifty)
- **Mūlapariyāya Vagga** (The Root of All Things): Suttas 1-10
- **Sīhanāda Vagga** (The Lion's Roar): Suttas 11-20
- **Tatiya Vagga** (The Third): Suttas 21-30
- **Mahāyamaka Vagga** (The Great Pair): Suttas 31-40
- **Cūḷayamaka Vagga** (The Lesser Pair): Suttas 41-50

### 2. Majjhimapaṇṇāsa (The Middle Fifty)
- **Gahapati Vagga** (The Householders): Suttas 51-60
- **Bhikkhu Vagga** (The Monks): Suttas 61-70
- **Paribbājaka Vagga** (The Wanderers): Suttas 71-80
- **Rāja Vagga** (The Kings): Suttas 81-90
- **Brāhmaṇa Vagga** (The Brahmins): Suttas 91-100

### 3. Uparipaṇṇāsa (The Final Fifty-Two)
- **Devadaha Vagga**: Suttas 101-110
- **Anupada Vagga**: Suttas 111-120
- **Suññata Vagga** (The Void): Suttas 121-130
- **Vibhaṅga Vagga** (The Expositions): Suttas 131-142
- **Saḷāyatana Vagga** (The Six Sense Bases): Suttas 143-152

This organizational structure appears to be primarily thematic, with suttas grouped according to subject matter, audience, or teaching style, rather than chronologically or by length.
