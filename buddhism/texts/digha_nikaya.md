# Digha Nikaya: The Collection of Long Discourses

The Digha Nikaya ("Long Collection") is the first of the five nikayas (collections) in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon. It consists of 34 suttas (discourses) attributed to the Buddha and his close disciples, distinguished by their greater length compared to discourses in other collections.

## Historical Context

The Digha Nikaya represents one of the oldest strata of Buddhist texts, likely compiled within the first century after the Buddha's death (parinirvana). While oral transmission preceded written documentation, the collection achieved its current form around the 1st century BCE when the Pali Canon was first committed to writing in Sri Lanka.

Several factors suggest the Digha Nikaya's early origin:
- Its language and style match the oldest portions of the Pali Canon
- Many discourses describe social and political conditions of North India during the Buddha's lifetime
- The collection contains detailed accounts of the Buddha's final days, suggesting composition shortly after his death
- Parallel versions exist in other early Buddhist schools (especially in the Chinese Agamas)

The Digha Nikaya appears to have been designed partly as an introductory collection for newcomers and for presenting Buddhism to non-Buddhists, especially brahmins, nobles, and kings. Many discourses directly address contemporary religious and philosophical views.

## Structure and Content

The Digha Nikaya is divided into three sections (vaggas):

- The most detailed account of the Buddha's passing (Mahaparinibbana Sutta)

### Liturgical and Ceremonial Use
Certain suttas from the Digha Nikaya are regularly recited for protection and blessing, particularly:

## Translation and Transmission

### Early Translations
The Digha Nikaya was first translated into Western languages in the late 19th century:
- T.W. Rhys Davids produced the pioneering English translation "Dialogues of the Buddha" (1899-1921)
- Other early translations appeared in German and French

### Modern Translations
Contemporary translations include:
- Maurice Walshe's "The Long Discourses of the Buddha" (1987, 1995)
- Bhikkhu Bodhi's selections in "In the Buddha's Words" (2005)
- Numerous translations of individual suttas by various scholars and monastics

### Parallels in Other Buddhist Canons
Many Digha Nikaya suttas have parallels in other early Buddhist collections:
- The Chinese Dirgha Agama (長阿含經, Chang Ahan Jing)
- Sanskrit fragments from Central Asia
- Quotations in later Buddhist literature

These parallels allow scholars to compare different transmissions of the same discourses, providing insight into early Buddhism before sectarian divisions.

## Study and Practice

### Academic Study
The Digha Nikaya is studied by scholars for:
- Understanding early Buddhist doctrine
- Insights into ancient Indian society and religion
- Linguistic analysis of early Pali
- Comparative study with other early Buddhist texts
- Tracing the historical development of Buddhism

### Meditation Practice
Several suttas serve as central texts for meditation practice:
- Mahasatipatthana Sutta is fundamental to vipassana (insight) meditation

### Contemporary Relevance
Modern Buddhists and scholars highlight several aspects of the Digha Nikaya as particularly relevant today:
