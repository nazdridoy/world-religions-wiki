# Buddhism

Buddhism is one of the world's major religions, founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in northeastern India during the 5th century BCE. Unlike many other religions, Buddhism does not focus on the relationship between humanity and God. Instead, it is centered on personal spiritual development and the attainment of deep insight into the true nature of life.

## Origins and Development

Buddhism originated in ancient India when Siddhartha Gautama, a prince from the Shakya clan in what is now Nepal, achieved enlightenment after years of spiritual seeking. The religion spread throughout Asia over the subsequent centuries, developing distinct traditions as it adapted to different cultural contexts.

## Core Beliefs

At the heart of Buddhist teaching are the Four Noble Truths:
1. The truth of suffering (dukkha)
2. The truth of the cause of suffering (samudaya)
3. The truth of the end of suffering (nirodha)
4. The truth of the path leading to the end of suffering (magga)

Buddhism teaches that through understanding these truths and following the Eightfold Path, individuals can overcome suffering and achieve nirvanaâ€”a state of liberation and freedom from the cycle of rebirth.

## Main Traditions

Buddhism has evolved into several major traditions:

- **Theravada** ("Way of the Elders") - Predominant in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos
- **Mahayana** ("Great Vehicle") - Prevalent in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam
- **Vajrayana** ("Diamond Vehicle") - Most common in Tibet, Mongolia, and parts of India and Nepal
