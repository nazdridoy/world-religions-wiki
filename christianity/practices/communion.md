# Holy Communion: The Lord's Supper

![Communion elements with bread and wine](communion_image.jpg)

Holy Communion (also called the Lord's Supper, the Eucharist, or the Breaking of Bread) stands as one of Christianity's most sacred and universal sacramentsâ€”a ritual meal instituted by Jesus Christ during his Last Supper with his disciples. This practice forms the cornerstone of Christian worship across denominations, though theological interpretations and ritual expressions vary widely. Through the sharing of bread and wine (or grape juice), believers commemorate Christ's sacrificial death, experience his spiritual presence, express church unity, and anticipate the heavenly banquet. As a living embodiment of faith, Communion provides Christians with a tangible connection to Christ and each other, serving as both a profound spiritual experience and a visible sign of Christian identity throughout history and across the global church.

## Theological Understandings

### Major Interpretive Traditions
- **Transubstantiation (Roman Catholic)**: 
  - Bread and wine substantially become Christ's body and blood
  - Accidents (appearance, taste) remain unchanged
  - Christ fully present in each element
  - Requires priestly consecration

- **Consubstantiation (Lutheran)**:
  - Christ's body and blood present "in, with, and under" the elements
  - Bread and wine remain unchanged but Christ truly present
  - Real presence without physical transformation
  - Mystery emphasized over philosophical explanation

- **Spiritual Presence (Reformed/Presbyterian)**:
  - Christ spiritually but truly present to the faithful
  - Bread and wine remain symbols
  - Holy Spirit mediates Christ's presence
  - Faith required for true reception

  - Bread and wine as symbols or reminders
