# Orthodox Practices: Byzantine Traditions

![Orthodox Divine Liturgy with priest and icons](orthodox_image.jpg)

Orthodox Christianity preserves ancient liturgical, theological, and spiritual traditions dating back to the Byzantine Empire and early church. Distinguished by its emphasis on mystical encounter with God, elaborate liturgical worship, veneration of icons, and ascetic disciplines, Orthodox Christianity maintains a distinctive approach to faith that differs significantly from Western Christian expressions. The Orthodox tradition views worship and practice as inherently theological, with doctrines expressed through liturgy, iconography, and lived spirituality rather than systematic theological statements. Centered on the concept of theosis (deification)—the process of human beings becoming participants in divine nature through grace—Orthodox practices aim to transform believers through encounter with divine mysteries. With approximately 300 million adherents worldwide, primarily in Eastern Europe, Russia, Greece, the Middle East, and growing communities throughout the global diaspora, Orthodox Christianity offers a rich treasury of spiritual wisdom and aesthetic beauty through its distinctive practices, many of which have remained remarkably consistent since ancient times.
