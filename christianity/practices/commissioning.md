# Commissioning Services in Christianity

![Church commissioning ceremony with hands raised in blessing](commissioning_service.jpg)

Commissioning services in Christianity represent formal rituals where individuals are publicly set apart and authorized for specific ministry roles or mission work. These ceremonies acknowledge divine calling, confer community authorization, and mark significant spiritual transitions. Unlike ordination (which typically involves permanent clergy status), commissioning often focuses on specific, sometimes temporary, ministry assignmentsâ€”whether as missionaries, lay leaders, ministry directors, program coordinators, or for special service projects. Through scripture readings, prayer, symbolic actions, testimonies, and community affirmation, commissioning services create sacred space for publicly recognizing spiritual giftedness and establishing accountability relationships between those sent and the sending community. These ceremonies provide crucial spiritual and emotional preparation for challenging ministry work while strengthening the church's identity as a missional community.
