# Healing Services: Christian Practices of Divine Restoration

![Christian healing service with prayer and laying on of hands](healing_service_image.jpg)

Healing services represent a distinctive Christian liturgical and pastoral practice centered on the belief in God's power and willingness to restore physical, emotional, spiritual, and relational wholeness through prayer, sacramental actions, and communal support. While approaches to healing ministry vary dramatically across Christian traditions—from charismatic services featuring dramatic manifestations to contemplative healing prayers integrated within traditional liturgies—these practices universally express the Christian conviction that God's redemptive work in Christ extends to the restoration of the whole person. Drawing on biblical accounts of Jesus's healing ministry and apostolic practices, contemporary healing services typically incorporate scripture reading, confession, intercessory prayer, anointing with oil, and the laying on of hands, often within a eucharistic context that connects physical healing with spiritual wholeness. Though theological interpretations differ regarding the relationship between faith, divine sovereignty, and healing outcomes, these services provide spaces where suffering individuals encounter compassionate community, experience God's presence amid affliction, and participate in a witness to the Christian hope that ultimately all creation will be restored in what Scripture calls "the healing of the nations."
