# Infant Dedication

Infant dedication is a ceremonial practice in many Protestant Christian denominations where parents present their child before the congregation in a public commitment to raise them in the Christian faith. Unlike infant baptism, dedication does not involve water or sacramental theology, but rather emphasizes parental responsibility, congregational support, and divine blessing on the child's spiritual journey. This practice is especially prominent in evangelical, Baptist, Pentecostal, and non-denominational churches that hold to believers' baptism theology. The ceremony typically includes pastoral blessing, parental vows, congregational pledges of support, prayer for the child's spiritual development, and sometimes symbolic elements such as certificates or candles. While theological particulars vary across traditions, infant dedication fundamentally represents a commitment to nurture the child spiritually until they can make their own faith decision, underscoring the community's role in faith formation and the family as the primary context for spiritual development.
