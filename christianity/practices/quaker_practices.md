# Quaker Practices: The Religious Society of Friends

![Quaker meeting for worship](quaker_practices_image.jpg)

The Religious Society of Friends, commonly known as Quakers, embodies a distinctive approach to Christian spirituality characterized by simplicity, pacifism, equality, and direct spiritual experience. Founded in mid-17th century England by George Fox, Quakerism emerged as a radical Protestant movement that rejected elaborate rituals, paid clergy, and hierarchical church structures in favor of an unmediated relationship with the Divine. Central to Quaker practice is the belief in the "Inner Light" or "that of God in everyone"â€”the conviction that each person has direct access to spiritual truth through the indwelling presence of God. This theological foundation shapes their unique worship style, decision-making processes, ethical commitments, and social witness. While representing a relatively small religious community of approximately 380,000 worldwide members, Quakers have exerted outsized historical influence through their pioneering work in social justice movements, including abolition, women's rights, prison reform, and peace activism. Today's Quakerism encompasses diverse expressions ranging from programmed, pastor-led meetings influenced by evangelical Christianity to unprogrammed meetings maintaining the traditional silent worship practice, united by shared testimonies of simplicity, peace, integrity, community, equality, and stewardship (often remembered by the acronym SPICES).
