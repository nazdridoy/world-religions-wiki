# Small Groups: Christian Fellowship in Community

![Small group gathered in a home](small_groups_image.jpg)

Small groups represent a fundamental expression of Christian communityâ€”gatherings of believers in intimate settings for fellowship, study, prayer, accountability, and spiritual growth. Typically consisting of 3-15 people meeting regularly in homes, coffee shops, church facilities, or online spaces, these groups create relational environments where faith can be lived out alongside others in meaningful ways. While the specific format, structure, and focus may vary significantly across denominations and traditions, small groups share a common purpose: to foster deeper connection with God and other believers through intentional relationships. Despite their contemporary popularity, small groups have ancient roots that stretch back to the earliest Christian communities, offering modern believers a participatory expression of communal faith that complements larger corporate worship and provides a context for spiritual transformation through shared life and practice.
