# Simplicity: Christian Practice of Intentional Living

![Simple wooden table with Bible and candle](simplicity_image.jpg)

Christian simplicity represents a spiritual discipline and counterculture witness through which believers intentionally reorient their relationship with material possessions, time commitments, and lifestyle choices to better align with kingdom values and spiritual priorities. While differing from asceticism's focus on deprivation, simplicity seeks appropriate stewardship and right-ordered living that creates space for deeper spirituality and mission engagement. This practice manifests in both internal attitudes and external choicesâ€”addressing consumption patterns, environmental impact, and economic habits while cultivating contentment, freedom, and presence. As practitioners deliberately limit their material needs and organizational commitments, they create margin for generosity, relationship investment, creation care, and contemplative presence. Though historically emphasized in monastic traditions and renewal movements, contemporary simplicity expressions have gained renewed relevance across denominational lines as a prophetic response to consumer culture, digital overload, and environmental concerns. While interpretations vary in strictness and application, simplicity ultimately functions as a holistic practice through which Christians embody Jesus' teachings regarding wealth, seek freedom from cultural captivity, and demonstrate alternative values consistent with their eschatological hope.
