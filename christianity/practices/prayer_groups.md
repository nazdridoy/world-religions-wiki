# Prayer Groups: Corporate Prayer Gatherings

![Circle of Christians praying together](prayer_groups_image.jpg)

Prayer groups represent one of Christianity's most enduring and universal communal practicesâ€”gatherings where believers join together specifically for shared prayer. These intentional communities of intercession and spiritual support exist across denominations and cultures, taking diverse forms from formal church prayer ministries to informal home gatherings. Through united petition, thanksgiving, confession, and listening prayer, participants experience deepened spiritual connection, mutual encouragement, and a tangible sense of Christ's presence "where two or three are gathered." As both ancient tradition and adaptable contemporary practice, prayer groups continue to serve as spiritual powerhouses within Christian communities, fostering corporate faith expression, building relational bonds, providing personal support, and advancing kingdom purposes through unified spiritual engagement.
