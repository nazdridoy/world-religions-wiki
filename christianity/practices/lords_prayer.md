![Person praying with hands folded](lords_prayer_image.jpg)

The Lord's Prayer, also known as the "Our Father" or "Pater Noster," stands as the central prayer in Christianity, taught by Jesus himself to his disciples. Recorded in the Gospels of Matthew (6:9-13) and Luke (11:2-4), this prayer provides both a pattern for Christian prayer and a profound theological statement about God's nature and humanity's relationship with the divine. Across all Christian traditions, the Lord's Prayer serves as a unifying text that embodies core Christian beliefs while offering a practical template for daily communication with God.
