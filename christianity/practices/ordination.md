# Ordination: Setting Apart for Sacred Service

![Ordination ceremony with laying on of hands](ordination_image.jpg)

Ordination—the formal setting apart of individuals for religious leadership—represents one of Christianity's most significant institutional practices. Through this ritual, communities recognize, authorize, and commission persons for specific ministerial roles and responsibilities. While ordination practices vary widely across traditions—from elaborate episcopal consecrations with apostolic succession claims to simple congregational affirmations—all reflect theological convictions about how God calls and equips leaders for church service. The practice embodies the tension between divine calling and human recognition, institutional authority and spiritual empowerment, traditional forms and contemporary needs. Ordination confers both privilege and responsibility, establishing leaders who serve as shepherds, teachers, sacramental ministers, and community representatives. As Christianity continues to evolve globally, ordination practices likewise adapt while maintaining their essential function of establishing recognized spiritual leadership within the Body of Christ.
