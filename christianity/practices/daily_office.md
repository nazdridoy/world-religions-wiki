# Daily Office: Christian Practices of Fixed-Hour Prayer

![Monastic prayer books and bell](daily_office_image.jpg)

The Daily Office represents one of Christianity's most enduring prayer disciplines—a practice of sanctifying time through regular, structured prayer at fixed hours throughout the day. Rooted in ancient Jewish patterns of daily prayer and developed into a comprehensive system by early Christian monastic communities, the Daily Office (also known as the Liturgy of the Hours, Divine Office, or canonical hours) establishes a rhythm of prayer that intentionally interrupts ordinary activities to reorient believers toward divine presence and purpose. Unlike spontaneous or occasional prayer, the Office follows prescribed patterns of psalms, scripture readings, canticles, and prayers that connect the individual with the larger church's ongoing prayer across time and space. While monastic communities observe the full cycle of hours (traditionally seven or eight times daily), contemporary adaptations typically focus on morning and evening prayer (Lauds and Vespers), making this ancient practice increasingly accessible to Christians in all life circumstances. Through its cyclical engagement with scripture—particularly the Psalms—and its attention to the passing of time as sacred, the Daily Office offers practitioners a framework for integrating spiritual awareness into daily life while participating in the church's continuous offering of prayer and praise.
