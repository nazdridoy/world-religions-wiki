Holy Week marks the culmination of the Lenten season and commemorates the final days of Jesus Christ's earthly life, from his triumphal entry into Jerusalem through his passion, crucifixion, and burial. This most sacred period in the Christian calendar invites believers to journey alongside Christ through his suffering, creating a profound spiritual path that reaches its glorious resolution in Easter's resurrection celebration. Each day of Holy Week carries its own theological significance and distinctive liturgical observances across various Christian traditions. Through dramatic reenactments, solemn liturgies, and periods of reflective prayer, Christians worldwide participate in this annual remembrance that forms the narrative core of their faith. Holy Week's progression from acclaim to abandonment, from suffering to silence, creates the essential context for understanding the transformative joy of Easter morning.
