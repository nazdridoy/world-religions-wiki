# Social Justice: Christian Advocacy for Systemic Change

![People advocating for justice](social_justice_image.jpg)

Social justice within Christianity represents a theological and practical commitment to addressing systemic inequalities, oppressive structures, and institutionalized forms of injustice. Unlike individual acts of charity, which respond to immediate needs, social justice work focuses on transforming the underlying systems that create and perpetuate poverty, discrimination, environmental degradation, and other forms of structural sin. Rooted in biblical themes of God's preferential concern for the marginalized and prophetic calls for righteous societies, Christian social justice engagement has manifested throughout church history—from early church criticism of Roman social structures to medieval guilds' labor protections, from abolition movements to contemporary advocacy for economic, racial, and environmental justice. While theological traditions vary in their emphasis on social reform versus personal salvation, all major branches of Christianity recognize some imperative toward just social arrangements as an expression of gospel values. Modern Christian social justice work spans a spectrum from direct political engagement to alternative community formation, from targeted issue campaigns to comprehensive theological reimaginings of social and economic relationships—all seeking to realize aspects of God's kingdom values in present social structures.
