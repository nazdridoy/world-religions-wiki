# Christmas: Celebrating the Incarnation

![Christmas nativity scene with manger and star](christmas_nativity.jpg)

Christmas, celebrated annually on December 25th in Western Christianity (January 7th in many Eastern churches), commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ, a pivotal moment in Christian theology when "the Word became flesh" (John 1:14). This feast celebrates the Incarnation—God entering human history in the person of Jesus. While not the earliest Christian feast (Easter holds that distinction), Christmas has developed into one of Christianity's most widely observed celebrations, transcending religious boundaries to become a global cultural phenomenon. Through its rich tapestry of liturgical observances, theological reflections, family traditions, and cultural expressions, Christmas invites contemplation of divine love made manifest in human form and the profound mystery of Emmanuel, "God with us."
