Easter stands as Christianity's most important feast day and central celebration, commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day after his crucifixion. This foundational event represents the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan for humanity and constitutes the cornerstone of Christian faith. As the Apostle Paul wrote, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile" (1 Corinthians 15:17). Easter celebrates Christ's victory over sin and death, offering believers the promise of eternal life and spiritual renewal. The joyful proclamation "Christ is risen!" echoes throughout Christian communities worldwide, transcending denominational boundaries and cultural contexts as the universal expression of Christianity's central hope.
