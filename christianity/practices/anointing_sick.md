# Anointing of the Sick: Christian Practices of Healing Prayer

![Minister anointing sick person with oil](anointing_sick_image.jpg)

Anointing of the sick represents one of Christianity's most ancient healing practicesâ€”a sacred ritual in which consecrated oil becomes the tangible medium for divine grace and healing touch amid physical suffering. While often associated primarily with Catholic and Orthodox traditions as a sacrament, forms of prayer with anointing oil for healing appear across virtually all Christian denominations, rooted in biblical directives from the letter of James. Whether understood as a formal sacrament that imparts spiritual grace or as a faith-filled symbolic act that accompanies fervent prayer, anointing expresses the church's embodied commitment to holistic care for those in physical distress. The practice has evolved significantly throughout church history, from its early application for various illnesses to the medieval narrowing as "extreme unction" (last rites) and its contemporary recovery as ministry to the sick rather than exclusively to the dying. In its theological essence, anointing of the sick demonstrates the church's conviction that physical suffering remains within God's redemptive concern, that touch and material elements can serve as channels of divine presence, and that the community of faith bears responsibility to extend Christ's healing ministry through tangible acts of compassionate care for those experiencing illness, injury, or the infirmities of aging.
