# Tithing: Christian Stewardship and Giving

![Person placing offering in collection plate](tithing_image.jpg)

Tithing represents one of Christianity's most enduring financial disciplinesâ€”the practice of giving a portion of one's income to support religious work, ministries, and those in need. While often associated with the specific proportion of ten percent, drawn from its linguistic root meaning "tenth," contemporary Christian tithing encompasses diverse theological interpretations and practical applications across denominations. Moving beyond mere monetary transactions, tithing embodies spiritual principles of gratitude, trust, stewardship, and kingdom participation. As believers redirect portions of their financial resources to church and charitable causes, they engage in a countercultural economic practice that acknowledges God's ultimate ownership, expresses faith in divine provision, supports communal religious life, and participates in addressing human need. Though practiced with varying degrees of obligation or freedom depending on theological tradition, tithing continues to function as a formative spiritual discipline through which Christians order their material resources according to spiritual priorities.
