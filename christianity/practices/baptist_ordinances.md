# Baptist Ordinances: Believer's Baptism and the Lord's Supper

![Baptist baptism by immersion](baptist_ordinances_image.jpg)

Baptist ordinances represent distinctive ritual practices that characterize the Baptist tradition within Protestant Christianity, most notably believer's baptism by full immersion and the Lord's Supper as a memorial observance. Unlike denominations that recognize multiple sacraments, Baptists typically maintain these two practices as "ordinances"—symbolic acts commanded by Christ rather than channels of divine grace. This theological distinction emphasizes the memorial and obediential nature of these practices rather than attributing to them any inherent spiritual efficacy. Emerging from their Anabaptist and Separatist roots, Baptists have historically insisted on the necessity of personal faith prior to baptism, rejecting infant baptism in favor of the immersion of professing believers. Similarly, Baptist observance of communion generally emphasizes remembrance and proclamation of Christ's sacrificial death rather than a mystical presence in the elements. While specific baptismal and communion practices may vary somewhat among Baptist congregations—from Southern Baptist to American Baptist, Primitive to Progressive—these ordinances remain foundational expressions of Baptist ecclesiology, with their observance both delineating church membership boundaries and embodying core theological convictions about the nature of faith, church, and discipleship.
