# The Eucharist: The Lord's Supper

![Communion elements on altar table](eucharist_image.jpg)

The Eucharist (also called Holy Communion, the Lord's Supper, or Divine Liturgy) stands as Christianity's central sacramental celebrationâ€”a ritual meal instituted by Jesus Christ during his Last Supper with his disciples. Across all major Christian traditions, this practice remains foundational to Christian worship and identity, though theological understandings and ritual forms vary widely. Through the sharing of bread and wine, Christians commemorate Christ's sacrificial death, experience his spiritual presence, express church unity, anticipate the heavenly banquet, and participate in the mystery of salvation. As a living embodiment of faith, the Eucharist continues to provide contemporary Christians with a tangible connection to Christ and each other, serving as both a profound spiritual experience and a visible sign of Christian identity throughout the world.
