# Creation Care

![Christians planting trees as environmental stewardship](creation_care.jpg)

Creation care refers to the Christian practice of environmental stewardship, rooted in the biblical mandate to tend and keep God's creation. This theological and ethical framework views humans not as owners but as caretakers of the natural world, responsible to God for its protection and flourishing. Emerging as a distinct emphasis in late 20th-century Christianity across denominational lines, creation care integrates biblical exegesis, theological reflection, scientific understanding, and practical action toward ecological sustainability. Practitioners engage in both individual lifestyle changes and collective advocacy for environmental policies that reflect divine values of justice, sustainability, and care for the vulnerable. While practical applications vary widely from energy conservation to habitat restoration, the core theological conviction remains consistent: that honoring the Creator involves responsible stewardship of creation, and that environmental degradation represents both ecological crisis and spiritual failure. Creation care thus serves as a holistic expression of Christian discipleship, connecting worship of the Creator with tangible care for creation.
