# Fasting: Christian Abstinence as Spiritual Discipline

![Person praying during a fast](fasting_image.jpg)

Fasting—the voluntary abstention from food, drink, or other pleasures for spiritual purposes—stands as one of Christianity's most ancient and transformative spiritual disciplines. While practiced across religious traditions, Christian fasting carries distinctive theological meanings rooted in biblical narratives, Christ's example, and centuries of church tradition. Unlike mere dieting, Christian fasting integrates physical abstention with prayer, scripture engagement, and spiritual intention. Across diverse denominations and throughout Christian history, fasting has served multiple spiritual functions: heightening prayer effectiveness, facilitating spiritual discernment, expressing penitence, breaking unhealthy attachments, preparing for sacramental participation, and developing solidarity with those in need. Though its practice has fluctuated through centuries—from rigorous medieval observances to modern simplifications or neglect—fasting continues to offer believers a countercultural discipline that challenges material excess, deepens spiritual awareness, and embodies the Christian understanding that humans are integrated beings whose physical practices impact spiritual formation.
