# Foot Washing: Christian Practices of Humble Service

![People participating in foot washing ceremony](foot_washing_image.jpg)

Foot washing represents one of Christianity's most profound yet often overlooked ritual practices—a symbolic act of humble service that directly reenacts Jesus's example with his disciples at the Last Supper. While less universally practiced than baptism or communion, this ceremonial washing of another's feet offers a powerful tactile expression of Christian servanthood, mutual vulnerability, and the inversion of social hierarchies that characterizes Jesus's kingdom vision. Though interpretations vary across denominational lines—from sacramental understanding to symbolic teaching tool—foot washing consistently embodies the Christian paradox that true leadership manifests in service, and genuine greatness emerges through humility. The practice holds particular significance in Anabaptist, Mennonite, Brethren, and certain Baptist traditions, where it may be observed as a regular ordinance, while in Catholic, Orthodox, and many mainline Protestant churches, it typically appears in Holy Thursday liturgies commemorating Jesus's Last Supper actions. In its contemporary expressions, foot washing continues to challenge cultural norms of power, status, and physical boundaries while offering participants a visceral encounter with the countercultural ethics of Jesus's command to "wash one another's feet" as he washed theirs—a ritual that transforms abstract theological concepts of servanthood and equality into embodied, interpersonal experience.
