# Liberation Theology Texts - Latin American Perspective

![Liberation theology gathering](liberation_theology_image.jpg)

Liberation theology texts constitute a body of influential theological literature that emerged primarily from Latin America in the mid-20th century, emphasizing Christianity's commitment to social justice, political liberation, and preferential treatment of the poor. These writings fundamentally reinterpreted Christian theology through the lens of oppression and emancipation, challenging traditional interpretations that emphasized personal salvation over social transformation. By integrating Marxist social analysis with biblical hermeneutics, liberation theologians produced works that continue to shape theological discourse, ecclesiastical practices, and social movements worldwide.
