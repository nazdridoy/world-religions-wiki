# General Epistles - Non-Pauline Letters in the New Testament

![Ancient epistolary manuscript](general_epistles_image.jpg)

The General Epistles (also called Catholic or Universal Epistles) comprise the collection of New Testament letters not attributed to Paul. These seven letters—Hebrews, James, 1-2 Peter, 1-3 John, and Jude—address broader audiences than Paul's typically community-specific correspondence and reflect the diverse theological perspectives of early Christianity. Written between approximately 60-100 CE, these texts demonstrate the pastoral concerns, theological reflections, and practical guidance offered by other apostolic figures (or their circles) as the church expanded beyond its initial foundations. Their inclusion in the New Testament canon provides essential complementary voices to Pauline theology and offers unique insights into the challenges facing first-century Christian communities.
