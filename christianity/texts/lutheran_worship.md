# Lutheran Worship - Lutheran Liturgical Resources

![Lutheran worship book and altar](lutheran_worship_image.jpg)

Lutheran liturgical resources constitute the official worship texts, hymnals, and service books used within Lutheran denominations worldwide. Emerging from Martin Luther's liturgical reforms in the 16th century, these materials balance preservation of historical Christian tradition with Protestant theological distinctives. Lutheran worship books maintain a consistent sacramental focus and christocentric emphasis while adapting to diverse cultural contexts and evolving over time through various revisions. From the earliest German liturgies to contemporary multilingual resources, these texts provide structure for congregational life, articulate Lutheran theological identity, and facilitate worship that emphasizes both Word and Sacrament as central means of grace.
