# Biblical Manuscripts - Ancient Copies of Scripture

![Ancient biblical manuscript](biblical_manuscripts_image.jpg)

Biblical manuscripts constitute the physical evidence for the transmission of the biblical text through history. These handwritten documents—ranging from tiny fragments to complete codices—provide the foundation for modern Bible translations and scholarly understanding of textual development. The study of these manuscripts (textual criticism) allows scholars to trace the history of the text, identify variations, and work toward establishing the most likely original readings. From ancient scrolls to medieval illuminated manuscripts, these documents represent not only the textual history of sacred scripture but also reflect the reverence with which Jewish and Christian communities preserved their sacred texts across centuries and cultures.
