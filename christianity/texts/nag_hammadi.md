# The Nag Hammadi Library

![Nag Hammadi codex](../images/nag_hammadi.jpg)

The Nag Hammadi Library is a collection of early Christian and Gnostic texts discovered near the Upper Egyptian town of Nag Hammadi in 1945. This remarkable archaeological find consists of thirteen leather-bound papyrus codices containing fifty-two texts, most previously unknown or thought lost. The discovery revolutionized scholarly understanding of early Christianity and Gnosticism by providing primary source materials from groups whose views were previously known mainly through the critiques of their opponents.

## Discovery and Preservation

In December 1945, local farmers discovered a sealed earthenware jar containing the thirteen codices near the base of the Jabal al-Ṭārif cliffs, close to Nag Hammadi. The texts were eventually acquired by the Coptic Museum in Cairo, though one codex was smuggled out of Egypt and sold on the antiquities market, eventually ending up in the Jung Institute in Zurich (the "Jung Codex").

The manuscripts date from approximately the 3rd to 4th centuries CE, though the texts themselves were likely composed earlier, between the 1st and 3rd centuries. Written primarily in Coptic (a late form of ancient Egyptian using Greek letters), most are thought to be translations from original Greek documents.

## Major Texts and Contents

### The Gospel of Thomas
Perhaps the most famous text in the collection, containing 114 sayings attributed to Jesus, many paralleling the canonical gospels while others are unique. Unlike the canonical gospels, it has no narrative framework but presents Jesus primarily as a revealer of secret wisdom.

### The Gospel of Philip
A collection of theological reflections and statements rather than a narrative gospel, focusing on sacramental theology, the spiritual marriage relationship, and Valentinian Gnostic concepts.

### The Gospel of Truth
A poetic homily attributed to Valentinus, one of the most influential Gnostic teachers, presenting a sophisticated creation myth and salvation narrative.

### The Apocryphon of John
A comprehensive Gnostic creation myth explaining the origin of the divine realm, the material world, and humanity through a complex cosmology involving the Demiurge (identified with the God of the Old Testament) and emanations from the true highest deity.

### Thunder, Perfect Mind
A striking poetic text where a female divine figure speaks in paradoxical "I am" statements, revealing herself as encompassing opposed qualities and transcending human categories.

### The Treatise on Resurrection
A letter addressing questions about the nature of resurrection, arguing for a spiritual rather than physical understanding of resurrection already available to the spiritually enlightened.

### Trimorphic Protennoia
A text personifying the divine thought (Protennoia) of God as a female figure who descends to the world in three forms to awaken divine knowledge in humanity.

### The Gospel of the Egyptians
Also called the "Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit," presenting a complex theogony (divine genealogy) and cosmology.

## Gnostic Themes and Teachings

The Nag Hammadi texts reveal several common themes characteristic of Gnostic thought:

1. **Divine Spark** - The belief that humans contain a fragment of the divine trapped in the material world

2. **Demiurge** - The concept of a lesser creator god (often identified with the God of the Old Testament) who fashioned the flawed material world

3. **Dualism** - A sharp distinction between the spiritual realm (good) and material realm (corrupted)

4. **Secret Knowledge (Gnosis)** - Salvation through esoteric knowledge rather than faith or works

5. **Divine Feminine** - Prominent female divine figures (Sophia, Barbelo, etc.) as emanations from the ultimate deity

6. **Reinterpretation of Genesis** - Alternative readings of creation and fall narratives

7. **Christ as Revealer** - Jesus portrayed primarily as a messenger of secret knowledge rather than a sacrificial savior

## Historical Significance

The Nag Hammadi discovery transformed scholarly understanding of early Christianity by:

- Providing direct evidence of diverse forms of Christianity in the first centuries CE
- Offering primary source texts from groups previously known only through heresiological writings
- Demonstrating the complexity of Gnostic thought beyond simplistic characterizations
- Challenging assumptions about the uniformity of early Christian beliefs
- Showing the diversity of theological positions regarding salvation, the divine, and the material world

The texts reveal that Christianity in the first few centuries was far more diverse than previously understood, with competing visions of Jesus, salvation, and cosmology circulating among different communities.

## Academic Study and Impact

Since their discovery, the Nag Hammadi texts have been the subject of intense scholarly study, resulting in:

- Complete translations in multiple languages
- Development of more nuanced understandings of Gnosticism
- Reconsideration of the development of Christian orthodoxy
- New perspectives on the role of women in early Christian communities
- Fresh insights into the interactions between Christian, Jewish, and Hellenistic philosophical traditions

The collection remains a crucial resource for understanding the diversity of early Christianity and the complex religious landscape from which orthodox Christianity emerged.
