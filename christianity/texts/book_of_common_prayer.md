![Historic Book of Common Prayer manuscript](bcp_image.jpg)

The Book of Common Prayer (BCP) stands as the foundational liturgical text of the Anglican Communion, providing the structure, language, and theological framework for worship in Anglican and Episcopal churches worldwide. First published in 1549 under the leadership of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, this revolutionary text brought worship from Latin into the vernacular, enabling full congregational participation in church services. Over its nearly 500-year history, the Book of Common Prayer has undergone multiple revisions, been translated into hundreds of languages, and profoundly influenced English literature, language, and spiritual practice far beyond Anglican boundaries.
