# Deuterocanonical Books

![Ancient manuscript of Tobit](deuterocanonical_manuscript.jpg)

The deuterocanonical books represent a collection of Jewish religious texts that are included in some Christian biblical canons but excluded from others, creating one of the most significant canonical differences between Christian traditions. Accepted as divinely inspired scripture by Catholic, Orthodox, and some Anglican churches but generally rejected by Protestant denominations, these works bridge the historical and theological gap between the Old and New Testaments. Written primarily during the Hellenistic period (300 BCE-50 CE), these texts provide crucial insights into Jewish religious thought, practice, and history during the centuries immediately preceding Christianity's emergence, while addressing themes of wisdom, resistance to oppression, faithfulness during persecution, and apocalyptic expectation.
