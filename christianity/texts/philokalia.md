# Philokalia

![Orthodox Philokalia](philokalia_manuscript.jpg)

The Philokalia is a seminal collection of spiritual texts written between the 4th and 15th centuries by Eastern Christian mystics and ascetics. Compiled in the 18th century by St. Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain and St. Makarios of Corinth, this anthology focuses on hesychasm—the mystical tradition of contemplative prayer—and the practice of inner watchfulness (nepsis). The title "Philokalia" means "love of the beautiful/good" in Greek, reflecting its purpose as a guide to cultivating divine beauty within the soul through prayer and ascetic practice.

## Historical Development

The Philokalia has a complex history of development:

- **Original Texts** (4th-15th centuries) - Spiritual writings by desert fathers and Byzantine monastics
- **Initial Compilation** (1777) - First published in Venice by St. Nikodemos and St. Makarios
- **Russian Translation** (1793) - Adapted by St. Paisius Velichkovsky as the "Dobrotolubiye"
- **Modern Revival** (20th century) - Wider circulation through new translations and spiritual renewal
- **English Translation** (1979-present) - Five-volume project initiated by G.E.H. Palmer, Philip Sherrard, and Kallistos Ware

The collection gained prominence during periods of spiritual revival in Orthodox countries, particularly 18th-century Greece and 19th-century Russia, where it profoundly influenced the development of the spiritual practice known as the Jesus Prayer.

## Content and Structure

The Philokalia contains works from approximately thirty authors, organized chronologically:

### Early Desert Tradition
- **St. Anthony the Great** - Letters on spiritual warfare
- **Evagrius Ponticus** - Texts on prayer and the spiritual life
- **St. John Cassian** - Writings on overcoming the passions

### Byzantine Hesychast Tradition
- **St. Maximus the Confessor** - Complex theological-mystical writings
- **St. Symeon the New Theologian** - Texts on mystical experience
- **St. Gregory Palamas** - Treatises defending hesychast practice

### Later Byzantine Authors
- **St. Gregory of Sinai** - Instructions on contemplative prayer
- **St. Gregory Palamas** - Theological defense of hesychast practices
- **Philotheos Kokkinos** - Biographical and spiritual works

The texts include a variety of genres: practical spiritual advice, theological treatises, biographical accounts, and collections of aphorisms.

## Key Themes and Practices

Several interrelated themes unify the diverse texts in the Philokalia:

- **Nepsis** (Watchfulness) - Attentive vigilance over thoughts and inner states
- **Hesychia** (Stillness) - Cultivation of interior silence and tranquility
- **The Jesus Prayer** - Repetition of "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner"
- **Theosis** (Deification) - Process of personal transformation into the divine likeness
- **Apatheia** (Dispassion) - Freedom from domination by passions and impulses
- **Nous** (Intellect) - Purification of the spiritual faculty of perception
- **Kardiocentrism** - Focus on the heart as the spiritual center of the person

These practices aim toward pure prayer and direct experience of the divine energies—an experience Orthodox tradition calls "uncreated light."

## Influence and Reception

The Philokalia has exerted enormous influence on Orthodox spirituality:

- **Monastic Revival** - Inspired renewal in Orthodox monasticism, especially on Mount Athos
- **Russian Spiritual Direction** - Foundational to the tradition of the startsy (spiritual elders)
- **Lay Spirituality** - Adapted for non-monastic contexts, especially through the Jesus Prayer
- **Literary Impact** - Inspired works like "The Way of a Pilgrim" and Dostoevsky's writings

In recent decades, the Philokalia has gained attention beyond Orthodox circles, influencing Western contemplative practices and comparative mystical studies.

## Contemporary Relevance

The Philokalia continues to speak to contemporary spiritual seekers:

- **Psychological Insights** - Offering profound understanding of human thoughts and emotions
- **Contemplative Practice** - Providing methodologies for attentiveness and presence
- **Holistic Spirituality** - Integrating body, mind, and spirit in prayer
- **Ecumenical Bridge** - Facilitating dialogue between Eastern and Western Christian traditions
- **Interface with Science** - Connecting with neuroscientific research on meditation and attention

Modern spiritual directors, both Orthodox and non-Orthodox, increasingly draw on the Philokalia's wisdom for guidance in contemplative practice.
