# Luther's Catechisms - Foundation of Lutheran Instruction

![Pages from Luther's Small Catechism](luther_catechisms.jpg)

Luther's Catechisms—the Small Catechism (1529) and Large Catechism (1529)—represent Martin Luther's response to the widespread religious ignorance he encountered during church visitations across Electoral Saxony. These influential instructional texts provide accessible explanations of core Christian doctrines and practices through clear, concise language aimed at different audiences: the Small Catechism designed for children and households, and the Large Catechism intended for pastors and teachers. Covering the Ten Commandments, Apostles' Creed, Lord's Prayer, sacraments, and daily prayers, these catechisms present Lutheran theology in practical, accessible forms that have shaped Protestant religious education for nearly five centuries. Their enduring influence extends across Lutheran churches worldwide as foundational texts for theological instruction, confirmation training, and Christian formation.
