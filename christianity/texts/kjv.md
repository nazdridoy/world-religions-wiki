# King James Version (KJV)

![King James Bible first edition](kjv_bible.jpg)

The King James Version (KJV), also known as the Authorized Version, stands as one of the most influential English translations of the Bible. Commissioned by King James I of England in 1604 and completed in 1611, this monumental work of literature and faith has profoundly shaped English language, culture, and Protestant Christianity for over four centuries. Revered for its majestic prose, literary excellence, and historical significance, the KJV has played an essential role in the development of English literature and religious expression while serving as the primary Bible for English-speaking Protestants until the mid-20th century.

## Historical Context and Development

### Royal Commission

- **Hampton Court Conference**: Initiated following the 1604 conference where Puritan leaders requested a new translation
- **Royal Sponsorship**: Authorized by King James I (James VI of Scotland) who saw political and religious value in a unified translation
- **Translation Directive**: Explicitly designed to be acceptable to both the Church of England and Puritan factions
- **Committee Structure**: Six panels of scholars (47-54 total) worked on different sections at Westminster, Oxford, and Cambridge
- **Oversight Process**: Translation work began in 1604 and completed in 1611
- **Editorial Framework**: 15 rules established for translators, including following the Bishops' Bible where possible
- **Publication**: First edition printed by Robert Barker, the King's Printer
- **Political Context**: Created during a period of religious tension within English Protestantism
- **Lack of Royal Funding**: Despite royal authorization, financial support came from publishers rather than the crown
- **Publication Privilege**: Barker family held exclusive printing rights for decades

### Translation Approach

- **Source Texts**: Based primarily on the Textus Receptus Greek text for the New Testament
- **Previous Translations**: Drew heavily from Tyndale, Coverdale, Geneva, and Bishops' Bibles
- **Translation Philosophy**: Formal equivalence approach (word-for-word) rather than dynamic equivalence

- **Marginalia**: Included alternate readings and cross-references but fewer interpretive notes than Geneva Bible
- **Chapter Divisions**: Maintained existing chapter divisions from earlier manuscripts
- **Verse Divisions**: Followed verse divisions established in previous translations
- **Apocrypha**: Originally included the deuterocanonical books between testaments
