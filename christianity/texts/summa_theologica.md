# Summa Theologica - Aquinas's Theological Masterwork

![Illuminated manuscript of Summa Theologica](summa_theologica_image.jpg)

The Summa Theologica (or Summa Theologiae) is the crowning achievement of Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), widely considered the most comprehensive and systematic exposition of theology in the medieval period. Written between 1265 and 1274 but left unfinished at Aquinas's death, this monumental work synthesizes Christian revelation with Aristotelian philosophy, addressing nearly every significant theological question within a rigorously logical framework. The Summa remains a foundational text for Catholic theology, philosophical inquiry, and Western intellectual history, presenting a comprehensive vision of the relationship between faith and reason.

## Structure and Organization

### Overall Framework
- **Three Parts**: Prima Pars (God and creation), Secunda Pars (ethics, subdivided into Prima Secundae and Secunda Secundae), Tertia Pars (Christ and sacraments)
