![Ancient apocalyptic manuscript](apocalyptic_image.jpg)

Apocalyptic literature represents a distinctive genre of revelatory writing that emerged in Jewish and early Christian contexts, characterized by symbolic visions, supernatural journeys, and cosmic battles depicting the ultimate triumph of good over evil. The term "apocalyptic" derives from the Greek "apokalypsis" (revelation or unveiling), suggesting the disclosure of hidden divine mysteries concerning the end of the age. While the Book of Revelation (Apocalypse of John) stands as the canonical centerpiece of Christian apocalyptic literature, this genre encompasses numerous texts, themes, and interpretive frameworks that have profoundly shaped Christian eschatology, resistance theologies, artistic expression, and popular imagination throughout history.
