# Gospels - Accounts of Jesus' Life and Ministry

![Four Gospel manuscripts](gospels_image.jpg)

The Gospels are the four canonical narratives that recount the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Written in the first century CE, these texts form the cornerstone of New Testament scripture and provide the primary source material for Christian understanding of Jesus's teachings, actions, and significance. The term "gospel" derives from the Old English "godspel," meaning "good news" (translating the Greek "euangelion"), reflecting the early Christian belief that Jesus's story represents divine salvation for humanity.

## The Four Canonical Gospels

### Matthew
- **Traditional Author**: Matthew (Levi), a tax collector who became one of Jesus's twelve apostles
- **Approximate Date**: 70-85 CE
- **Audience**: Jewish Christians
- **Key Features**: 
  - Presents Jesus as the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy and Messianic expectations
  - Contains five major discourse sections, including the Sermon on the Mount
  - Frequently cites Old Testament fulfillment ("This happened to fulfill...")
  - Emphasizes Jesus as teacher and the new Moses figure
  - Includes unique material such as the visit of the Magi and guards at the tomb

### Mark
- **Traditional Author**: John Mark, companion of Peter and interpreter of his preaching
- **Approximate Date**: 65-70 CE (generally considered the earliest gospel)
- **Audience**: Gentile Christians, likely in Rome
- **Key Features**: 
  - Shortest and most action-oriented gospel
  - Portrays Jesus as a man of action and authority
  - Contains the "Messianic secret" motif where Jesus conceals his identity
  - Emphasizes Jesus's suffering and service
  - Ends abruptly at 16:8 in earliest manuscripts (longer endings added later)

### Luke
- **Traditional Author**: Luke, a physician and companion of Paul
- **Approximate Date**: 80-85 CE
- **Audience**: Gentile Christians, specifically "Theophilus" (God-lover)
- **Key Features**: 
  - Most literary and historically detailed account
  - Special interest in marginalized groups (women, poor, outcasts)
  - Contains many unique parables (Good Samaritan, Prodigal Son)
  - Emphasizes universal salvation and social justice
  - First volume of a two-part work (Acts being the second)

### John
- **Traditional Author**: John, "the beloved disciple," one of Jesus's apostles
- **Approximate Date**: 90-100 CE
- **Audience**: Mixed community facing conflict with synagogue
- **Key Features**: 
  - Distinctly different in style and content from the Synoptic Gospels
  - Structured around seven miraculous "signs" and extended discourses
  - Strong theological focus on Jesus's divine nature ("I am" statements)
  - Emphasizes Jesus as the incarnate Word (Logos) of God
  - Contains unique material like Nicodemus, Samaritan woman, raising of Lazarus

## Literary and Historical Relationships

### Synoptic Gospels
- **Definition**: Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called "synoptic" (seeing together) due to similarities
- **Synoptic Problem**: The literary relationship between these three gospels
- **Two-Source Theory**: Mark as earliest source + hypothetical "Q" document for shared non-Markan material
- **Four-Source Theory**: Mark + Q + special Matthew material (M) + special Luke material (L)
- **Alternative Theories**: Augustinian hypothesis (Matthew first), Griesbach hypothesis (Matthew-Luke-Mark)

### John's Relationship to Synoptics
- **Distinctive Features**: 90% unique material compared to Synoptics
- **Different Chronology**: Three-year ministry with multiple Jerusalem visits (vs. one year in Synoptics)
- **Theological Development**: More explicit Christology and divine claims
- **Common Foundation**: Despite differences, shares core narrative of Jesus's ministry, death, resurrection
- **Independence Question**: Scholarly debate on whether John knew the Synoptics or developed independently

## Historical and Literary Context

### Composition Process
- **Oral Tradition**: Gospels emerged from early Christian oral storytelling and teaching
- **Community Collection**: Stories and sayings compiled by various Christian communities
- **Redaction**: Deliberate editing and arranging of materials for theological purposes
- **Multiple Sources**: Written and oral sources incorporated into final forms
- **Reception**: Gradual acceptance as authoritative across Christian communities

### Genre Considerations
- **Greco-Roman Biography**: Similar to ancient biographical works but with unique features
- **Theological Narrative**: Historical reporting with explicit faith perspective
- **Kerygmatic Purpose**: Written to proclaim rather than merely inform
- **Community Documents**: Reflect concerns and situations of particular Christian communities
- **Liturgical Function**: Composed partly for reading in worship contexts

## Theological Perspectives

### Christological Portraits
- **Varied Emphases**: Each gospel highlights different aspects of Jesus's identity

- **Mark**: Jesus as suffering servant and apocalyptic Son of Man
- **Luke**: Jesus as universal savior and champion of the marginalized
- **John**: Jesus as divine Word, equal with God the Father
- **Complementary Views**: Together provide multifaceted understanding of Jesus

### Salvation History
- **Covenant Fulfillment**: Jesus as culmination of God's promises to Israel
- **Kingdom of God**: Central theme of Jesus's preaching in the Synoptics
- **Eschatological Focus**: Anticipation of final judgment and cosmic renewal
- **Present Salvation**: John's emphasis on eternal life beginning now
- **Universal Mission**: Progressive expansion beyond Jewish boundaries

## Historical Jesus Research

### Scholarly Approaches
