*The Cost of Discipleship* (*Nachfolge* in the original German) is a theological classic written by German Lutheran pastor and theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906-1945), first published in 1937 during the rise of Nazi Germany. The work is a passionate call for Christians to take seriously the demands of following Christ in a world of compromise and nominal faith. Bonhoeffer's central argument confronts "cheap grace"—religious belief without commitment or sacrifice—and advocates for "costly grace" that demands complete submission to Christ's lordship in all areas of life.

## Historical Context

Bonhoeffer wrote *The Cost of Discipleship* during a critical period in both his personal life and European history:

### Nazi Germany and the Church Struggle
By 1937, the Nazi regime had consolidated power in Germany, and the "German Christian" movement was attempting to align Christianity with Nazi ideology. In opposition, Bonhoeffer was involved with the Confessing Church, which resisted state interference and the corruption of Christian doctrine with nationalist and racist elements.

### Finkenwalde Seminary
The book emerged from Bonhoeffer's lectures at the underground seminary in Finkenwalde, where he trained pastors for the Confessing Church after official seminaries had been co-opted by Nazi-aligned church authorities. This illegal seminary operated from 1935 until 1937, when it was closed by the Gestapo.

### Personal Transformation
The text reflects Bonhoeffer's own spiritual development, particularly his shift from academic theology to a more practical, committed Christianity following his visits to America and his exposure to the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and various Franciscan and Protestant monastic communities.

The book's themes of radical discipleship were embodied in Bonhoeffer's later resistance against the Nazi regime, which ultimately led to his imprisonment and execution at Flossenbürg concentration camp in April 1945, just weeks before Germany's surrender.

## Key Concepts and Structure

The book is divided into four major sections, each exploring different dimensions of Christian discipleship:

### Costly Grace
The opening section introduces Bonhoeffer's most famous distinction:
- **Cheap grace**: "Grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate"
- **Costly grace**: Grace that "costs a man his life" and calls him to follow Jesus Christ

Bonhoeffer argues that modern Christianity had largely embraced cheap grace—forgiveness without repentance, baptism without church discipline, communion without confession, and absolution without personal confession. In contrast, costly grace is the treasure hidden in a field for which a person will gladly sell all they have.

### The Sermon on the Mount
This extensive section provides a detailed exposition of Matthew 5-7, interpreting Jesus' teachings not as impossible ideals or merely internal attitudes, but as concrete commands meant to be obeyed by Christ's followers:
- The Beatitudes as descriptions of the disciples' character
- The visible role of disciples as "salt and light" in the world
- Jesus' intensification of the law ("You have heard it said... but I say to you")
- The radical demands of non-retaliation and enemy love
- Sincerity in piety vs. practicing religion for show
- Trust in God's provision vs. anxiety about material needs

### The Messengers
This section examines Jesus' commissioning of the disciples in Matthew 10, exploring:
- The apostles' call to specific work
- The suffering inherent in authentic witness
- The paradoxical freedom that comes through complete surrender to Christ

### The Church of Jesus Christ
The final section addresses the visible community of believers and the corporate dimension of discipleship:
- The church as Christ's body in the world
- Baptism as incorporation into Christ's death and resurrection
- The Lord's Supper as communion with Christ's body
- Daily renewal through confession and forgiveness

## Theological Significance

*The Cost of Discipleship* makes several distinctive theological contributions:

### Christological Focus
Christ stands at the center of Bonhoeffer's theology. Discipleship is fundamentally about relationship with the person of Jesus Christ, not abstract doctrines or ethical principles. As Bonhoeffer writes, "When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die."

### Incarnational Ethics
Bonhoeffer rejects both legalism and antinomianism. True obedience comes not from following rules but from Christ living in the believer, making concrete ethical demands that cannot be avoided.

### Unity of Faith and Obedience
Bonhoeffer challenges the Lutheran tendency to separate faith and works, arguing that genuine faith necessarily produces obedience: "Only he who believes is obedient, and only he who is obedient believes."

### Visible Christianity
Against pietistic tendencies to internalize faith, Bonhoeffer emphasizes the visible, embodied nature of discipleship in community and in public witness.

### Present Christ
Bonhoeffer stresses that Christ is not merely a historical figure but a present reality who continues to call followers, speak through Scripture, and transform lives.

## Literary Style and Approach

The book's impact derives partly from its distinctive style:

### Sermonic Quality
Many sections read like powerful sermons, with rhetorical flourishes, provocative questions, and direct address to the reader.

### Biblical Exegesis
Detailed interpretation of Scripture, particularly the Sermon on the Mount, forms the book's backbone.

### Paradoxical Formulations
Bonhoeffer employs paradox to convey profound truths: "The life of discipleship is not the hero-worship of a great ethical teacher, not personal attachment to the person of Christ, but obedience to the Son of God."

### Concrete Imagery
Vivid metaphors and illustrations make abstract theological concepts tangible.

### Prophetic Voice
The work speaks with urgency and authority, challenging comfortable assumptions and calling for immediate response.

## Reception and Influence

*The Cost of Discipleship* has exerted profound influence across denominational lines:

### Among Protestants
The book revitalized interest in discipleship, particularly in evangelical circles where it countered tendencies toward cheap grace and nominal Christianity.

### In Liberation Theology
Bonhoeffer's commitment to concrete obedience and solidarity with the suffering influenced liberation theologians in Latin America and elsewhere.

### Civil Rights Movement
Figures like Martin Luther King Jr. drew inspiration from Bonhoeffer's theology of resistance and his emphasis on costly discipleship.

### Neo-monasticism and Intentional Communities
Contemporary intentional Christian communities often cite Bonhoeffer's vision of authentic Christian community.

### Theological Education
The book has become standard reading in seminaries across denominations, challenging future ministers to consider the radical demands of pastoral leadership.

## Contemporary Relevance

The work's central themes continue to challenge Christians in various contexts:

### In Consumer Societies
Bonhoeffer's critique of cheap grace speaks powerfully to consumerist approaches to religion that treat Christianity as a product to be enjoyed rather than a call to be followed.

### In Times of Political Crisis
His model of faithful resistance to unjust authority provides guidance for Christians navigating complex political realities.

### In Ecumenical Dialogue
Bonhoeffer's emphasis on Christ-centered discipleship offers common ground for interdenominational cooperation.

### For Individual Believers
The personal challenge to examine whether one's faith costs anything remains as relevant as ever for individual Christians.
