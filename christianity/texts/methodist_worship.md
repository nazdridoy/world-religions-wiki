![Methodist worship service with hymnal](methodist_worship.jpg)

Methodist worship resources represent the distinctive liturgical heritage of the Wesleyan tradition, balancing scriptural fidelity, theological depth, ordered worship, and evangelical fervor. From John Wesley's adaptation of the Book of Common Prayer to contemporary United Methodist resources, these texts embody core Wesleyan emphases: grace-centered theology, practical holiness, sacramental reverence, and missional engagement. Methodist worship books have evolved to reflect changing ecclesiastical needs, cultural contexts, and theological developments while maintaining continuity with their historical roots. These resources continue to shape the worship life of millions in Methodist and Wesleyan traditions worldwide, providing structure for corporate devotion while allowing for contextual adaptation and spiritual vitality.
