Medieval exegesis represents the distinctive approach to biblical interpretation that flourished from approximately the 6th to the 15th century CE. During this period, scholars developed complex interpretive methods that built upon patristic foundations while creating innovative frameworks for understanding scripture. The medieval period saw the refinement of the "four senses" of scripture and the development of scholastic approaches that would influence biblical interpretation for centuries to come, establishing hermeneutical principles that continue to impact certain streams of Christian thought today.

### High Medieval Flowering (10th-13th centuries)
