# Institutes of the Christian Religion - Calvin's Systematic Theology

![Early edition of Calvin's Institutes](institutes_image.jpg)

The *Institutes of the Christian Religion* (*Institutio Christianae Religionis*) is John Calvin's magnum opus, first published in 1536 and expanded through multiple editions until its final form in 1559. As the most influential systematic theology of the Reformed tradition, this comprehensive work presents a thorough exposition of Protestant doctrine organized around the knowledge of God and humanity. Written during the tumultuous period of the Reformation, the Institutes provided both theological foundations for the emerging Reformed churches and practical guidance for Christians seeking to understand their faith. Its lucid style, logical organization, and biblical focus established Calvin as one of Christianity's most important theologians and continues to shape Reformed and evangelical thought worldwide.
