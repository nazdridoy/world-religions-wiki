# Septuagint - The Greek Old Testament

![Ancient Septuagint manuscript](septuagint_image.jpg)

The Septuagint (abbreviated LXX for the traditional seventy translators) represents the first major translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, produced in stages between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE primarily in Alexandria, Egypt. This monumental work served as the scripture for Greek-speaking Jews throughout the ancient Mediterranean world and later became the Old Testament for early Christians. Its profound influence on the development of Christian theology, biblical interpretation, and the language of the New Testament cannot be overstated. The Septuagint presents significant textual variations from the Masoretic Hebrew text, providing crucial insights into the development of the biblical canon and the diverse textual traditions in Second Temple Judaism.
