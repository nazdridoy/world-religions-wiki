![Historic copy of the Book of Concord](book_of_concord.jpg)

The Book of Concord (Concordia) constitutes the authoritative collection of confessional documents defining Lutheran doctrinal identity since its publication in 1580. Compiled to resolve theological disputes that emerged in the decades following Luther's death, this comprehensive anthology brings together creeds, catechisms, and confessional statements representing the theological consensus of Lutheran churches. Beginning with the ecumenical creeds and culminating in the Formula of Concord, these documents articulate distinctively Lutheran positions on justification, sacraments, church authority, and other contested theological issues of the Reformation era. As the confessional standard for Lutheran churches worldwide, the Book of Concord continues to provide doctrinal clarity, ecclesiastical unity, and theological guidance for millions of Lutherans across diverse national, cultural, and linguistic contexts.
