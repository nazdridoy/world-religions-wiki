# Westminster Confession of Faith - Definitive Reformed Statement

![Historic document of the Westminster Confession](westminster_confession.jpg)

The Westminster Confession of Faith stands as the preeminent doctrinal standard of Presbyterian and Reformed churches worldwide, representing the theological high-water mark of English Puritan thought. Created during the English Civil War by the Westminster Assembly (1643-1653), this comprehensive confession systematically articulates Reformed doctrine across thirty-three meticulously structured chapters. Its precision in theological formulation, sophisticated covenant theology, and detailed exposition of Reformed orthodoxy have made it foundational for Presbyterian church governance, doctrinal definition, and pastoral practice across four centuries. Characterized by logical coherence, scriptural saturation, and doctrinal depth, the Westminster Confession continues to shape Reformed identity, theological education, and ecclesiastical practice in the global church.
