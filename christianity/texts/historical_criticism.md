# Historical-Critical Method

![Biblical manuscript analysis](historical_criticism.jpg)

Historical criticism is a scholarly approach to biblical interpretation that emerged in the Enlightenment era and developed throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. This methodology seeks to understand biblical texts within their original historical contexts by applying academic disciplines such as history, archaeology, linguistics, and literary analysis. The historical-critical method represents a significant shift from traditional faith-based approaches to scripture, emphasizing scientific inquiry over doctrinal considerations.

## Origins and Development

The historical-critical method developed through several stages:

- **Pre-critical Period** - Before 1650, when scripture was primarily interpreted through theological lenses
- **Early Enlightenment** (1650-1800) - Initial questioning of traditional assumptions about biblical authorship
- **Classical Period** (1800-1914) - Systematic development of critical methodologies by German scholars
- **Modern Period** (1914-present) - Diversification of approaches and integration with other disciplines

Key pioneers included Baruch Spinoza, Jean Astruc, Johann Semler, Julius Wellhausen, and Hermann Gunkel, who challenged traditional views about biblical origins and composition.

## Major Methodologies

Historical criticism encompasses multiple overlapping approaches:

- **Textual Criticism** - Establishing the most reliable manuscript text by comparing ancient sources
- **Source Criticism** - Identifying hypothetical written sources behind biblical texts (e.g., the Documentary Hypothesis)
- **Form Criticism** - Analyzing the oral traditions and literary forms that shaped biblical passages
- **Redaction Criticism** - Studying how editors/compilers modified and arranged earlier material
- **Historical Context Analysis** - Examining archaeological, cultural, and historical background
- **Linguistic Analysis** - Investigating word meanings, syntactical structures, and language development
- **Literary Criticism** - Analyzing narrative techniques, themes, and structures of biblical texts

## Major Findings

Historical-critical scholarship has yielded several influential perspectives:

- **Documentary Hypothesis** - Theory that the Pentateuch was composed from four distinct sources (J, E, D, P)
- **Two-Source Theory** - Proposal that Matthew and Luke used Mark and a hypothetical "Q" source
- **Multiple Isaiah Theory** - View that the book of Isaiah has at least three distinct authors from different periods
- **Dating of Daniel** - Dating the book to the Maccabean period (2nd century BCE) rather than the Babylonian exile
- **Historical Jesus Research** - Efforts to distinguish historical facts from theological interpretation in the gospels

## Reception in Christian Traditions

Different Christian traditions have varied responses to historical criticism:

- **Liberal Protestantism** - Largely embraced historical-critical methods
- **Roman Catholicism** - Initially resistant but gradually incorporated since *Divino Afflante Spiritu* (1943)
- **Orthodox Christianity** - Generally cautious about historical-critical approaches
- **Evangelical Protestantism** - Often skeptical but increasingly engages with modified approaches
- **Fundamentalism** - Typically rejects historical criticism as undermining biblical authority

## Contemporary Developments

Recent trends in historical criticism include:

- **Integration with Literary Approaches** - Greater attention to narrative and rhetorical features
- **Sociological Perspectives** - Examining social contexts and power dynamics in biblical texts
- **Canonical Criticism** - Analyzing texts within their final canonical form
- **Reception History** - Studying how texts have been interpreted throughout history
- **Postcolonial and Feminist Readings** - Examining texts through lenses of power, gender, and marginalization
