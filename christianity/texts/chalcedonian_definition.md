# Chalcedonian Definition

The Chalcedonian Definition (also known as the Chalcedonian Creed) is a foundational Christological statement adopted at the Fourth Ecumenical Council held in Chalcedon (near Constantinople) in 451 CE. This concise yet profound theological formulation addresses the relationship between Christ's divinity and humanity, establishing what became the orthodox position for most mainstream Christian traditions. The Definition represents a watershed moment in early Christian theological development and continues to serve as a doctrinal boundary marker for Christological orthodoxy.

## Historical Context

The Definition emerged from intense theological debates of the 5th century:

- **Nestorian Controversy** - Dispute over whether Mary should be called "Theotokos" (God-bearer)
- **Monophysite Teaching** - Claim that Christ had only one nature (divine)
- **Dyophysite Position** - Assertion that Christ had two separate natures
- **Imperial Politics** - Theological divisions threatening imperial unity

The Council of Chalcedon was convened by Emperor Marcian with approximately 520 bishops attending, primarily from the Eastern churches. It sought to navigate between the Alexandrian emphasis on Christ's divinity and the Antiochene emphasis on his humanity.

## Text and Content

The Definition's central formulation declares that Christ is:

> "One and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, recognized in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation; the distinction of natures being in no way annulled by the union, but rather the characteristics of each nature being preserved and coming together to form one person and subsistence."

This statement articulates several crucial theological points:

- **Hypostatic Union** - Divine and human natures united in one person (hypostasis)
- **Without Confusion** - The natures do not blend into a hybrid
- **Without Change** - Neither nature is transformed into the other
- **Without Division** - Christ is not divided into two persons
- **Without Separation** - The natures are permanently united

## Theological Significance

The Chalcedonian Definition established several enduring principles:

- **Full Divinity** - Christ possesses complete divine nature identical to the Father's
- **Full Humanity** - Christ possesses complete human nature like ours, yet without sin
- **Unified Personhood** - The two natures exist in one undivided person
- **Asymmetrical Relationship** - The human nature is assumed by the divine person

These principles became the foundation for subsequent Christological developments in most Christian traditions, offering language for discussing the mystery of the Incarnation.

## Reception and Division

The Definition's reception varied dramatically across Christendom:

- **Chalcedonian Churches** - Accepted by Roman, Byzantine, and most Western churches
- **Non-Chalcedonian Churches** - Rejected by Oriental Orthodox churches (including Coptic, Syrian, Armenian, and Ethiopian)
- **Church of the East** - Had already separated after the Council of Ephesus (431 CE)

The schism between Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian churches persisted for 1,500 years. However, modern ecumenical dialogues suggest that some historical divisions may have stemmed from linguistic and cultural differences rather than substantive theological disagreement.

## Contemporary Relevance

The Definition remains central to Christological understanding in most churches:

- **Roman Catholicism** - Maintains Chalcedonian Christology as dogmatic teaching
- **Eastern Orthodoxy** - Centers theological vision around Chalcedonian formulation
- **Protestantism** - Generally accepts Chalcedonian parameters across denominations
- **Modern Dialogue** - Serves as foundation for ecumenical conversations about Christ

Recent joint declarations between Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian churches have acknowledged substantial agreement on Christology despite historical divisions.
