The Divine Comedy (*Divina Commedia*) is a monumental 14th-century Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri that presents a comprehensive theological vision of the Christian afterlife through an allegorical journey through Hell (Inferno), Purgatory (Purgatorio), and Paradise (Paradiso). Completed around 1320, shortly before Dante's death, this masterpiece represents one of Christianity's most influential literary expressions, blending medieval Catholic theology, classical learning, contemporary politics, and personal experience into an intricate symbolic framework. Its profound exploration of sin, redemption, and divine love has shaped Western imagination of the afterlife and provided theological insights for scholars and spiritual seekers across centuries.
