# Global Translations of the Bible

![World Bibles in various languages](global_translations.jpg)

The Bible stands as the most translated text in human history, available in over 3,400 languages that together reach more than 98% of the world's population. This extraordinary achievement represents centuries of effort by missionary linguists, indigenous translators, and international Bible societies working to make scripture accessible across cultural and linguistic boundaries. Global Bible translations not only serve the spiritual needs of diverse Christian communities but often play crucial roles in language preservation, literacy development, and cultural identity formation. The history and ongoing development of these translations reflect both the universal aspirations of Christianity and its remarkable capacity for local contextualization across vastly different cultural contexts.
