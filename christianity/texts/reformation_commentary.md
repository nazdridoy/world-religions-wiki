# Reformation Commentary - Protestant Biblical Interpretation

![Reformation-era Bible commentary page](reformation_commentary_image.jpg)

Reformation commentary represents the distinctive approach to biblical interpretation that emerged among Protestant reformers in the 16th century. Moving away from medieval allegorical and scholastic methods, reformers like Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, and their successors developed exegetical principles emphasizing the literal-historical sense of scripture, vernacular accessibility, and the centrality of Christ. These commentaries not only shaped Protestant theology but also established hermeneutical approaches that continue to influence biblical interpretation in many Christian traditions today, with their emphasis on the clarity of scripture, grammatical-historical analysis, and application to Christian life.
