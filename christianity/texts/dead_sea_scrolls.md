# Dead Sea Scrolls

The Dead Sea Scrolls represent one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 20th century, comprising approximately 981 different texts found between 1947 and 1956 in eleven caves near the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea. Dating primarily from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE, these ancient Jewish manuscripts include the earliest known biblical texts, providing unprecedented insight into the textual development of the Hebrew Bible and the religious landscape of Second Temple Judaism. Written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, the scrolls contain biblical manuscripts, apocryphal texts, sectarian documents, and previously unknown writings that have revolutionized scholarly understanding of the transmission of biblical texts and the diversity of Jewish religious thought during this formative period for both Judaism and early Christianity.
