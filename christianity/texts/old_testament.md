# Old Testament - Hebrew Scriptures in Christian Context

![Ancient Hebrew scroll](old_testament_image.jpg)

The Old Testament represents the collection of Hebrew scriptures that Christians have adopted as the first major section of their Bible. Comprising between 39 and 46 books (depending on denominational tradition), these texts chronicle God's relationship with humanityâ€”particularly through the history, law, prophecy, wisdom, and poetry of ancient Israel. While sharing substantial content with the Jewish Tanakh, the Christian Old Testament differs in arrangement, interpretation, and in some traditions, content. Christians understand these texts as preparatory revelation that finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ as documented in the New Testament.
