# Vulgate - The Latin Bible

![Illuminated Vulgate manuscript page](vulgate_image.jpg)

The Vulgate represents one of the most influential biblical translations in history, serving as the official Latin Bible of the Roman Catholic Church for more than a millennium. Primarily translated by Saint Jerome in the late 4th century at the request of Pope Damasus I, this monumental work aimed to replace the inconsistent Old Latin translations with a standardized text based on the best available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek sources. The Vulgate's profound cultural, theological, and linguistic impact extended far beyond religious circles, shaping Western intellectual history, art, literature, and the development of Latin itself throughout the medieval period and beyond.
