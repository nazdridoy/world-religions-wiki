# Contextual Interpretations - Liberation and Identity-Based Biblical Readings

![Contextual Bible study group](contextual_interpretations_image.jpg)

Contextual interpretations of scripture represent diverse hermeneutical approaches that emerged primarily in the latter half of the 20th century, challenging traditional Western academic readings by prioritizing the social location and lived experiences of marginalized communities. These interpretive methods—including liberation theology, feminist biblical criticism, womanist, mujerista, Black, postcolonial, queer, and disability hermeneutics—read biblical texts through the lens of particular struggles for justice and dignity. By centering previously silenced voices and perspectives, contextual interpretations have expanded the conversation about biblical meaning, uncovered overlooked themes of liberation, and demonstrated how scripture can function as a resource for resistance and hope among oppressed communities worldwide.
