Christianity is a monotheistic religion centered on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. With approximately 2.4 billion adherents worldwide, it is the world's largest religion. Christianity emerged in the 1st century CE in the region of Judea (modern-day Israel and Palestine) as a Jewish messianic movement and gradually spread throughout the Roman Empire and beyond.

## Overview

Christianity teaches that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, fully divine and fully human, who was sent to save humanity from sin and death. Christians believe in one God who exists as a Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments, is considered the sacred scripture, though different traditions vary in their interpretation and approach to these texts.

Throughout its 2,000-year history, Christianity has developed diverse theological traditions, denominational structures, and cultural expressions while maintaining core beliefs about Jesus's divinity, death, and resurrection. Christianity has profoundly influenced art, literature, philosophy, ethics, and political systems across the world.
