# Biblical Criticism

![Biblical scholars examining ancient texts](biblical_criticism.jpg)

Biblical criticism encompasses the various scholarly approaches and methodologies used to study, analyze, and interpret biblical texts. Unlike devotional reading, biblical criticism applies academic methods from linguistics, history, archaeology, literary theory, and other disciplines to examine the Bible's origins, development, and meaning. These approaches have profoundly influenced how Christians in different traditions understand and interpret scripture.

## Historical Development

### Early Roots (1st-17th Centuries)

While modern biblical criticism emerged in the Enlightenment era, critical engagement with biblical texts has ancient roots:

- Early Church Fathers like Origen and Jerome compared manuscript variations
- Medieval Jewish scholars like Abraham ibn Ezra noted anachronisms in the Pentateuch
- Renaissance humanists applied philological methods to biblical languages
- Reformation-era debates highlighted textual and interpretive questions
- Spinoza's *Theologico-Political Treatise* (1670) questioned traditional Mosaic authorship

### Enlightenment Period (18th-19th Centuries)

Modern biblical criticism developed during the Enlightenment:

- Jean Astruc (1753) identified distinct sources in Genesis based on divine names
- Johann Gottfried Eichhorn applied historical-critical methods to the Old Testament
- Julius Wellhausen formulated the Documentary Hypothesis of Pentateuchal composition
- F.C. Baur and the Tübingen School examined New Testament authorship
- Heinrich Julius Holtzmann developed the Synoptic Problem's two-source hypothesis

> "The primary task of biblical criticism is not to destroy faith but to ensure that faith is directed to what Scripture actually says rather than to what we think or hope it says." — Raymond Brown

### Twentieth Century Developments

The 20th century brought major methodological innovations:

- Form criticism (Hermann Gunkel, Rudolf Bultmann) studied oral traditions
- Redaction criticism (Günther Bornkamm, Willi Marxsen) examined editorial processes
- Canonical criticism (Brevard Childs) focused on the final form of scripture
- Sociological approaches (Wayne Meeks, Gerd Theissen) studied texts in social context
- Narrative criticism (Robert Alter, Frank Kermode) applied literary analysis
- Feminist criticism (Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza, Phyllis Trible) highlighted gender perspectives

## Major Approaches

### Textual Criticism

Textual criticism determines the most reliable text from manuscript evidence:

- Examines thousands of manuscripts and early translations
- Analyzes internal and external evidence for textual variants
- Establishes critical editions like Nestle-Aland and United Bible Societies texts
- Studies scribal habits and transmission history
- Evaluates major discoveries like Dead Sea Scrolls and Chester Beatty Papyri

Key contributions:
- Identifying the differences between manuscript traditions
- Understanding the reliability of biblical transmission
- Providing scholarly foundations for modern translations
- Highlighting the human history of the biblical text
- Establishing criteria for evaluating variant readings

### Source Criticism

Source criticism identifies and reconstructs earlier written sources:

- Documentary Hypothesis identifies Pentateuch sources (J, E, D, P)
- Two-Source Hypothesis proposes Mark and Q as sources for Matthew and Luke
- Analyzes how authors combined and edited source materials
- Examines stylistic variations, terminological differences, duplications, and contradictions
- Traces historical development of biblical literature

Modern developments include:
- Fragmentary hypotheses challenging traditional source divisions
- Supplementary models emphasizing gradual textual expansion
- Studies of compositional techniques in ancient Near Eastern literature
- Digital humanities approaches to linguistic analysis
- Cross-cultural comparative studies

### Form Criticism

Form criticism studies the pre-literary oral traditions:

- Identifies standard literary forms or genres (miracle stories, parables, hymns, etc.)
- Connects forms to specific life contexts (Sitz im Leben)
- Traces the development from oral tradition to written text
- Highlights the communal origins of biblical material
- Examines how form shapes meaning

Applications include:
- Classification of psalm types (lament, thanksgiving, royal, etc.)
- Analysis of prophetic speech patterns
- Study of gospel pericopae as independent oral units
- Recognition of conventional patterns in wisdom literature
- Understanding liturgical backgrounds of biblical texts

### Historical Criticism

Historical criticism investigates historical contexts and authorship:

- Examines historical reliability and accuracy
- Places texts in their ancient historical settings
- Evaluates historical claims against external evidence
- Studies authorship, dating, and provenance questions
- Reconstructs historical events behind the texts

Methods include:
- Archaeological correlation with biblical narratives
- Analysis of historical indicators within texts
- Comparison with non-biblical historical sources
- Study of ancient languages and cultural practices
- Examination of historical presuppositions in texts

### Literary Criticism

Literary criticism analyzes biblical texts as literature:

- Studies narrative techniques, characterization, plot structure
- Examines rhetorical devices and literary conventions
- Applies modern literary theories (structuralism, deconstruction, etc.)
- Focuses on the Bible as a coherent literary work
- Analyzes imagery, metaphor, and symbolic language

Recent developments include:
- Reader-response approaches emphasizing the reader's role
- Intertextual studies examining connections between biblical texts
- Narrative theology exploring how biblical stories shape belief
- Poetic analysis of Hebrew parallelism and structure
- Genre studies identifying and analyzing biblical literary forms

## Denominational Responses

### Roman Catholic Approaches

The Catholic Church's position evolved significantly:

- Initially cautious with Pope Leo XIII's *Providentissimus Deus* (1893)
- Pius XII's *Divino Afflante Spiritu* (1943) encouraged scholarly methods
- Vatican II's *Dei Verbum* (1965) affirmed critical scholarship's value
- Pontifical Biblical Commission guidelines balance criticism with tradition
- Contemporary Catholic scholarship fully engages critical methods

> "The interpreter of Sacred Scripture, in order to see clearly what God wanted to communicate to us, should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended, and what God wanted to manifest by means of their words." — *Dei Verbum*, Vatican II

### Eastern Orthodox Views

Eastern Orthodoxy maintains distinct perspectives:

- Emphasis on scripture's interpretation within church tradition
- Less historical focus, more liturgical and patristic context
- Growing engagement with critical scholarship while maintaining theological boundaries
- Concern for spiritual meaning over historical reconstruction
- Balance between academic study and church authority

### Protestant Positions

Protestant denominations vary widely:

- Mainline denominations generally embrace critical methods
- Evangelical scholars integrate criticism with belief in biblical authority
- Conservative traditions may express concerns about skeptical presuppositions
- Reformed traditions emphasize canonical context and theological interpretation
- Lutheran approaches often balance historical-critical and confessional perspectives

### Evangelical Responses

Evangelical scholars have developed several responses:

- "Believing criticism" maintaining faith commitments while using critical tools
- "Canonical-theological" approaches prioritizing the final form of scripture
- Critiques of naturalistic presuppositions in some critical methods
- Alternative models for authorship and composition questions
- Integration of criticism with doctrines of inspiration and authority

## Contemporary Developments

### Postmodern Approaches

Postmodern biblical criticism has emerged since the late 20th century:

- Ideological criticism examining power dynamics in texts and interpretation
- Postcolonial readings highlighting imperial contexts and marginalized perspectives
- Queer interpretation addressing gender and sexuality
- Cultural studies approaches examining social construction of meaning
- Disability studies perspectives on biblical portrayals of disability

### Global Perspectives

Globalization has diversified biblical criticism:

- African contextual readings emphasizing community and ancestral connections
- Latin American liberation approaches highlighting socioeconomic justice
- Asian interpretations engaging indigenous religious traditions
- Indigenous hermeneutics connecting biblical themes to native spiritualities
- Intercultural biblical criticism fostering dialogue between contexts

### Digital Humanities

Technological advances have transformed biblical scholarship:

- Computer-assisted linguistic analysis of biblical texts
