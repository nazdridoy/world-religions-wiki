# Holy Spirit Person

![Holy Spirit depicted in Christian art](holy_spirit.jpg)

The doctrine of the Holy Spirit's personhood stands as a distinctive and essential element of Christian theology. While Christianity has always recognized the Spirit as part of the Trinity, the specific understanding of the Holy Spirit as a full and distinct person—not merely a force, power, or extension of God—developed gradually in Christian thought. This teaching affirms that the Holy Spirit possesses personal attributes, engages in personal actions, and relates personally to the Father, Son, and believers.

## Biblical Foundations

### Old Testament Background

The Hebrew Scriptures use the term "ruach" (spirit/breath/wind) in ways that prepare for later understanding of the Spirit's personhood:

- **Creation narrative**: "The Spirit of God was hovering over the waters" (Genesis 1:2)
- **Divine empowerment**: The Spirit coming upon leaders, judges, prophets (Numbers 11:25, Judges 6:34)
- **Personal language**: "Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me" (Psalm 51:11)
- **Messianic prophecy**: "The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him" (Isaiah 11:2)
- **Personal activity**: "My Spirit will not contend with humans forever" (Genesis 6:3)
- **Future promise**: "I will pour out my Spirit on all people" (Joel 2:28)

While these texts do not fully articulate the Spirit's personhood, they present the Spirit as more than merely God's power.

### New Testament Development

The New Testament presents the Holy Spirit with increasingly clear personal attributes:

- **Personal pronouns**: Jesus refers to the Spirit as "he" not "it" (John 14:26, 16:13)
- **Personal names**: "Counselor," "Advocate," "Helper" (Parakletos) (John 14:16, 26)
- **Personal emotions**: The Spirit can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30)
- **Personal actions**:
  - Speaks (Acts 8:29, 13:2, Revelation 2:7)
  - Teaches (John 14:26)
  - Guides (John 16:13, Romans 8:14)
  - Bears witness (Romans 8:16)
  - Intercedes (Romans 8:26-27)
  - Searches all things (1 Corinthians 2:10)
  - Determines spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 12:11)
- **Personal relationships**:
  - With the Father and Son (Matthew 28:19, 2 Corinthians 13:14)
  - With the church (Acts 15:28, "It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us")
  - With individuals (Acts 8:29, 10:19-20)

## Historical Development

### Early Church Understanding

The early church gradually articulated the Spirit's personhood:

- **Apostolic Fathers** (1st-2nd centuries): Referenced the Spirit in trinitarian formulas but with minimal reflection on personhood
- **Justin Martyr** (c.100-165): Spoke of the Spirit primarily as divine power
- **Irenaeus** (c.130-202): Described the Spirit as one of God's "hands" along with the Son
- **Tertullian** (c.155-220): First to use the term "Trinity" and apply person language (persona) to Spirit
- **Origen** (c.185-254): Developed more robust trinitarian theology including Spirit's personhood

### Pneumatological Controversies

Challenges to the Spirit's full personhood and deity emerged:

- **Macedonianism/Pneumatomachianism** (4th century): Taught the Spirit was a created being subordinate to the Son
- **Arianism**: While focused on the Son, also diminished the Spirit's status
- **Various modalist views**: Reduced the three persons to modes of divine operation

### Conciliar Definitions

Church councils progressively defined orthodox pneumatology:

- **Council of Nicaea** (325): Mentioned the Spirit but without elaboration
- **Council of Constantinople** (381): Expanded the creed to affirm the Spirit as "the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, who spoke through the prophets"
- **Council of Chalcedon** (451): Reinforced trinitarian framework including Spirit's full deity

### The Filioque Controversy

A significant dispute arose regarding the Spirit's procession:
- Eastern church maintained the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone
- Western church added "and the Son" (filioque) to the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed
- This difference became a major factor in the Great Schism of 1054
- Various reconciliation attempts have proposed formulations like "through the Son"

### Medieval and Reformation Developments

Theological reflection on the Spirit's personhood continued:

- **Augustine** (354-430): Described the Spirit as the bond of love between Father and Son
- **Eastern theologians**: Emphasized Spirit's distinct hypostasis and role in divine economy
- **Thomas Aquinas** (1225-1274): Systematic treatment of Spirit as "mutual love" of Father and Son
- **Reformers**: Renewed emphasis on Spirit's work in salvation and Scripture
- **John Calvin** (1509-1564): Called the Spirit the "bond by which Christ effectually unites us to himself"

## Theological Dimensions

### Person vs. Impersonal Force

The distinction between personhood and impersonal power is crucial:

- **Not merely energy**: More than divine power or influence
- **Not an extension**: Distinct from Father and Son, not merely their action
- **Not a symbol**: Actual person, not metaphorical representation
- **Not a creation**: Uncreated, eternal divine person
- **Not a mode**: Permanent person, not temporary manifestation

### Attributes of Personhood

The Spirit possesses all essential marks of personhood:

1. **Intellect**: Knows the thoughts of God (1 Corinthians 2:10-11)
2. **Emotion**: Can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30), expresses joy (Luke 10:21)
3. **Will**: Distributes gifts "as he determines" (1 Corinthians 12:11)
4. **Self-consciousness**: Distinguished from Father and Son
5. **Relational capacity**: Communes with God and humans
6. **Moral character**: Holy, truthful, faithful
7. **Agency**: Acts with purpose and intention

### Trinitarian Relations

The Spirit's personhood exists within trinitarian relationships:

- **Eternal procession**: From the Father (Eastern view) or Father and Son (Western view)
- **Mutual glorification**: Spirit glorifies the Son; Son sends the Spirit
- **Economic roles**: Distinct but unified operations in creation and redemption
- **Perichoresis**: Mutual indwelling of the three persons
- **Appropriation**: Certain works especially attributed to Spirit though involving all persons

### Relation to Christ

The Spirit has a special relationship with the Son:

- **Incarnation**: Role in Christ's conception (Luke 1:35)
- **Baptism**: Descending upon Jesus (Matthew 3:16)
- **Ministry empowerment**: Anointing Jesus for service (Luke 4:18)
- **Resurrection**: Raising Christ from dead (Romans 8:11)
- **Pentecost**: Sent by the ascended Christ (Acts 2:33)
- **Glorification**: Bears witness to Christ (John 15:26)
- **Body of Christ**: Forms and animates the church

## Denominational Perspectives

### Eastern Orthodox

Orthodox pneumatology emphasizes:
- **Procession from the Father alone**: Rejection of filioque
- **Equal divinity**: Spirit as fully God without subordination
- **Divine economy**: Spirit's role in creation, incarnation, and deification

- **Theosis**: Spirit's role in humanity's participation in divine nature

### Roman Catholic

Catholic teaching highlights:
- **Filioque**: Spirit proceeds from Father and Son
- **Magisterium**: Spirit guiding church's teaching authority
- **Sacramental presence**: Spirit's operation in seven sacraments

- **Recent emphasis**: Renewal of pneumatological focus since Vatican II

### Protestant Traditions

Various Protestant approaches include:
- **Lutheran**: Emphasis on Spirit's work through Word and sacraments

- **Anglican**: Balance of Word and Spirit, catholic and evangelical
- **Pentecostal/Charismatic**: Emphasis on direct experience and gifts of the Spirit
- **Evangelical**: Focus on Spirit's role in conversion and sanctification

## Practical Significance

- **Fire/Flames**: Connected to Pentecost experience
- **Wind**: Invisible yet powerful movement
- **Water**: Life-giving, cleansing, refreshing
- **Oil**: Anointing for consecration and healing
- **Breath**: Divine life-giving inspiration
