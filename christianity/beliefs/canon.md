# Biblical Canon

![Biblical manuscripts and codices](canon.jpg)

The Biblical canon refers to the authoritative collection of texts recognized as scripture by Christian traditions. The term "canon" derives from the Greek word κανών (kanon), meaning "rule" or "measuring stick." The development of the Christian Biblical canon was a complex historical process spanning several centuries, resulting in variations between major Christian traditions.

## Historical Development

### Early Christian Period (1st-3rd Centuries)

The earliest Christians initially used Jewish scriptures (later called the Old Testament) along with oral traditions about Jesus:

- Jewish scriptures were accepted from the beginning, though the exact scope varied
- Apostolic writings began circulating among churches
- The four Gospels gained recognition by the late 2nd century
- Paul's letters were collected and widely distributed
- The Muratorian Fragment (c. 170 CE) provides the earliest known list of New Testament books

### Formation Period (4th-5th Centuries)

Several factors contributed to the formalization of the canon:

- Need to combat heretical movements and their texts
- Desire for consistency in liturgical readings
- Persecution necessitated clear identification of sacred texts
- Conversion of Emperor Constantine and Christianity's new status

Key milestones include:
- Athanasius' Easter Letter (367 CE) listing the 27 books of the New Testament
- Council of Hippo (393 CE) affirming the 27-book New Testament 
- Council of Carthage (397 CE) confirming Hippo's list
- Jerome's Latin Vulgate translation standardizing the text

### Eastern and Western Developments

The Eastern and Western churches followed slightly different paths:

> "Let this be a criterion for the trustworthy books: those that are disputed by all, those that are disputed by the majority, and those that are undisputed by the majority." — Eusebius of Caesarea, *Ecclesiastical History*

Eastern churches:
- Generally accepted the Hebrew canon for Old Testament
- Some continued to value certain deuterocanonical works 
- Various traditions developed slightly different Old Testament canons

Western church:
- Adopted broader Septuagint-based Old Testament including deuterocanonical books
- Augustine's influence supported the inclusion of deuterocanonical books
- Jerome distinguished between canonical and deuterocanonical works

## Major Canon Traditions

### Roman Catholic Canon

The Council of Trent (1546) definitively established the Catholic canon:

- 46 Old Testament books (including 7 deuterocanonical books)
- 27 New Testament books
- Deuterocanonical books: Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Baruch (with Letter of Jeremiah), 1 and 2 Maccabees, and additions to Esther and Daniel

### Eastern Orthodox Canon

Eastern Orthodox churches have a slightly more flexible approach:

- Generally accept the same 27 New Testament books
- Old Testament includes deuterocanonical books, plus 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh, and Psalm 151
- The Russian Orthodox tradition adds 2 Esdras (4 Ezra)
- Generally distinguish between "canonical" and "ecclesiastical" books

### Protestant Canon

The Protestant Reformation brought significant changes:

- Martin Luther questioned the canonicity of Hebrews, James, Jude, and Revelation
- Eventually accepted all 27 New Testament books
- Rejected deuterocanonical books as non-canonical (calling them "Apocrypha")
- Protestant Old Testament consists of 39 books (the Hebrew canon)
- Some early Protestant Bibles included Apocrypha as a separate section

> "The authority of Scripture is greater than that of the Church... The Church does not determine what Scripture is, but acknowledges it." — Martin Luther

### Oriental Orthodox Variations

Oriental Orthodox churches (Coptic, Ethiopian, Armenian, Syrian) have distinct variations:

- Ethiopian Orthodox Church has the largest canon (81 books)
- Includes books like Jubilees and Enoch not found in other canons
- Syriac churches have historically had a smaller New Testament canon

## Theological Significance

### Authority Source

Different traditions view the canon's authority differently:

- Catholic view: Canon established by Church authority guided by the Holy Spirit
- Protestant view: Canon recognized because books possessed inherent authority
- Orthodox view: Canon emerged through the Church's life, guided by Holy Tradition

### Interpretive Framework

The canon provides the primary framework for Christian theology:

- Establishes boundaries for authoritative teaching
- Different canons influence theological emphases
- Hermeneutical approaches vary based on canonical understanding
- Textual relationships within the canon shape interpretation

### Ecumenical Implications

Canon differences have significant ecumenical implications:

- Different texts lead to different theological traditions
- Modern ecumenical translations often include deuterocanonical books in separate sections
- Interfaith dialogue (especially Jewish-Christian) affected by canon differences
- Questions of canon have been central to reunion discussions

## Modern Perspectives

### Historical-Critical Approaches

Modern scholarship has influenced understanding of the canon:

- Critical study of the historical process of canonization
- Archaeological discoveries (Dead Sea Scrolls, Nag Hammadi library) providing context
- Recognition of the diversity of early Christianity
- Study of non-canonical early Christian literature

### Contemporary Questions

Several ongoing issues surround the Biblical canon:

- The relationship between canon and textual criticism
- The significance of ancient non-canonical texts for Christian understanding
- Questions about the "closed" nature of the canon
- Digital Bible formats and their impact on canonical boundaries
- Trends toward functional rather than formal canonical boundaries

### Canonical Criticism

A specialized field of biblical studies focuses on the canonical process:

- Pioneered by Brevard Childs and James Sanders
- Studies the theological significance of the final form of canonical texts
- Examines how canonical context shapes meaning
- Considers the community processes that formed the canon
