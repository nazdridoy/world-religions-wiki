Prayer stands as one of the most fundamental expressions of Christian faith, representing both the intimate communication between believers and God and a transformative spiritual practice. Throughout Christian history, theological reflection on prayer has explored its nature, purpose, forms, and efficacy, resulting in diverse understandings across different traditions.

## Biblical Foundations

### Old Testament Roots

The Hebrew Bible provides key foundations for Christian prayer theology:

- **Patriarchal Examples**: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob building altars and "calling on the name of the Lord"
- **Mosaic Intercession**: Moses pleading for Israel's deliverance and forgiveness
- **Davidic Prayers**: Psalms as template for praise, lament, thanksgiving, and petition
- **Prophetic Prayer**: Jeremiah, Daniel, and others communicating divine messages and interceding
- **Temple Focus**: Centralized worship and prayer directed toward God's dwelling place

### New Testament Developments

Jesus and the early church transformed prayer understanding:

- **Jesus' Example**: Regular prayer habits, withdrawal for prayer, Garden of Gethsemane
- **Jesus' Teaching**: The Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13; Luke 11:2-4) as model
- **Pauline Theology**: Prayer in the Spirit (Romans 8:26-27), without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17)
- **Early Church Practice**: Communal prayer gatherings (Acts 2:42), prayer for healing (James 5:14-15)
- **Trinitarian Dimensions**: Prayer to the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit

> "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others... But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen." (Matthew 6:5-6)
