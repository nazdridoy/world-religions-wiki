![Christian stewardship of creation](environmental_ethics.jpg)

Christian environmental ethics examines the moral relationship between humans and the natural world through theological reflection on creation, stewardship, and eschatology. While Christian environmental thought has historically received less attention than other ethical domains, recent decades have seen a flourishing of theological engagement with ecological concerns and the development of diverse Christian approaches to environmental responsibility.

## Biblical Foundations

### Creation Narratives

Genesis accounts provide key insights for environmental ethics:

- **Genesis 1:26-28**: Humans given "dominion" over creation
- **Genesis 2:15**: Adam placed in garden "to work it and take care of it"
- **Genesis 9:8-17**: God's covenant with Noah includes all living creatures
- **Psalm 24:1**: "The earth is the LORD's and everything in it"
- **Psalm 104**: Celebration of God's care for all creatures

Different interpretations emphasize:
- Responsible stewardship of divine property
- Human accountability to God for treatment of creation
- Intrinsic value of creation independent of utility to humans
- Ecological interconnections in divine design

### Wisdom Literature

Biblical wisdom writings provide ecological insights:

- **Job 38-41**: God's speech highlighting knowledge of and care for wild nature
- **Proverbs 12:10**: "The righteous care for the needs of their animals"
- **Psalm 148**: All creation praised as worshipping God
- **Ecclesiastes 3:18-21**: Recognition of kinship between humans and animals

### Prophetic Tradition

Hebrew prophets connected environmental and social justice:

- **Isaiah 24:4-6**: Earth suffers due to human covenant violations
- **Hosea 4:1-3**: Environmental degradation linked to moral failure
- **Jeremiah 2:7**: Critique of land destruction after inheriting good land
- **Ezekiel 34:17-18**: Condemnation of those who foul resources needed by others

### New Testament Perspectives

The New Testament contains ecological dimensions:

- **Romans 8:19-23**: Creation "groaning" awaiting redemption with humans
- **Colossians 1:15-20**: Christ's reconciling work encompasses all creation
- **Revelation 11:18**: God will "destroy those who destroy the earth"
- **Matthew 6:26-30**: God's care for birds and flowers

## Historical Developments

### Contemporary Renaissance

Recent decades have seen renewed Christian environmental engagement:
