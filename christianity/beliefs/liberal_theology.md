# Liberal Theology

![Liberal theological tradition](liberal_theology.jpg)

Liberal theology represents a significant modern approach to Christian thought that emerged in the 19th century as a response to Enlightenment rationalism and scientific developments. Rather than rejecting modern intellectual currents, liberal theology sought to reinterpret Christian faith in dialogue with contemporary knowledge and cultural shifts. It is characterized by its emphasis on divine immanence, the ethical teachings of Jesus, religious experience, historical-critical biblical interpretation, and social reform, while often reconsidering traditional doctrinal formulations.
