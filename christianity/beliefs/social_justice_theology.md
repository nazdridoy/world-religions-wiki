Social justice theology represents a broad stream of Christian thought and practice that addresses systemic inequities in society through the lens of biblical principles of justice, equality, and human dignity. While manifesting in diverse forms across denominations and historical periods, it consistently emphasizes that authentic Christian faith must express itself in working toward just social structures and equitable distribution of resources.

## Biblical Foundations

### Old Testament Roots

The Hebrew Scriptures establish justice as central to God's character and expectations:

- **Prophetic Literature**: Amos, Isaiah, and Micah strongly condemn economic exploitation and call for justice
- **Jubilee Laws** (Leviticus 25): Mandate periodic redistribution of land and cancellation of debts
- **Torah Provisions**: Special protection for widows, orphans, and foreigners
- **Sabbath Regulations**: Limitations on work and provisions for rest for all people
- **Covenant Expectations**: Justice as integral to Israel's covenant with God

Key passages include:
> "He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?" (Micah 6:8)

> "Learn to do good; seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow." (Isaiah 1:17)

### New Testament Developments

Jesus and the early church continued and deepened these themes:

- **Jesus' Ministry**: Prioritized marginalized groups and challenged economic injustice
- **Kingdom of God**: Described as involving social transformation and new power relations
- **Early Church Practice**: Communal sharing of goods in Acts 2-4
