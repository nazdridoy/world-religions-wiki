# Consubstantiation

![Lutheran communion service](consubstantiation.jpg)

Consubstantiation is a theological term often used to describe the Lutheran understanding of Christ's presence in the Eucharist (Lord's Supper or Holy Communion). This doctrine teaches that after consecration, the bread and wine coexist with the body and blood of Christ in the eucharistic elements. While the term itself was rarely used by Martin Luther, it represents a distinctive Lutheran approach to the real presence of Christ in the sacrament that differs significantly from both the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the purely symbolic or memorial views held by some Protestant traditions.

## Historical Development

### Luther's Formulation

Martin Luther rejected the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation but insisted on Christ's real presence in the Eucharist:

- **Against Transubstantiation**: Luther argued against the Aristotelian categories used to explain transubstantiation, considering them unnecessary philosophical additions to scriptural teaching
- **Biblical Literalism**: Luther emphasized Christ's words, "This is my body" (Matthew 26:26), insisting they should be taken literally
- **Sacramental Union**: Luther preferred the term "sacramental union" (unio sacramentalis) to describe Christ's presence "in, with, and under" the bread and wine
- **Ubiquity**: Luther developed the doctrine of Christ's ubiquity (omnipresence) to explain how Christ's body could be present in multiple places simultaneously

### Reformation Context

The Eucharistic controversy was a central dispute during the Reformation:

- **Marburg Colloquy (1529)**: Luther and Zwingli's disagreement over the Eucharist prevented Protestant unity. Luther reportedly carved "This is my body" on the table to emphasize his literal reading
- **Colloquy of Worms (1540-1541)**: Attempted to reconcile Lutheran and Reformed views unsuccessfully
- **Formula of Concord (1577)**: Systematized Lutheran teaching, affirming that "the body and blood of Christ are truly and substantially present, offered, and received with the bread and wine"

### Post-Reformation Development

After the Reformation, the doctrine was further clarified:

- **Lutheran Orthodoxy**: 17th-century Lutheran theologians elaborated the doctrine using more technical language
- **Pietism**: Emphasized the spiritual benefits of communion while maintaining the real presence
- **Modern Lutheran Theology**: Continued to affirm the real presence while sometimes using different philosophical frameworks

## Theological Understanding

### Key Elements

The Lutheran understanding of the Eucharist includes several distinctive elements:

- **Real Presence**: Christ is truly and substantially present in the sacrament
- **In, With, and Under**: Christ's body and blood are present in, with, and under the bread and wine
- **Sacramental Union**: The union of Christ's body and blood with the bread and wine constitutes a unique type of union
- **No Change in Substance**: Unlike transubstantiation, the substances of bread and wine remain alongside Christ's body and blood
- **Mystery**: The mode of presence remains ultimately mysterious, not fully explicable by human reason

### Philosophical Underpinnings

While Luther rejected scholastic philosophy for explaining the Eucharist, later Lutheran theologians engaged philosophical concepts:

- **Rejection of Substance Metaphysics**: Luther criticized the Aristotelian substance-accident distinction used in transubstantiation
- **Communicatio Idiomatum**: The doctrine of communication of attributes between Christ's divine and human natures supported the ubiquity of Christ's body
- **Relational Ontology**: Some modern Lutheran theologians employ relational categories rather than substantial ones

### Scriptural Basis

Lutherans ground their teaching primarily in scripture:

- **Words of Institution**: Matthew 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 ("This is my body... This is my blood")
- **1 Corinthians 10:16**: "The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?"
- **1 Corinthians 11:27-29**: Paul warns against unworthy reception, implying a real presence
- **John 6:51-58**: Jesus speaks of eating his flesh and drinking his blood (though Lutherans often interpret this as primarily about faith rather than specifically about the Eucharist)

## Comparisons with Other Views

### Roman Catholic Transubstantiation

Key differences from the Catholic view include:

- **Substance of Elements**: In transubstantiation, the substances of bread and wine cease to exist; in Lutheran teaching, they remain
- **Philosophical Framework**: Catholicism employs Aristotelian substance-accident distinction; Lutheranism tends to avoid such philosophical categories
- **Duration of Presence**: Catholics teach that Christ's presence remains as long as the species of bread and wine remain; Lutherans generally limit it to the sacramental action
- **Adoration**: Most Lutherans reject eucharistic adoration outside the communion service
- **Valid Minister**: Lutherans eventually came to allow ordained pastors rather than exclusively priests in apostolic succession to consecrate

### Reformed "Spiritual Presence"

Differences from the Reformed (Calvinist) view include:

- **Nature of Presence**: Calvin taught a spiritual presence received by faith; Luther insisted on a bodily presence regardless of the faith of the recipient
- **Role of the Holy Spirit**: Calvin emphasized the Spirit's role in lifting communicants to heaven; Luther focused on Christ's descent into the elements
- **Christology**: Different understandings of how Christ's humanity relates to his divinity after the ascension
- **Receptionism**: Some Reformed traditions teach that Christ is present only to believers; Lutherans teach an objective presence
- **Manducatio Indignorum**: Lutherans affirm that unbelievers physically receive Christ's body and blood (to their judgment)

### Memorial Views

Differences from the memorial view (Zwinglian and Baptist traditions) include:

- **Nature of the Elements**: Memorial views see bread and wine as symbols only; Lutherans affirm a real presence
- **Purpose**: Memorialists emphasize remembrance; Lutherans emphasize receiving Christ
- **Spiritual Benefit**: For memorialists, benefits come through remembrance and faith; for Lutherans, benefits come through physical reception of Christ's body and blood
- **Christology**: Different understandings of Christ's bodily presence after the ascension

## Denominational Perspectives

### Lutheran Churches

Across Lutheran denominations, there are nuanced differences:

- **Confessional Lutherans**: Strictly adhere to the Formula of Concord's teaching
- **Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA)**: Maintains the doctrine while open to ecumenical dialogue
- **Lutheran Churchâ€“Missouri Synod (LCMS)**: Emphasizes the traditional Lutheran understanding
- **Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS)**: Maintains a strong confessional position
- **Scandinavian Lutheran Churches**: Generally maintain the teaching while sometimes placing less emphasis on doctrinal precision

### Ecumenical Reception

The doctrine has been discussed in ecumenical dialogues:

- **Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue**: The Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (1999) did not resolve eucharistic differences but opened doors for further dialogue
- **Leuenberg Agreement (1973)**: Lutheran and Reformed churches in Europe reached a level of mutual recognition despite differences in eucharistic theology
- **Porvoo Communion**: Agreement between Anglican and Lutheran churches in Northern Europe acknowledging different eucharistic theologies within a broader consensus

## Practical Implications

### Liturgical Practices

Lutheran eucharistic theology shapes liturgical practice:

- **Words of Institution**: Considered essential for valid celebration
- **Distribution Formula**: Often includes "The body of Christ, given for you"
- **Treatment of Elements**: Consecrated elements treated with reverence, but without practices like eucharistic processions
- **Frequency**: Historically quarterly or monthly, now often weekly in many churches
- **Reservation**: Generally do not reserve elements for adoration, though may reserve for the sick

### Pastoral Considerations

Practical applications include:

- **Preparation**: Emphasis on proper preparation through confession and examination
- **Closed/Open Communion**: Varying practices regarding who may receive communion
- **Common Cup vs. Individual Cups**: Both practices exist in Lutheran churches
- **Intinction**: Some congregations practice intinction (dipping bread in wine)
- **Disposal of Elements**: Typically consumed entirely or disposed of reverently

## Contemporary Issues

### Modern Theological Discussion

Contemporary Lutheran theologians have revisited the doctrine:

- **Relational Approaches**: Some theologians emphasize relational rather than substantive categories
- **Ecumenical Considerations**: Seeking common ground with other traditions while maintaining distinctives
- **Scientific Worldview**: Addressing how the doctrine relates to modern scientific understandings
- **Phenomenological Approaches**: Using categories of experience rather than metaphysics
- **Sacramental Semiotics**: Exploring the meaning-making aspect of the sacrament

### Ongoing Questions

Areas of ongoing discussion include:

- **Terminology**: Whether "consubstantiation" accurately describes Lutheran teaching
- **Ecumenical Reconciliation**: How to bridge differences with other eucharistic theologies
- **Contemporary Relevance**: Communicating the doctrine in today's context
- **Physical/Metaphysical**: Clarifying what is meant by "physical" presence
- **Sacramental Efficacy**: The relationship between Christ's presence and the benefits received
