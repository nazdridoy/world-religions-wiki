# Christian Bioethics

![Christian perspectives on medical ethics](bioethics.jpg)

Christian bioethics addresses the moral dimensions of medicine, healthcare, biotechnology, and the life sciences through theological reflection on human nature, creation, and divine purpose. While Christians share many foundational values, they often reach different conclusions about specific bioethical issues based on their theological traditions, interpretive frameworks, and understandings of moral reasoning.

## Theological Foundations

Central to Christian bioethics is the belief that humans are created in God's image (Genesis 1:26-27):

Christian bioethics draws on creation theology:

- Respect for natural processes while acknowledging fallenness
- Appropriate use of technology without overreaching
