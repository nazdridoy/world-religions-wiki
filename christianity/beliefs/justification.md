# Justification

![Justification in Christian theology](justification.jpg)

Justification in Christian theology refers to the act by which sinful humans are made righteous in God's sight. This doctrine addresses one of the fundamental questions of Christianity: "How can sinful humans be in right relationship with a holy God?" As a core component of soteriology (salvation), justification has been interpreted differently across various Christian traditions.

## Biblical Foundations

### Old Testament Background

The concept of justification has roots in Old Testament legal language:

- **Hebrew term *tsadaq***: To declare righteous, vindicate
- **Covenant relationship**: Israel's standing with God
- **Deuteronomy 25:1**: Judges "justifying" the righteous and condemning the wicked
- **Genesis 15:6**: "Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness"
- **Psalm 143:2**: "Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you"
- **Habakkuk 2:4**: "The righteous person will live by his faithfulness"

### Pauline Development

The Apostle Paul provided the most extensive treatment of justification:

- **Romans 3:21-26**: Justification as a gift by grace through faith in Christ
- **Romans 4**: Abraham's justification by faith as paradigm
- **Romans 5:1-2**: "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God"
- **Galatians 2:16**: "A person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ"
- **Philippians 3:9**: "Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ"

### Other New Testament Perspectives

- **James 2:14-26**: Emphasis on works as evidence of faith ("faith without works is dead")
- **Matthew 12:37**: "For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned"
- **Luke 18:9-14**: Parable of the Pharisee and tax collector highlighting true justification
- **Acts 13:38-39**: "Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses"

## Historical Development

### Early Church Period

The early church fathers did not systematically develop the doctrine of justification:

- **Clement of Rome** (late 1st century): Emphasized both faith and works
- **Justin Martyr** (c.100-165): Focused on forgiveness and transformation
- **Origen** (c.185-254): Developed concept of righteousness bestowed by Christ
- **John Chrysostom** (c.347-407): Highlighted God's mercy as basis for justification

### Augustine's Influence

Augustine (354-430) significantly shaped Western understanding:

- Emphasized grace as foundation for justification
- Viewed justification as transformation making one intrinsically righteous
- Taught that faith itself is a gift of grace
- Laid groundwork for later Catholic development

### Medieval Scholasticism

Scholastic theologians refined understandings of justification:

- **Thomas Aquinas** (1225-1274): Justification as:
  - Infusion of grace to remove sin and impart righteousness
  - Including forgiveness and sanctification
  - Requiring human cooperation while maintaining primacy of grace
- **Gabriel Biel** (c.1420-1495): More emphasis on human contribution

### Reformation Period

Justification became the central issue of the Protestant Reformation:

- **Martin Luther** (1483-1546):
  - "The article by which the church stands or falls"
  - Forensic (legal) declaration of righteousness
  - Imputation of Christ's righteousness
  - Faith alone (*sola fide*) as means of reception
  - Distinction between justification and sanctification

- **John Calvin** (1509-1564):
  - "Double grace" of justification and sanctification
  - Emphasis on union with Christ as basis
  - Maintained forensic understanding
  - Connected to predestination

- **Council of Trent** (1545-1563):
  - Catholic response rejecting *sola fide*
  - Justification as renewal, not merely declaration
  - Infusion of righteousness, not merely imputation
  - Maintained role for human cooperation

## Theological Dimensions

### Key Concepts

Several theological concepts relate to understanding justification:

- **Imputation**: Crediting Christ's righteousness to believer's account
- **Impartation**: Actual infusion of righteousness into the believer
- **Forensic/Legal**: Declaration of righteous status
- **Transformative**: Actual change in moral character
- **Objective**: Changes one's standing before God
- **Subjective**: Changes one's internal state
- **Synthetic**: Adding something not previously present
- **Analytic**: Recognizing what is already present

### Relationship to Other Doctrines

Justification connects with numerous theological concepts:

- **Atonement**: The basis for justification in Christ's work
- **Faith**: The instrument or means of justification
- **Grace**: The source and character of justification
- **Sanctification**: The relationship between justification and holy living
- **Election**: God's sovereign choice in salvation
- **Perseverance**: The permanence of justified status
- **Assurance**: Confidence in one's justified state

### Theological Questions

Key disputed questions include:

- Is justification a one-time event or ongoing process?
- Is it declarative or transformative?
- What is the relationship between faith and works?
- Is justification reversible?
- What is the timing of justification in the ordo salutis (order of salvation)?

## Denominational Perspectives

### Roman Catholic View

- Justification involves both forgiveness and sanctification
- Initial justification received through baptism
- Process that increases through sacraments and cooperation with grace
- Can be lost through mortal sin and restored through penance
- Final justification dependent on faithfulness and grace
- Based on Christ's merit but involves real transformation

### Lutheran Understanding

- Forensic declaration of righteousness
- Alien righteousness of Christ imputed to believer
- Faith alone as instrument of reception
- Distinct from but always accompanied by sanctification
- Simul justus et peccator (simultaneously justified and sinner)
- Preserved by grace alone through faith alone

### Reformed/Presbyterian Perspective

- Similar to Lutheran view in many respects
- Strong emphasis on union with Christ as basis
- Connected to God's eternal decree of election
- Effective calling precedes faith and justification
- Perseverance of the justified guaranteed

### Wesleyan/Methodist Approach

- Forensic understanding but with transformative elements
- Prevenient grace enabling response to gospel
- Justification by faith alone but not by faith that is alone
- Possibility of falling from justified state
- Strong emphasis on sanctification following justification

### Eastern Orthodox View

- Less emphasis on juridical concepts
- Focus on participation in divine life (theosis)
- Salvation as process rather than moment
- Baptism as initiation into justified community
- Synergistic cooperation between divine grace and human freedom

### Contemporary Evangelical Views

- Generally follows Reformation understanding
- Varied positions on role of works and assurance
- New Perspective on Paul has influenced some
- Increased attention to narrative and participatory dimensions

## Contemporary Discussions

### Ecumenical Developments

- **Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification** (1999):
  - Agreement between Lutheran World Federation and Roman Catholic Church
  - Later joined by World Methodist Council (2006), Anglican Communion (2016), and World Communion of Reformed Churches (2017)
  - Acknowledges complementary emphases while affirming core agreement
  - Recognizes remaining differences in articulation

### New Perspective on Paul

Scholarly movement beginning in late 20th century:

- **E.P. Sanders**: "Covenantal nomism" in Second Temple Judaism
- **James D.G. Dunn**: Justification as covenant inclusion
- **N.T. Wright**: God's covenant faithfulness and eschatological vindication
- Challenges to traditional Protestant readings of Paul
- Emphasis on social and ecclesiological dimensions

### Recent Theological Trends

- Renewed interest in union with Christ as framework
- Integration of justification into broader narrative of salvation
- Participatory models complementing forensic understanding
- Increased focus on eschatological dimensions
- Attention to social implications of justification
