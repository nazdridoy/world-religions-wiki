# Ascension of Jesus

![Ascension of Jesus depicted in Christian art](ascension.jpg)

The Ascension refers to the bodily rising of the resurrected Jesus Christ into heaven, occurring 40 days after his resurrection. Described in the New Testament and affirmed in the historic creeds, this event marks the culmination of Christ's earthly ministry and his exaltation to the right hand of God. The Ascension holds significant theological implications for Christian understanding of Christ's ongoing role, the Holy Spirit's coming, and the church's mission.

## Biblical Accounts

### New Testament Descriptions

The Ascension is explicitly described in two New Testament passages:

- **Luke 24:50-53**: "When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God."

- **Acts 1:9-11**: "After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight. They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. 'Men of Galilee,' they said, 'why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.'"

### Additional References

Other New Testament texts refer to the Ascension indirectly:

- **Mark 16:19**: "After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God." (Note: This appears in the longer ending of Mark, which some scholars consider a later addition)
- **John 20:17**: Jesus tells Mary Magdalene: "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father."
- **Ephesians 4:8-10**: "When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people."
- **1 Timothy 3:16**: "He appeared in the flesh...was taken up in glory."
- **Hebrews 4:14**: "Since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God..."
- **1 Peter 3:22**: "Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand..."

- Medieval understanding of the celestial spheres
- Modern scientific cosmology and its challenges to literal interpretations
- Theological concepts of heaven as a dimension rather than a location
- Relationship between physical and spiritual realities

### Traditional Artistic Depictions

Christian art has portrayed the Ascension in distinctive ways:

## Contemporary Theological Approaches
