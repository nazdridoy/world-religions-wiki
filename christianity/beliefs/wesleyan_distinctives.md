# Wesleyan Distinctives

![Wesleyan tradition](wesleyan_distinctives.jpg)

Wesleyan theology, named after 18th-century Anglican priest John Wesley (1703-1791), represents a significant theological tradition within Protestant Christianity. This theological perspective, which forms the foundation for Methodist and Holiness denominations, offers distinctive emphases regarding salvation, sanctification, grace, and Christian living. While maintaining core Protestant and evangelical commitments, Wesleyan theology provides unique contributions through its optimistic view of grace, emphasis on holiness, and integration of personal and social dimensions of the Christian faith.

## Historical Foundation

### John Wesley's Context

The Wesleyan tradition emerged from several historical influences:

- **Anglican Roots**: Wesley remained an Anglican priest throughout his life
- **Moravian Influence**: Wesley's "heartwarming" experience at Aldersgate followed contact with Moravian pietists
- **English Reformation**: Built upon Protestant doctrines of sola scriptura and salvation by grace through faith
- **Catholic Heritage**: Retained emphasis on sacraments and historical church continuity
- **Enlightenment Era**: Responded to rationalism with emphasis on experience and practical divinity
- **Revivalism**: Developed through field preaching and Methodist revival movement
- **Social Context**: Addressed industrialization's impact on working classes

### Methodist Movement Development

The movement Wesley founded evolved through several stages:
- **Holy Club** at Oxford (1729): Focus on disciplined Christian living
- **Wesley's Conversion** (1738): New emphasis on faith and assurance
- **Field Preaching** (1739 onward): Evangelistic outreach beyond parish boundaries
- **Class Meetings** (1740s): Small accountability groups for spiritual growth
- **Conference System** (1744): Organization of preachers and societies
- **Doctrinal Standardization**: Wesley's sermons and Notes on the New Testament became doctrinal standards
- **American Methodist Church** (1784): Independent denomination with adapted Anglican structures

## Theological Distinctives

### Arminian Soteriology

Wesleyan theology embraces an Arminian understanding of salvation:

- **Universal Atonement**: Christ died for all people, not just the elect
- **Resistible Grace**: Divine grace can be freely accepted or rejected
- **Conditional Election**: God's election based on foreknowledge of faith response
- **Cooperative Salvation**: Synergistic view of divine grace and human response
- **Possibility of Apostasy**: Salvation can be lost through persistent rejection of God
- **Corporate Election**: Election primarily of the church with individuals participating through faith
- **Inclusive Scope**: Salvation potentially available to all humanity

### Prevenient Grace

Wesley's concept of prevenient (preceding) grace is foundational:

- **Universal Bestowal**: Given to all people regardless of awareness
- **Awakening Function**: Overcomes total depravity enough to enable response
- **Conscience**: Explains moral awareness in all people
- **Preparation**: Enables initial movements toward God before saving faith
- **Resistible Nature**: Can be rejected by human free will
- **Inclusive Work**: Operates even among those without Gospel knowledge
- **Continuous Operation**: Works throughout life, not just at conversion point

### Transformation Emphasis

Wesleyan theology uniquely emphasizes personal transformation:

- **New Birth**: Conversion as genuine regeneration of the heart
- **Assurance**: Direct witness of the Holy Spirit to adopted status
- **Entire Sanctification**: Complete devotion to God possible in this life
- **Christian Perfection**: Perfect love fulfilling the law's intent
- **Growth in Grace**: Ongoing maturation in Christian character
- **Heart Religion**: Inward reality rather than mere external observance
- **Character Formation**: Development of Christlike virtues

### Holiness Theology

The pursuit of holiness is distinctively Wesleyan:

- **Sanctification as Process and Crisis**: Both gradual growth and decisive moments
- **Attainable Holiness**: Real, substantial growth in holiness possible in this life
- **Perfect Love**: Love for God and neighbor as the essence of holiness
- **Cleansing from Sin**: Freedom from willful sin and sinful attitudes
- **Filled with the Spirit**: Emphasis on Spirit's empowerment for holy living
- **Pure Intention**: Single-minded devotion to God
- **Enacted Holiness**: Faith expressed through works of mercy and justice

### Means of Grace

Wesley emphasized practices that mediate divine grace:

- **Instituted Means**: Practices ordained by Christ (prayer, Scripture, communion, fasting, Christian conference)
- **Prudential Means**: Practices helpful but not mandated (class meetings, love feasts, watchnight services)
- **Works of Piety**: Spiritual disciplines directed toward God
- **Works of Mercy**: Actions of compassion directed toward others
- **General Means**: Background attitudes of watchfulness, denying self, taking up cross, exercise of presence of God
- **Sacramental Emphasis**: Communion as converting, confirming, and sanctifying ordinance
- **Balanced Approach**: Avoidance of formalism and enthusiasm extremes

### Social Holiness

Wesleyan theology integrates personal and social dimensions:

- **No Holiness But Social Holiness**: Sanctification occurs in community context
- **Interconnection**: Personal transformation and social reform inseparably linked
- **Practical Divinity**: Theology expressed in concrete social action
- **Justice Ministry**: Opposition to slavery, poverty, and exploitation
- **Stewardship**: Responsible use of resources for others' benefit
- **Social Principles**: Application of biblical ethics to social issues
- **Structural Reform**: Addressing systems as well as individual behavior

## Theological Method

### Wesleyan Quadrilateral

While not Wesley's term, this describes his theological approach:

- **Scripture**: Primary authority for doctrine and practice

These sources function together with Scripture as the controlling norm.
