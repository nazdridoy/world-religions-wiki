Worship represents the central act of Christian faith, the response of the created to the Creator, and the communal expression of devotion to God. Throughout Christian history, theological understanding of worship has developed across traditions, reflecting diverse perspectives on its nature, purpose, elements, and proper forms. At its core, Christian worship involves recognition of God's worth and humanity's appropriate response.

## Biblical Foundations

### Old Testament Roots

The Hebrew Bible establishes patterns that shape Christian worship:

### New Testament Developments

The early church transformed worship understanding through Christ:

- **Jesus' Teaching**: Worship in "spirit and truth" (John 4:23-24)

> "Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks." (John 4:23)
