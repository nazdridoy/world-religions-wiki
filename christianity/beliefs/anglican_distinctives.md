![Anglican worship](anglican_distinctives.jpg)

Anglicanism represents a distinctive tradition within Christianity that emerged from the English Reformation, characterized by its unique "middle way" (via media) between Roman Catholicism and continental Protestantism. While encompassing significant theological diversity, Anglicanism maintains distinctive approaches to authority, worship, theology, and ecclesiology that have shaped its identity across the worldwide Anglican Communion, which today includes approximately 85 million members in 165 countries.

## Historical Foundation

### English Reformation Context

The Church of England's reformation followed a unique trajectory:

- **Political Origins**: Henry VIII's break with Rome in 1534 (Act of Supremacy) established royal supremacy
- **Moderate Reform**: Initial preservation of Catholic doctrine with rejection of papal authority
- **Protestant Influence**: Under Edward VI (1547-1553), reforms advanced with Protestant theology
- **Catholic Reaction**: Mary I (1553-1558) briefly restored Roman Catholicism
- **Elizabethan Settlement**: Elizabeth I established via media that balanced Catholic and Reformed elements
- **Book of Common Prayer**: Thomas Cranmer's liturgical work formalized distinctive Anglican worship
- **Thirty-Nine Articles**: Established doctrinal framework allowing theological breadth

### Subsequent Development

Anglican identity developed through several key phases:
- **Caroline Divines** (17th century): Refined Anglican theology emphasizing patristic sources
- **Oxford Movement** (19th century): Catholic revival emphasizing sacraments and apostolic succession
- **Evangelical Revival**: Emphasized personal conversion and biblical authority
- **Liberal Modernism**: Engaged with critical scholarship and modern thought
- **Global Expansion**: Colonial missions established Anglican churches worldwide
- **Anglican Communion**: Development of global fellowship of autonomous churches
