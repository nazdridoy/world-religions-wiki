# Divine Love

![Divine Love](divine_love.jpg)

Divine love (agape) is a foundational attribute of God in Christian theology that describes God's unconditional, self-giving nature. More than an emotion or sentiment, divine love is understood as the very essence of God's character, expressed in the New Testament declaration that "God is love" (1 John 4:8, 16).

## Biblical Foundation

The concept of divine love permeates Scripture:

### Old Testament
- God's steadfast love (hesed) for Israel despite their unfaithfulness: "I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness" (Jeremiah 31:3)
- God's compassionate, fatherly love: "As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him" (Psalm 103:13)
- God's covenant love that remains faithful: "The LORD appeared to us in the past, saying: 'I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness'" (Jeremiah 31:3)

### New Testament
- God's love demonstrated through Christ's sacrifice: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16)
- Divine love as the essence of God's nature: "God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them" (1 John 4:16)
- Love as the greatest commandment: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind...Love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 22:37-39)

## Theological Understanding

### Nature of Divine Love

Christian theology understands divine love to be:

1. **Unconditional** - Not based on the merit or worthiness of the recipient
2. **Sacrificial** - Willing to give of itself for the good of others, supremely demonstrated in Christ's crucifixion
3. **Universal** - Extending to all creation, though experienced differently based on relationship
4. **Transformative** - Changes the recipient through encounter
5. **Eternal** - Without beginning or end, as an essential attribute of God's nature
6. **Perfect** - Complete and without deficiency or flaw
7. **Active** - Not merely a feeling but expresses itself in action and relationship

### Trinitarian Perspective

Within the Trinity, divine love exists eternally as the mutual self-giving relationship between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This intra-Trinitarian love overflows into creation, redemption, and sanctification. The Father loves the Son (John 3:35), the Son loves the Father (John 14:31), and the Spirit manifests this love in believers (Romans 5:5).

## Historical Development

### Patristic Period
Early church fathers like Clement of Alexandria and Augustine emphasized God's love as primary among divine attributes. Augustine particularly connected love to the Trinity, seeing the Holy Spirit as the personification of the love between Father and Son.

### Medieval Period
Thomas Aquinas defined love as willing the good of another, teaching that God's love is the source of all goodness in creation. Medieval mystics like Julian of Norwich highlighted God's maternal love, emphasizing divine tenderness and care.

### Reformation
Reformers like Luther and Calvin emphasized God's loving grace in salvation, though they maintained this love operates differently toward the elect versus non-elect. Calvin particularly struggled with harmonizing divine love with predestination.

### Modern Period
In the 20th century, theologians like Karl Barth recentered theology on God's love revealed in Christ, while Anders Nygren distinguished between agape (divine, self-giving love) and eros (human, acquisitive love).

## Denominational Perspectives

### Roman Catholic
Catholic theology emphasizes divine love as expressed through the sacraments and enacted in charity (caritas). The encyclical Deus Caritas Est (God Is Love) by Pope Benedict XVI explores the relationship between divine love, human love, and service.

### Eastern Orthodox
Orthodox theology emphasizes divine love as an energizing, transformative power through which humans can participate in theosis (divinization). God's love is understood as both transcendent mystery and immanent presence.

### Protestant
Protestant traditions generally emphasize divine love shown in Christ's atoning sacrifice and God's gracious forgiveness. Various traditions differ in how they reconcile divine love with God's justice, wrath, and sovereignty.

### Evangelical
Evangelical theology typically emphasizes God's personal love for each individual and the need to receive and respond to this love through faith in Christ.

## Theological Tensions

Several theological tensions surround divine love:

1. **Divine Love and Divine Wrath**: How God's love relates to divine judgment and wrath
2. **Universal Love and Particular Salvation**: How God's love for all relates to the salvation of some
3. **Divine Love and Human Freedom**: Whether God's love coerces or respects freedom
4. **Love and Justice**: How divine love relates to God's justice and righteousness
5. **Impassibility and Love**: Whether God's love involves emotional response or remains unchanging

## Contemporary Applications

Contemporary Christian approaches to divine love include:

- **Liberation Theology**: Emphasizes God's preferential love for the poor and oppressed
- **Feminist Theology**: Recovers feminine and maternal metaphors for divine love
- **Process Theology**: Portrays divine love as God's participation in the world's suffering
- **Relational Theology**: Emphasizes love as the core of God's relational nature
- **Public Theology**: Applies divine love to social justice concerns and communal ethics
