# The Resurrection of Jesus Christ

![Depiction of the resurrection of Jesus](resurrection.jpg)

The resurrection of Jesus Christ—his bodily rising from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion—stands as the central claim of Christianity. This unprecedented event forms the cornerstone of Christian faith, without which, as the Apostle Paul wrote, "our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain" (1 Corinthians 15:14). Christians throughout history have affirmed that Jesus' resurrection validates his divine identity, confirms his sacrificial work on the cross, and promises the future resurrection of believers.

## Biblical Accounts

The New Testament contains multiple accounts of Jesus' resurrection with varying details:

### Gospel Narratives

Each Gospel records the resurrection with distinctive emphases:

- **Matthew 28**: Describes an earthquake, an angel rolling away the stone, guards becoming "like dead men," Jesus appearing to women and later to disciples on a mountain in Galilee
- **Mark 16**: The earliest manuscripts end at 16:8 with women fleeing in fear; the longer ending records appearances to Mary Magdalene, two disciples, and the Eleven
- **Luke 24**: Details the women finding the empty tomb, Jesus' appearance on the Emmaus road, his appearance to the disciples showing his wounds and eating fish
- **John 20-21**: Recounts Mary Magdalene's discovery of the empty tomb, Peter and John verifying it, Jesus appearing to Mary, the disciples (twice, including doubting Thomas), and later by the Sea of Galilee

### Pauline Testimony

Paul provides the earliest written resurrection testimony:

- **1 Corinthians 15:3-8**: Written around 55 CE, lists appearances to Peter, the Twelve, over 500 at once, James, all the apostles, and finally to Paul himself
- **Romans 1:4**: Jesus "was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead"
- **Philippians 3:10-11**: Expresses Paul's desire to know "the power of his resurrection"

### Features of the Accounts

Common elements across biblical accounts include:

- Women as first witnesses, despite their testimony being culturally devalued
- The empty tomb discovered on the first day of the week
- Initial disbelief by the disciples
- Physical interactions with the risen Jesus (eating, touching)
- Transformation of dejected disciples into bold witnesses
- Commission to proclaim the resurrection message

## Historical Evidence

### Early Testimony

The historical case for the resurrection includes:

- **Early Creedal Formulations**: 1 Corinthians 15:3-5 contains what scholars recognize as a pre-Pauline creed dating to within a few years of the events
- **Established Timeline**: Crucifixion around 30-33 CE, with resurrection proclamation beginning immediately afterward
- **Multiple Attestation**: Various independent sources reporting the event
- **Enemy Attestation**: Early counter-explanations acknowledged the empty tomb

### Historical Facts

Scholars, including many non-Christians, generally acknowledge:

- Jesus of Nazareth died by Roman crucifixion
- His followers sincerely believed he appeared to them after death
- Former skeptics like James (Jesus' brother) and Paul became believers
- The empty tomb (though some dispute this)

### Alternative Explanations

Non-supernatural explanations have included:

- **Theft Theory**: Disciples stole the body (earliest counter-explanation, Matthew 28:11-15)
