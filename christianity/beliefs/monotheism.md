# Monotheism

![Christian monotheism](monotheism.jpg)

Monotheism—the belief in one and only one God—forms the essential foundation of Christian theology. While Christianity professes faith in the triune God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), it firmly maintains that there is only one divine being. This understanding of God as singular yet triune sets Christianity apart from both polytheistic religions and other monotheistic faiths.

## Biblical Foundations

### Old Testament Witness

The Hebrew Bible/Old Testament presents a clear monotheistic vision that Christianity inherits:

- **Shema**: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4)
- **First Commandment**: "You shall have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3)
- **Isaiah's declarations**: "Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me" (Isaiah 43:10)
- **Exclusive worship**: Repeated prohibitions against idolatry (Exodus 20:4-6, Psalm 115:4-8)
- **Creation account**: One God as creator of all (Genesis 1-2)
- **Divine uniqueness**: "Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods?" (Exodus 15:11)

### New Testament Affirmation

The New Testament maintains strict monotheism while introducing Trinitarian dimensions:

- **Jesus affirming the Shema**: "The Lord our God, the Lord is one" (Mark 12:29)
- **Pauline statements**: "There is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus" (1 Timothy 2:5)
- **James' declaration**: "You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!" (James 2:19)
- **John's writings**: Affirming both God's oneness and Christ's divinity (John 1:1-18, 10:30)
- **One God, many false gods**: "For although there may be so-called gods... yet for us there is one God" (1 Corinthians 8:5-6)

## Historical Development

### Early Church Context

The early church developed its monotheistic understanding in multiple religious contexts:

- **Jewish monotheism**: Christianity emerged from Judaism's strict monotheism
- **Greco-Roman polytheism**: Christians rejected the pantheon of gods as false deities
- **Gnosticism**: Christians opposed dualistic systems positing multiple divine beings
- **Imperial cult**: Christians refused to acknowledge the emperor as divine
- **Philosophical monotheism**: Christians engaged with Platonic and Stoic conceptions of the divine

### Patristic Formulations

Early church fathers worked to articulate Christian monotheism:

- **Justin Martyr** (c.100-165): Defended Christian worship of one God against charges of atheism
- **Irenaeus** (c.130-202): Opposed Gnostic systems with multiple divine beings
- **Tertullian** (c.155-220): Developed trinitarian language while maintaining "one substance"
- **Athanasius** (c.296-373): Defended Christ's full deity without compromising monotheism
- **Augustine** (354-430): Advanced sophisticated philosophical monotheism

### Medieval Developments

Medieval theology further refined monotheistic understanding:

- **Scholastic precision**: Thomas Aquinas's "Five Ways" as proofs for one God
- **Divine simplicity**: God as absolutely one and indivisible
- **Trinitarian formulations**: Maintaining divine unity while affirming three persons
- **Engagement with Islam**: Theological dialogue with another monotheistic faith
- **Mystical writings**: Emphasizing union with the one God

## Theological Dimensions

### Key Attributes of the One God

Christian monotheism affirms distinctive divine attributes:

1. **Unity**: God is absolutely one, without parts or division
2. **Uniqueness**: Only one being possesses divine nature
3. **Self-existence**: God alone exists independently
4. **Sovereignty**: Supreme authority over all creation
5. **Omnipotence**: All power belongs to God alone
6. **Omniscience**: God alone knows all things
7. **Omnipresence**: God alone is present everywhere
8. **Eternity**: God alone is without beginning or end
9. **Creator**: The one source of all that exists
10. **Transcendence**: God is wholly other than creation

### Monotheism and Trinity

Christianity's unique contribution to monotheism is maintaining that the one God exists eternally as three persons:

- **Not three Gods**: The Trinity is not a form of tritheism or polytheism
- **Shared essence**: Father, Son, and Spirit share one divine nature
- **Eternal relations**: The three persons exist in eternal relationship
- **Economic functions**: Different roles in creation and redemption
- **Mystery**: Full comprehension exceeds human understanding

As Gregory of Nyssa (c.335-395) explained:
> "When we look at the Godhead, at the first person, the single nature of the being, undivided and unseparated, we are drawn to the idea of one God. But when we look at the persons, at the communication within the being of the Godhead... we contemplate the three persons."

### Monotheism and Christology

The incarnation presents unique questions for monotheism:

- **Hypostatic union**: How Christ can be fully divine and fully human
- **Communication of attributes**: How divine properties relate to Christ's humanity
- **Worship of Christ**: How monotheism allows worship of Jesus
- **Mediatorial role**: Christ as the one mediator between God and humanity
- **Second person**: Christ's eternal existence within the one Godhead

## Comparative Religious Perspectives

### Relation to Judaism

Judaism and Christianity share monotheistic roots but differ significantly:

- **Common heritage**: Both faiths revere the Shema and affirm one God
- **Trinity**: Christians affirm Trinity while Jews reject it as compromising monotheism
- **Incarnation**: Christians affirm God becoming human, which Judaism rejects
- **Historical development**: Christian views of God developed from Jewish foundations
- **Covenant theology**: Different understandings of God's relationship with humanity

### Relation to Islam

Islam and Christianity both profess monotheism but with fundamental differences:

- **Tawhid vs. Trinity**: Islamic absolute oneness versus Christian Trinitarian understanding
- **Christology**: Christians affirm Christ's divinity while Islam rejects it as shirk (associating partners with God)
- **Revelation**: Different understandings of how God reveals himself
- **Transcendence**: Islam emphasizes God's utter transcendence more than immanence
- **Common elements**: Both affirm God as creator, sovereign, and judge

### Distinctive Emphases

Christian monotheism has several distinctive features compared to other monotheistic traditions:

- **Trinitarian**: One God in three persons
- **Incarnational**: God became human in Christ
- **Relational**: God's nature involves eternal relationship
- **Sacrificial**: God's self-giving nature revealed in Christ
- **Universally accessible**: Direct relationship with God available to all

## Historical Challenges

### Alternative Systems

Throughout history, Christianity has defined its monotheism against:

- **Polytheism**: Belief in multiple gods
- **Henotheism**: Worship of one god while acknowledging others
- **Pantheism**: Identifying God with the universe
- **Panentheism**: God encompasses but exceeds the universe
- **Deism**: God creates but remains uninvolved
- **Atheism**: Denial of God's existence
- **Agnosticism**: Uncertainty about God's existence

### Internal Heresies

Christian monotheism was refined through rejecting several heterodox views:

- **Arianism**: Christ as created and subordinate to God
- **Modalism**: Father, Son, and Spirit as temporary modes of one person
- **Tritheism**: Father, Son, and Spirit as three separate deities
- **Adoptionism**: Jesus as human who became divine
- **Docetism**: Christ only appeared human but was purely divine

## Contemporary Significance

### Interfaith Relations

Christian monotheism shapes interreligious dialogue:

- **Abrahamic faiths**: Finding common ground with Jews and Muslims
- **Polytheistic traditions**: Fundamental differences with Hindu and traditional religions
- **Non-theistic systems**: Dialogue with Buddhist and secular worldviews
- **New religious movements**: Evaluating modern spiritual concepts
- **Syncretism**: Determining boundaries of authentic Christian belief

### Secularism and Pluralism

In contemporary pluralistic societies, Christian monotheism faces challenges:

- **Religious pluralism**: Claims that all religions worship the same God
- **Secular critiques**: Monotheism accused of intolerance or exclusivism
- **Postmodern skepticism**: Questioning universal truth claims
- **Cultural relativism**: Seeing religious beliefs as merely cultural constructs
- **Scientific materialism**: Challenging supernatural dimensions of faith

### Practical Application

Monotheism shapes Christian life and practice:

- **Worship**: Directed exclusively to the one true God
- **Prayer**: Confident access to the one sovereign Lord
- **Ethics**: Moral standards based on one God's character
- **Mission**: Proclaiming the one true God to all people
- **Social witness**: Standing against idolatry in various forms
- **Spiritual formation**: Growing in relationship with the one God
