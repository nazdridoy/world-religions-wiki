# Apostolic Succession

![Apostolic succession illustration](apostolic_succession.jpg)

Apostolic succession is the doctrine that maintains the unbroken line of authority passed down from the apostles to their successors, the bishops, through the laying on of hands. This theological concept forms a foundational element for ecclesial authority in several Christian traditions, particularly Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and to varying degrees, Anglicanism.

## Historical Development

### Biblical Foundations

The concept of apostolic succession has its roots in several biblical passages:

- **Acts 1:15-26**: The apostles select Matthias to replace Judas, establishing a precedent for apostolic continuity
- **Acts 14:23**: Paul and Barnabas appoint elders (presbyters) in the churches they establish
- **1 Timothy 4:14**: "Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders"
- **2 Timothy 1:6**: "For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands"
- **Titus 1:5**: Paul instructs Titus to "appoint elders in every town, as I directed you"

### Patristic Development

The doctrine was systematically articulated by early Church Fathers:

- **Clement of Rome** (c. 96 CE): In his letter to the Corinthians, he described how the apostles appointed their "first fruits" as bishops and deacons
- **Ignatius of Antioch** (c. 110 CE): Emphasized the role of the bishop as the center of unity for the local church
- **Irenaeus of Lyon** (c. 180 CE): In "Against Heresies," developed the concept of apostolic succession as a safeguard against heresy, providing lists of bishops tracing back to the apostles
- **Tertullian** (c. 200 CE): Before his Montanist period, argued for the authority of churches founded by apostles
- **Cyprian of Carthage** (c. 250 CE): Elaborated on the college of bishops as successors to the college of apostles

## Theological Understanding

### Roman Catholic View

The Roman Catholic Church maintains that:

- Christ established a hierarchical church with the apostles at its head
- Peter was given primacy among the apostles (Matthew 16:18-19)
- The apostles consecrated bishops to succeed them
- An unbroken line of succession from the apostles continues through the proper ordination of bishops
- Valid ordination requires:
  - A properly ordained bishop as ordainer
  - The proper matter and form (laying on of hands and proper prayer)
  - The proper intention
- This succession guarantees the validity of sacraments and authentic teaching authority

### Eastern Orthodox View

Eastern Orthodoxy holds that:

- Apostolic succession involves not merely a linear succession of individuals but the preservation of the apostolic faith
- The whole church, not just the hierarchy, is the guardian of tradition
- Bishops function properly only when acting in harmony with the entire episcopate
- Succession must be accompanied by communion with the universal episcopate
- The entire church community plays a role in recognizing authentic succession
- Apostolic succession guarantees sacramental validity and doctrinal continuity

### Anglican View

The Anglican Communion maintains:

- Adherence to the historic episcopate as "a symbol of the Church's continuity with the apostolic witness"
- The Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral (1886/1888) affirms the historic episcopate as one of four essential elements of church unity
- Varied interpretations exist within Anglicanism regarding the necessity of apostolic succession for sacramental validity
- The issue was complicated by the Reformation and subsequent consecrations
- The validity of Anglican orders has been questioned by Rome (Apostolicae Curae, 1896) but affirmed by Old Catholics and some Orthodox hierarchs

### Protestant Perspectives

Protestant denominations generally have diverse views:

- **Lutheran**: Some branches maintain episcopal succession; others emphasize succession of apostolic teaching rather than personal lineage
- **Reformed/Presbyterian**: Focus on succession of doctrine rather than episcopal lineage; authority resides in the community of elders
- **Methodist**: Maintained episcopal structure but with mixed views on its necessity
- **Baptist/Free Church**: Reject the necessity of episcopal succession, emphasizing the priesthood of all believers and local church autonomy
- **Pentecostal**: Generally emphasize spiritual succession through the gifts of the Spirit rather than institutional succession

## Theological Significance

### Ecclesiological Implications

Apostolic succession has significant implications for ecclesiology:

- Defines the relationship between the universal and local church
- Establishes parameters for valid sacramental ministry
- Provides a framework for church authority
- Influences understandings of church unity and division
- Shapes approaches to ecumenical dialogue

### Sacramental Implications

The doctrine directly impacts sacramental theology:

- For traditions emphasizing apostolic succession, valid ordination requires bishops in apostolic succession
- This in turn affects the validity of sacraments requiring ordained ministers
- Questions arise regarding the status of sacraments in communities without apostolic succession
- The concept of economy allows for pastoral flexibility in some traditional churches

### Unity and Division

The doctrine has been both:

- A point of unity, maintaining institutional continuity across centuries
- A source of division, becoming a barrier between churches with different understandings of succession
- A focus of ecumenical dialogue, seeking common ground on authority and ministry

## Contemporary Issues

### Ecumenical Developments

Recent ecumenical dialogues have addressed apostolic succession:

- The Lima Document (Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry, 1982) acknowledged diverse understandings while affirming the importance of apostolic tradition
- Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC) has extensively discussed mutual recognition of ministry
- Lutheran-Catholic dialogue has made progress in understanding apostolic ministry
- Methodist-Catholic dialogue has addressed episcopal succession
- Orthodox-Catholic dialogues continue to explore primacy and conciliarity

### Modern Challenges

Contemporary challenges to traditional understandings include:

- Historical questions about gaps in succession in various churches
- Feminist critiques regarding the exclusively male nature of traditional succession
- Protestant emphasis on the primacy of scripture over tradition
- The question of whether succession belongs to the esse (essence) or bene esse (well-being) of the church
- Balancing institutional continuity with legitimate reform and renewal
