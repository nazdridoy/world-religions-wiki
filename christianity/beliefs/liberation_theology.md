![Liberation theology emerged from Latin America](liberation_theology.jpg)

Liberation theology is a theological movement that emerged in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s, emphasizing Christianity's concern for the liberation of people from social, political, and economic oppression. It interprets Christian faith from the perspective of the poor and marginalized, arguing that the gospel demands a preferential option for the poor and active work toward social justice.

## Historical Origins

### Latin American Context

Liberation theology developed within a specific historical context:

- **Economic Inequality**: Extreme disparities of wealth and poverty in Latin America
- **Political Oppression**: Widespread military dictatorships and authoritarian regimes
- **Ecclesiastical Renewal**: Impact of Vatican II (1962-1965) encouraging church engagement with modern world
- **Medellín Conference**: 1968 meeting of Latin American bishops applying Vatican II to regional context
- **Base Ecclesial Communities**: Small Christian groups focusing on Bible study and social action

### Key Founding Figures

Several theologians articulated the initial vision:

- **Gustavo Gutiérrez** (Peru): Published the groundbreaking "A Theology of Liberation" (1971)
- **Leonardo Boff** (Brazil): Franciscan theologian who emphasized structural sin and ecclesial reform
- **Jon Sobrino** (El Salvador): Jesuit focusing on Christology from the perspective of the poor
- **Juan Luis Segundo** (Uruguay): Developed hermeneutical methodology for liberation theology
- **Elsa Tamez** (Mexico): Pioneer in feminist liberation theology
- **Oscar Romero** (El Salvador): Archbishop martyr who embodied liberation principles

## Theological Framework

### Methodological Approach

Liberation theology employs a distinctive methodology:

1. **Praxis-Theory-Praxis**: Beginning with lived experience and returning to transformed action
2. **See-Judge-Act**: Analyzing social conditions through lens of gospel values
3. **Hermeneutical Privilege**: Reading scripture from perspective of the marginalized
4. **Social Analysis**: Utilizing social sciences to understand structural injustice
5. **Historical Consciousness**: Emphasis on God's action in concrete history

### Biblical Foundations

Liberation theologians highlight specific biblical themes:

- **Exodus Narrative**: God's liberation of enslaved Israelites from Egypt
- **Prophetic Tradition**: Denouncing injustice and calling for social righteousness
- **Jesus' Ministry**: Preference for the poor and marginalized
- **Kingdom of God**: As a historical project of justice and peace

### Theological Concepts

## Representative Examples

> "The poor are a byproduct of the system in which we live and for which we are responsible. Hence, the poverty of the poor is not a call to generous relief action, but a demand that we go and build a different social order." - Gustavo Gutiérrez

> "When I fed the poor, they called me a saint. When I asked why they were poor, they called me a communist." - Dom Hélder Câmara
