# Stewardship

![Christian stewardship of resources](stewardship.jpg)

Stewardship in Christian theology refers to the responsible management of resources—including time, talents, finances, relationships, and the natural world—based on the understanding that everything ultimately belongs to God and humans are entrusted as caretakers. This concept derives from the fundamental belief that God is Creator and sovereign owner of all things, while humans are appointed as managers who will ultimately give account for their administration of divine gifts.

## Biblical Foundations

### Creation Narrative

The stewardship concept is rooted in Genesis:

- **Human Vocation**: Adam and Eve given responsibility to "work and take care of" the garden (Genesis 2:15)
- **Dominion Mandate**: Humans commissioned to have dominion over creation (Genesis 1:26-28)
- **Image of God**: Human stewardship reflecting divine character
- **Accountability**: Requirement to use the garden according to God's directives
- **Limitations**: Boundaries placed on human authority (forbidden fruit)

### Old Testament Development

Hebrew Scripture elaborates stewardship principles:

- **Land Theology**: Israel as steward, not owner, of Promised Land
- **Sabbath Laws**: Rest for land, animals, and people (Exodus 23:10-11)
- **Jubilee Provisions**: Periodic redistribution preventing permanent ownership (Leviticus 25)
- **First Fruits**: Offering best portion to acknowledge divine ownership (Proverbs 3:9)
- **Wisdom Literature**: Prudent management of resources as virtue (Proverbs)

Key passages include:
> "The earth is the LORD's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it." (Psalm 24:1)

> "Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops." (Proverbs 3:9)

### New Testament Teachings

Jesus and the apostles expanded stewardship concepts:

- **Parables of Stewardship**: Talents (Matthew 25:14-30), Shrewd Manager (Luke 16:1-13)
- **Kingdom Investment**: Storing treasures in heaven rather than earth (Matthew 6:19-21)
- **Generosity Emphasis**: Radical sharing with those in need (Acts 4:32-35)
- **Stewards of Grace**: Managing spiritual gifts for common good (1 Peter 4:10)
- **Final Accounting**: Ultimate responsibility before God (Romans 14:12)

Christ's teaching frequently returned to stewardship themes:
> "From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked." (Luke 12:48)

## Theological Framework
