# Biblical Interpretation

![Study of biblical texts with interpretive tools](biblical_interpretation.jpg)

Biblical interpretation (also called hermeneutics) refers to the principles, methods, and approaches used to understand and apply the texts of the Bible. As a complex collection of ancient documents written across different historical contexts, cultures, languages, and literary genres, the Bible requires careful interpretive strategies to bridge the gap between the original contexts and contemporary readers. Throughout Christian history, diverse approaches to interpretation have emerged, reflecting different theological commitments, cultural contexts, and intellectual developments.

## Historical Development of Interpretation

### Early Church Approaches (100-500 CE)

The early church developed several interpretive strategies:

- **Apostolic Interpretation**: The earliest interpreters applied Jewish exegetical methods to Christian readings
- **Rule of Faith**: Scripture interpreted within the framework of baptismal creeds and apostolic teaching
- **Literal-Historical Method**: Antiochene school (Theodore of Mopsuestia, John Chrysostom) emphasized historical and grammatical meaning
- **Allegorical Method**: Alexandrian school (Origen, Clement) emphasized multiple levels of meaning beyond the literal
- **Typological Reading**: Seeing Old Testament persons and events as prefigurements of Christ and the church
- **Augustine's Principles**: Love of God and neighbor as hermeneutical key; obscure passages interpreted by clear ones

### Medieval Interpretation (500-1500)

Medieval exegetes developed sophisticated systems:

- **Fourfold Sense of Scripture**:
  - *Literal/Historical*: The plain grammatical-historical meaning
  - *Allegorical*: Doctrinal and christological significance
  - *Tropological/Moral*: Ethical implications for Christian life
  - *Anagogical*: Eschatological significance related to eternal destiny
- **Monastic Lectio Divina**: Contemplative reading for spiritual formation
- **Scholastic Method**: Systematic interpretation using dialectical reasoning
- **Catena**: Collections of patristic interpretations
- **Jewish Influence**: Ongoing dialogue with rabbinic exegesis

### Reformation Approaches (1500-1650)

Protestant Reformation brought significant shifts:

- **Sola Scriptura**: Scripture as supreme authority over church tradition
- **Literal-Grammatical Focus**: Renewed emphasis on original languages and plain sense
- **Scripture Interpreting Scripture**: Using clearer passages to explain more difficult ones
- **Christocentric Reading**: Christ as the central focus of all Scripture
- **Vernacular Translations**: Emphasis on accessibility to all believers
- **Catholic Response**: Council of Trent affirming tradition alongside Scripture

### Modern Developments (1650-Present)

Historical-critical methods emerged:

- **Textual Criticism**: Establishing the most reliable biblical text
- **Source Criticism**: Identifying potential sources behind biblical documents
- **Form Criticism**: Analyzing literary forms and their social settings
- **Redaction Criticism**: Studying how editors shaped material
- **Historical Criticism**: Placing texts in historical context
- **Canonical Criticism**: Interpreting texts within final canonical form
- **Narrative Criticism**: Analyzing narrative features and storylines
- **Rhetorical Criticism**: Examining persuasive strategies

### Contemporary Approaches

Recent decades have seen proliferation of methods:

- **Reader-Response Criticism**: Focusing on reader's role in creating meaning
- **Postmodern Approaches**: Questioning objectivity of interpretation
- **Ideological Criticisms**: Feminist, liberation, postcolonial readings
- **Sociological Approaches**: Examining social contexts of texts and readers
- **Psychological Interpretations**: Applying psychological insights
- **Intertextual Readings**: Exploring relationships between biblical texts
- **Speech-Act Theory**: Analyzing what texts do, not just what they say
- **Theological Interpretation**: Renewed focus on Scripture as God's word to the church

## Interpretive Principles

### Text and Context

Basic hermeneutical considerations include:

- **Original Languages**: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek usage and grammar
- **Historical Context**: Cultural, political, and social background
- **Literary Context**: Immediate textual setting and broader biblical context
- **Literary Genre**: Different approaches for different types of literature (narrative, poetry, prophecy, epistle, apocalyptic)
- **Author's Intent**: Seeking the communicative intention of human authors
- **Canonical Position**: Text's function within the whole biblical canon

### Theological Frameworks

Various theological approaches to interpretation include:

- **Covenantal Reading**: Scripture understood through progressive covenant framework
- **Dispensational Approach**: Distinguishing different divine administrations
- **Redemptive-Historical**: Reading Scripture as unified redemption narrative
- **Kingdom Framework**: Interpreting through lens of God's kingdom
- **Trinitarian Hermeneutic**: Reading Scripture with trinitarian theological framework
- **Christocentric Focus**: Christ as interpretive center of all Scripture
- **Salvation-Historical**: Focus on unfolding history of salvation

### Hermeneutical Issues

Ongoing interpretive challenges include:

- **Scripture and Tradition**: Relationship between biblical text and interpretive tradition
- **Letter vs. Spirit**: Balancing literal meaning and deeper significance
- **Cultural Distance**: Bridging ancient contexts and contemporary application
- **Unity and Diversity**: Holding together Scripture's diverse voices and unified message
- **Divine and Human**: Scripture as both divine revelation and human text
- **Authority and Interpretation**: Relationship between text's authority and interpretive community
- **Theory and Practice**: Moving from interpretation to application
