![Church concept in Christian theology](ecclesiology.jpg)

Ecclesiology—from the Greek *ekklesia* meaning "assembly" or "called-out ones"—is the theological study of the Christian church, its origins, nature, purpose, organization, and practices. This doctrine addresses fundamental questions about what the church is, how it should function, and its role in God's redemptive plan.

## Biblical Foundations

### Old Testament Foreshadowing

Several Old Testament concepts anticipate the church:

- **People of God**: Israel as a chosen community (Deuteronomy 7:6-8)
- **Covenant Community**: People bound to God through covenant relationship (Exodus 19:5-6)
- **Assembly (qahal)**: Gathered congregation of God's people (Psalm 22:22)
- **Remnant**: Faithful portion preserved by God (Isaiah 10:20-22)
- **Prophetic anticipation**: Visions of universal worship (Isaiah 2:2-4, Micah 4:1-3)

### New Testament Development

The New Testament presents several foundational images of the church:

- **Body of Christ**: Organic unity with diversity of function (1 Corinthians 12:12-27, Ephesians 1:22-23)
- **Bride of Christ**: Intimate relationship and future union (Ephesians 5:25-32, Revelation 19:7-9)
- **Temple of the Holy Spirit**: God's dwelling place (1 Corinthians 3:16-17, Ephesians 2:19-22)
- **Royal Priesthood**: Mediating God's presence to the world (1 Peter 2:9-10)
- **Household of God**: Family relationship with God as Father (Ephesians 2:19, 1 Timothy 3:15)
- **Flock**: Under Christ's shepherding care (John 10:1-18, 1 Peter 5:2-4)
- **Vine and Branches**: Dependent on Christ for life (John 15:1-8)

### Key Terms and Concepts

Biblical ecclesiology involves several interrelated concepts:

- **Ekklesia**: The "called-out assembly" or gathering of believers
- **Koinonia**: Fellowship or communion shared among members
