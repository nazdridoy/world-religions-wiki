# Real Presence

![Eucharistic celebration](real_presence.jpg)

The doctrine of the Real Presence affirms that Jesus Christ is truly, really, and substantially present in the Eucharist (also called Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper). This theological concept addresses how Christ is present in the consecrated bread and wine, constituting one of Christianity's most significant and nuanced theological discussions. While Christian traditions differ considerably in their explanations of the mode and nature of this presence, the belief that Christ is somehow specially present in the Eucharist has been maintained by the majority of Christian traditions throughout history.

## Biblical Foundations

### New Testament Accounts

Several key biblical passages form the foundation for belief in the Real Presence:

- **Institution Narratives**: Found in Matthew 26:26-28, Mark 14:22-24, Luke 22:19-20, and 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, these describe Jesus at the Last Supper saying, "This is my body" and "This is my blood"

- **John 6:51-58**: Jesus's discourse on the Bread of Life includes statements such as, "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life... For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them"

- **1 Corinthians 10:16**: "The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation (koinonia) in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?"

- **1 Corinthians 11:27-29**: Paul warns that "whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord," suggesting something beyond mere symbolism

### Early Church Practice

The earliest Christian communities emphasized the Eucharist's importance:

- The Didache (c. 50-120 CE) includes eucharistic prayers and instructions
- Justin Martyr (c. 100-165 CE) described the early Christian understanding that the eucharistic elements were not ordinary food and drink
- Regular "breaking of bread" was central to early Christian worship (Acts 2:42)

## Historical Development

### Patristic Period

Early Church Fathers widely affirmed Christ's real presence, though with varying emphases:

- **Ignatius of Antioch** (c. 110 CE): "The Eucharist is the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ"
- **Irenaeus of Lyon** (c. 180 CE): Connected the Eucharist to the incarnation and resurrection
- **Cyril of Jerusalem** (c. 350 CE): Taught that the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ
- **John Chrysostom** (c. 390 CE): Emphasized that Christ transforms the elements through the priest
- **Augustine of Hippo** (c. 400 CE): Used more symbolic language but affirmed a real spiritual presence

### Medieval Developments

The Middle Ages saw more precise articulations:

- **Paschasius Radbertus** (9th century): Emphasized the literal identification of the elements with Christ's body and blood
- **Ratramnus** (9th century): Stressed a more spiritual interpretation
- **Berengar of Tours** (11th century): Questioned physical presence, leading to controversy
- **Fourth Lateran Council** (1215): First used the term "transubstantiation" officially
- **Thomas Aquinas** (13th century): Developed the philosophical explanation of transubstantiation using Aristotelian categories

### Reformation Disputes

The Reformation produced substantial debates about the Eucharist:

- **Martin Luther**: Rejected transubstantiation but maintained Christ's bodily presence "in, with, and under" the elements (sometimes called "consubstantiation")
- **Huldrych Zwingli**: Advocated a memorial view where the elements merely symbolize Christ's body and blood
- **John Calvin**: Proposed a middle position of "spiritual real presence" where Christ is spiritually but truly present through the power of the Holy Spirit
- **Thomas Cranmer**: Initially held a Lutheran view but moved toward a more Reformed position
- **Council of Trent** (1545-1563): Reaffirmed and defined transubstantiation in response to Protestant challenges

## Theological Understandings

### Catholic View: Transubstantiation

The Roman Catholic Church teaches:

- At consecration, the substance of bread and wine changes into the substance of Christ's body and blood
- Only the "accidents" (outward appearances) of bread and wine remain
- Christ's presence continues as long as the species (appearances) of bread and wine remain
- Christ is entirely present in each element and in each part of the elements (totus Christus)
- The change is ontological and objective, not dependent on the faith of recipients

### Orthodox View: Metabole

Eastern Orthodoxy teaches:

- The bread and wine become the actual body and blood of Christ
- The change is a divine mystery (mysterion) that cannot be fully explained
- Less focused on philosophical explanations than Catholic theology
- Emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit (epiclesis) in the transformation
- Some theologians use "transubstantiation," while others prefer "metabole" (change)

### Lutheran View: Sacramental Union

Lutheranism teaches:

- Christ is physically present "in, with, and under" the bread and wine
- The substances of bread and wine remain alongside Christ's body and blood
- The term "consubstantiation" is sometimes applied but was not used by Luther
- The ubiquity (omnipresence) of Christ's glorified body makes this possible
- The presence is tied to the moment of reception, not extended beyond

### Reformed/Calvinist View: Spiritual Real Presence

Reformed theology teaches:

- Christ is truly present spiritually but not physically in the elements
- The Holy Spirit lifts communicants to heaven where Christ is present
- Believers feed on Christ through faith
- There is a mystical union with Christ in the sacrament
- The presence is real but not corporeal or local

### Anglican View: Various Interpretations

Anglicanism encompasses multiple views:

- The 39 Articles rejected transubstantiation but affirmed a real "partaking" of Christ
- Anglo-Catholics often embrace positions close to transubstantiation
- Evangelical Anglicans typically hold views closer to Calvin's spiritual presence
- The "via media" (middle way) allows for diverse interpretations
- The focus is on the mystery and effect rather than precise explanation

### Memorial/Symbolic Views

Some Protestant denominations teach:

- The elements are symbols that represent Christ's sacrifice
- Communion is primarily an act of remembrance and gratitude
- The spiritual benefit comes through faith and memory, not the elements themselves
- Christ is present in the gathered community, not specifically in the elements
- Emphasis on obedience to Christ's command to remember

## Theological Significance

### Christological Implications

The Real Presence connects to Christology:

- Relates to how Christ's humanity and divinity interact after the resurrection
- Connects to the ongoing work of the incarnate Christ
- Raises questions about the nature of Christ's glorified body
- Demonstrates Christ's continuing solidarity with humanity
- Extends the incarnational principle that God meets us in physical reality

### Ecclesiological Dimensions

The doctrine shapes understanding of the church:

- Establishes the Eucharist as constitutive of the church's identity
- Impacts the understanding of ordained ministry
- Affects how church unity and division are understood
- Influences the architecture and arrangement of worship spaces
- Shapes the rhythm of church life around eucharistic celebration

### Soteriological Aspects

Real Presence relates to salvation:

- Provides a means of grace for ongoing sanctification
- Connects believers to Christ's saving work on the cross
- Offers foretaste of eschatological communion with God
- Emphasizes embodied rather than purely spiritual salvation
- Unites believers with Christ and one another

## Liturgical Expressions

### Catholic Practice

Catholic liturgical practices reflect belief in transubstantiation:

- Genuflection before the tabernacle where consecrated hosts are reserved
- Eucharistic adoration and Benediction services
- Corpus Christi processions
- Careful handling of consecrated elements
- Communion typically received on the tongue historically, now often in the hand

### Orthodox Practice

Orthodox liturgical practices emphasize mystery:

- The Divine Liturgy with elaborate preparation of the gifts
- Communion given by intinction (bread dipped in wine) using a spoon
- Iconostasis separating sanctuary, highlighting sacred mystery
- Careful consumption of all consecrated elements
- Prostrations and profound reverence

### Protestant Variations

Protestant practices vary widely:

- **Lutheran**: Elements treated with reverence; sometimes kneeling for reception
- **Anglican**: Diverse practices from elaborate to simple
- **Reformed**: Typically sitting for communion, emphasis on communal aspect
- **Baptist/Free Church**: Simple tables, often infrequent celebration
- **Methodist**: Open table communion emphasizing prevenient grace

## Contemporary Issues

### Ecumenical Dialogue

Modern ecumenical discussions have addressed the Real Presence:

- The Lima Document (1982) acknowledged "significant convergence" while recognizing different expressions
- Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission has found substantial agreement on eucharistic presence
- Lutheran-Catholic dialogues have identified significant common ground
- Receptive ecumenism encourages learning from other traditions' eucharistic spirituality
- Joint eucharistic celebrations remain a point of tension and aspiration

### Scientific Worldview

Contemporary theology engages modern scientific understanding:

- Reframing metaphysical language in post-Enlightenment context
- Addressing how modern physics affects understanding of substance and reality
- Engaging with materialist objections to metaphysical changes
- Exploring neuroscience of ritual and symbolism
- Reconsidering the relationship between matter and meaning

### Pastoral Considerations

Practical implications include:

- Communicating the doctrine in contemporary language
- Addressing who may receive communion (open vs. closed communion)
- Practices regarding gluten-free hosts and non-alcoholic wine
- Online/virtual communion debates during the COVID-19
- Balancing reverence with accessibility
