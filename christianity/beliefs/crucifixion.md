The crucifixion of Jesus Christ represents the central event in Christian salvation history and the most profound expression of God's love for humanity. As the ultimate sacrifice that reconciles sinful humanity with a holy God, the cross stands as Christianity's most recognizable symbol and the foundation of its theological system.

## Biblical Accounts
