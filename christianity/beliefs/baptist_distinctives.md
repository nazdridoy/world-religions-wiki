# Baptist Distinctives

![Baptist Distinctives](baptist_distinctives.jpg)

Baptist distinctives are the theological convictions and ecclesiological practices that have historically characterized Baptist churches and distinguished them from other Christian denominations. While there is diversity within the Baptist tradition, these distinctives have formed the foundation for Baptist identity and continue to inform Baptist expressions worldwide. Often summarized through acronyms like "BAPTISTS" or "BAPTIST," these principles reflect Baptist understandings of church, faith, and Christian life.

## Core Distinctives

### Biblical Authority

Baptists emphasize:
- **Scripture as the supreme authority** for faith and practice
- The Bible as sufficient, clear, and self-interpreting
- Individual responsibility to study and interpret Scripture
- Scripture over tradition, creeds, and church hierarchies
- The New Testament as the primary guide for church order

Baptist theologian E.Y. Mullins wrote:
> "The Bible, and the Bible alone, is our rule of faith and practice."

### Autonomy of the Local Church

Baptist churches maintain:
- **Each congregation as self-governing** under Christ's lordship
- Freedom from external ecclesiastical control
- Authority to call/dismiss pastors and leaders
- Right to determine membership and discipline
- Independence in setting mission priorities and budgets
- Voluntary cooperation with other churches

### Priesthood of All Believers

This distinctive affirms:
- **Direct access to God** for all Christians without human mediators
- Every believer's responsibility to minister
- Spiritual gifts distributed among all members
- Shared responsibility for church governance
- Universal calling to evangelism and service
- Competency of every soul in matters of faith

### Two Ordinances

Baptists typically recognize only:
- **Baptism by immersion** of believers

### Two Offices
