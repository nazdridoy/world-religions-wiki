# Sanctification

![Christian growth](sanctification.jpg)

Sanctification is the ongoing process by which believers in Christ are transformed to become more like Jesus in character, thought, and action. This theological concept addresses how Christians grow in holiness after salvation, reflecting God's intention to restore His image in humanity through the work of the Holy Spirit.

## Biblical Foundation

### Key Passages

The New Testament contains numerous references to sanctification:

- **1 Thessalonians 4:3-7**: "For this is the will of God, your sanctification..."
- **Romans 6:22**: "But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life."
- **2 Corinthians 3:18**: "And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another."
- **Philippians 2:12-13**: "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."
- **Hebrews 12:14**: "Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord."
- **1 Peter 1:15-16**: "But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'"

### Old Testament Background

The concept is rooted in the Old Testament idea of holiness:
- The Hebrew term *qadosh* (holy) means "set apart" or "consecrated"
- Israel was called to be a holy nation (Exodus 19:6)
- Levitical laws emphasized ritual and moral purity
- The prophets emphasized inner transformation (Ezekiel 36:26-27)

## Theological Understanding

### Definition

Sanctification can be defined as:
1. The act of making holy or setting apart for sacred use
2. The process of becoming more Christlike in character and conduct
3. The progressive restoration of the image of God in the believer

In theological terms, it is often described as "the work of God's free grace, whereby we are renewed in the whole person after the image of God, and are enabled more and more to die unto sin, and live unto righteousness" (Westminster Shorter Catechism).

### Relationship to Other Doctrines

Sanctification connects to several key theological concepts:

- **Justification**: Legal declaration of righteousness (distinct but related)
- **Regeneration**: The new birth that initiates sanctification
- **Glorification**: The completion of sanctification in the resurrection
- **Pneumatology**: The Holy Spirit's essential role in sanctification
- **Christology**: Christ as both model and means of sanctification
- **Anthropology**: Human nature and the renewal of God's image
- **Ecclesiology**: The church as context for sanctification

## Major Theological Perspectives

### Roman Catholic View

- Sanctification begins with baptism
- Involves infusion of grace through sacraments
- Distinguished between mortal and venial sins
- Includes both justification and inner transformation
- May continue after death through purgatory

### Eastern Orthodox View

- Emphasizes *theosis* (deification) â€“ participation in divine nature
- Focuses on mystical union with God
- Achieved through prayer, liturgy, ascetic disciplines
- Stresses continuing work of the Holy Spirit
- Sees transformation as progressive assimilation to divine life

### Lutheran View

- Emphasizes forensic justification distinct from sanctification
- Views sanctification as gratitude-motivated response to justification
- Maintains tension between *simul justus et peccator* (simultaneously justified and sinner)
- Emphasizes means of grace (Word and Sacrament)
- Warns against legalism and works-righteousness

### Reformed/Calvinist View

- Emphasizes God's sovereignty in sanctification
- Views sanctification as inevitable consequence of genuine faith
- Stresses "definitive sanctification" (decisive break with sin's power) and progressive sanctification
- Focuses on covenant faithfulness and law as guide
- Teaches the "third use of the law" as guide for Christian living

### Wesleyan/Methodist View

- Emphasizes possibility of "entire sanctification" or "Christian perfection"
- Distinguishes between outward sin and inward corruption
- Teaches possibility of complete devotion to God in this life
- Stresses both crisis experiences and gradual growth
- Balances divine and human agency in spiritual growth

### Pentecostal/Charismatic View

- Often emphasizes distinct "second blessing" or baptism in the Spirit
- Focuses on supernatural empowerment for holiness
- Stresses evidence of sanctification in spiritual gifts
- Emphasizes experiential dimension of holiness
- Places high value on testimony and demonstration

## Historical Development

### Patristic Period

Early church fathers like Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen developed initial concepts of Christian growth and perfection, often influenced by Greek philosophical categories.

### Medieval Period

Medieval theology, exemplified by Thomas Aquinas, developed systematic understandings of sanctification involving infused grace, virtues, and spiritual disciplines. Mystical traditions emphasized direct experience of God.

### Reformation

Reformers reacted against works-righteousness while developing their own understandings:

- Calvin systematized understanding of progressive sanctification
- Radical reformers often emphasized visible holiness and church discipline

### Post-Reformation

Later theological developments included:
- Puritan emphasis on practical holiness and detailed spiritual direction
- Pietist focus on personal devotion and spiritual experience
- Wesley's doctrine of Christian perfection
- Keswick and Higher Life movements' emphasis on victorious Christian living
- Twentieth-century emphasis on Spirit-filled living
