Christian ethics is the systematic study of moral principles, values, and conduct grounded in Christian theology and scripture. It addresses how Christians should live in relation to God, themselves, others, and creation. With its rich and diverse tradition spanning two millennia, Christian ethics has developed multiple frameworks for moral reasoning while maintaining core commitments to love, justice, and human dignity derived from the Christian understanding of God's character and work in Christ.

## Biblical Foundations

### Old Testament Sources

Hebrew scripture establishes foundational ethical principles:

- **Torah**: Comprehensive framework of moral and ritual law
- **Decalogue (Ten Commandments)**: Core ethical requirements (Exodus 20:1-17)
- **Prophetic Tradition**: Social justice emphasis and critique of oppression
- **Wisdom Literature**: Practical guidance for virtuous living
- **Covenantal Framework**: Ethics grounded in relationship with God

### New Testament Development

Jesus and the apostles transformed ethical understanding:

- **Jesus' Teaching**: Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7), parables, Great Commandment
- **Kingdom Ethics**: Moral vision of God's reign breaking into present
- **Pauline Ethics**: Freedom in Christ and guidance of the Spirit
- **Love Command**: "Love one another as I have loved you" (John 13:34)
- **Eschatological Motivation**: Ethical living in light of Christ's return

> "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind... Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." (Matthew 22:37-40)
