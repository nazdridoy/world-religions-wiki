# Theology Proper: The Doctrine of God

![God concept in Christian theology](theology_proper.jpg)

Theology Proper is the branch of Christian theology that focuses specifically on the nature, attributes, and works of God. This foundational doctrine addresses who God is in essence and character, how God relates to creation, and how humans can know God. While Christian theology encompasses many topics, theology proper centers on understanding God as distinct from creation and in relation to humanity.

## Biblical Foundations

### Old Testament Revelation

The Hebrew Scriptures reveal God through:

- **Divine names**: YHWH (the personal covenant name), Elohim (powerful creator), El Shaddai (God Almighty), Adonai (Lord)
- **Monotheistic affirmation**: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4)
- **Creator and Sovereign**: God as maker and ruler of all (Genesis 1-2, Psalm 104)
- **Covenant relationship**: God who initiates relationship with humanity (Genesis 12, Exodus 19-24)
- **Divine attributes**: Justice, mercy, faithfulness, holiness (Exodus 34:6-7)
- **Divine actions**: Creation, redemption, judgment, blessing
- **Anthropomorphic language**: Human-like descriptions while maintaining transcendence

### New Testament Development

The New Testament expands understanding of God through:

- **Trinitarian implications**: Father, Son, and Spirit as one God (Matthew 28:19, 2 Corinthians 13:14)
- **God as Father**: Jesus' distinctive address as "Abba" (Mark 14:36)
- **Divine self-revelation in Christ**: "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father" (John 14:9)
- **Divine love**: God's nature expressed in redemptive action (John 3:16, 1 John 4:8)
- **Divine purpose**: Cosmic reconciliation in Christ (Ephesians 1:9-10, Colossians 1:19-20)
- **Divine presence**: God dwelling with humanity through Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16)
- **Divine consummation**: God as "all in all" (1 Corinthians 15:28)

### Theological Themes

Biblical revelation establishes several core themes about God:

- **Transcendence**: God as beyond and above creation
- **Immanence**: God as present and active within creation
- **Personal nature**: God as relational, communicative, and purposeful
- **Moral character**: God as holy, righteous, and loving
- **Sovereignty**: God's supreme authority and providential governance
- **Trinity**: One divine essence in three persons
- **Self-revelation**: God's initiative to be known by creatures

## Historical Development
