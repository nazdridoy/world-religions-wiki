![Pentecostal worship gathering](pentecostal_distinctives.jpg)

Pentecostalism is a major Christian movement that emerged in the early 20th century, characterized by an emphasis on direct personal experience of God through the baptism in the Holy Spirit. While Pentecostals share many core beliefs with other evangelical Christians, they are distinguished by several distinctive theological emphases and practices that have shaped their identity and contributed to their remarkable global growth.

## Historical Origins

### Early Pentecostal Revival

Pentecostalism emerged from several roots:

- **Holiness Movement**: 19th-century emphasis on sanctification as a distinct experience
- **Keswick "Higher Life" Movement**: Teaching on Spirit empowerment for service
- **Healing Revivals**: Late 19th-century emphasis on divine healing
- **African American Spirituality**: Expressive worship traditions and oral theology
- **Global Revival Movements**: Phenomena in Wales, India, and Korea that reported similar experiences

The movement crystallized through two key events:
1. **Topeka Outpouring (1901)**: Students at Charles Parham's Bible school in Kansas spoke in tongues on January 1
2. **Azusa Street Revival (1906-1909)**: William J. Seymour led a revival in Los Angeles that attracted global attention

### Institutional Development

Within decades, the movement developed institutional forms:
- **Assemblies of God** (1914): Largest Pentecostal denomination globally
- **Church of God in Christ**: Largest predominantly African American Pentecostal body
- **International Church of the Foursquare Gospel** (1923): Founded by Aimee Semple McPherson
- **Pentecostal World Fellowship** (1947): International fellowship of Pentecostal churches
- **United Pentecostal Church International**: Oneness Pentecostal organization

## Core Theological Distinctives

### Baptism in the Holy Spirit

Central to Pentecostal identity is the doctrine that:
- The baptism in the Holy Spirit is distinct from and subsequent to conversion
- It is evidenced initially by speaking in tongues (glossolalia)
- It empowers believers for witness and service
- It is available to all believers who seek it
- It is biblically modeled in Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19

> "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance." â€” Acts 2:4

### Full Gospel

Pentecostals often describe their message as the "full gospel" or "foursquare gospel," emphasizing:
1. **Jesus as Savior**: Salvation through faith in Christ's atonement
2. **Jesus as Sanctifier**: Holiness through the Spirit's transforming work
3. **Jesus as Healer**: Divine healing as provided in the atonement
4. **Jesus as Baptizer in the Spirit**: Empowerment for Christian witness
5. **Jesus as Soon-Coming King**: Expectation of Christ's imminent return

### Restorationism

Many Pentecostals understand their movement as:
- A restoration of New Testament Christianity
- A recovery of apostolic power and gifts
- A fulfillment of prophetic expectations about the end times
- A revival of primitive church experiences
- Evidence of the "latter rain" before Christ's return

### Spiritual Gifts

Pentecostal theology emphasizes:
- The ongoing validity of all spiritual gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12
- The normative nature of supernatural manifestations in church life
- The democratization of spiritual gifts across all believers
- The importance of prophecy, healing, and discernment
- Tongues as both evidence of Spirit baptism and ongoing gift

### Divine Healing

Distinctive aspects of the Pentecostal doctrine of healing include:
- Physical healing as provided in Christ's atonement
- Expectation of supernatural intervention in response to prayer
- The practice of laying on of hands and anointing with oil
- Testimony as validation of healing experiences
- Balancing of divine healing with medical treatment (in most traditions)

## Worship and Practice

- Corporate and individual praying in tongues

### Leadership and Authority

Pentecostal churches typically feature:
- Emphasis on spiritual gifts as qualification for leadership
