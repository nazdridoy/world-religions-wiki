![Reformed theological tradition](reformed_theology.jpg)

Reformed theology represents one of the major theological traditions emerging from the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. Rooted in the work of reformers such as John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and Heinrich Bullinger, Reformed theology emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of Scripture, and a systematic understanding of Christian doctrine. It is characterized by its covenantal framework, emphasis on divine election, and commitment to the reformation of church and society according to biblical principles.

## Historical Development

### Reformation Origins

Reformed theology emerged as a distinct tradition through several key reformers:

## Foundational Principles

### Theological Method

Reformed approach to theology has distinctive characteristics:

- **Sola Scriptura**: Scripture as supreme authority for faith and practice
- **Tota Scriptura**: Whole counsel of God in all of Scripture
- **Analogia Fidei**: Scripture interprets Scripture according to "analogy of faith"
- **Systematic coherence**: Logical consistency throughout theological system
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic**: Scripture read as unified redemptive narrative
- **General and special revelation**: God revealed in creation and Scripture

### Five Solas

Reformed theology is often summarized by five key principles:

1. **Sola Scriptura**: Scripture alone as ultimate authority
2. **Sola Fide**: Justification by faith alone
3. **Sola Gratia**: Salvation by grace alone
4. **Solus Christus**: Christ alone as mediator
5. **Soli Deo Gloria**: Glory to God alone as ultimate purpose

### TULIP (Five Points of Calvinism)

A mnemonic summarizing Reformed soteriology from the Synod of Dort:

- **Total Depravity**: Human inability to contribute to salvation
- **Unconditional Election**: God's sovereign choice not based on foreseen faith
- **Limited Atonement**: Christ's death effectively securing salvation for the elect
- **Irresistible Grace**: Effectual calling that overcomes resistance
- **Perseverance of the Saints**: Preservation of believers to final salvation
