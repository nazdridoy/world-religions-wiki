# Vocation

![Christian understanding of calling](vocation.jpg)

Vocation, from the Latin *vocare* ("to call"), refers to the Christian understanding of calling—the concept that God summons believers to particular purposes, roles, and ways of life. Far more than merely career choice, vocation encompasses a comprehensive theological framework for understanding how God works through human lives and how believers should discern and fulfill divine purposes in every sphere of existence.

## Biblical Foundations

### Old Testament Patterns

The Hebrew Scriptures contain numerous examples of divine calling:

- **Patriarchal Calls**: Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3), Moses (Exodus 3:1-10), Samuel (1 Samuel 3)
- **Prophetic Commissions**: Isaiah (Isaiah 6), Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:4-10), Ezekiel (Ezekiel 2-3)
- **Royal Appointments**: David (1 Samuel 16), Solomon (1 Kings 3)
- **Wisdom Literature**: Emphasis on living skillfully in one's station (Proverbs)
- **Creation Mandate**: Human vocation to steward creation (Genesis 1:28, 2:15)

These calls typically involve:
1. Divine initiative
2. Human resistance or inadequacy
3. Divine reassurance
4. Transformation of identity
5. Specific mission or purpose

### New Testament Developments

The New Testament develops vocational themes:

- **Jesus' Call**: Disciples leaving occupations to follow (Matthew 4:18-22, Mark 1:16-20)
- **Pauline Language**: "Called to be saints" (Romans 1:7), "calling to which you were called" (Ephesians 4:1)
- **Spiritual Gifts**: Different functions within one body (1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12)
- **Universal Priesthood**: All believers having spiritual calling (1 Peter 2:9)
- **Workplace Ethics**: Instructions to slaves and masters reflecting vocational faithfulness (Colossians 3:22-4:1)

## Historical Development

### Early Church Period

Early Christians understood vocation primarily in spiritual terms:

- **Martyrdom**: Ultimate form of witness as vocation
- **Monastic Calling**: Beginning with desert fathers and mothers
- **Clergy/Laity Distinction**: Emergence of "religious" vocations as distinct
- **Baptismal Call**: All Christians called to discipleship through baptism
- **Augustine**: Articulation of calling to love God above all

### Medieval Conceptions

Medieval Christianity developed a clearer hierarchy of vocations:

- **Religious Life**: Monks, nuns, and priests having "higher" calling
- **Sacred/Secular Divide**: Distinct spheres of worldly and spiritual activity
- **Three Estates**: Those who pray (clergy), fight (nobility), and work (peasantry)
- **Benedict's Rule**: Monastic vocation as "work of God" (opus Dei) through prayer and labor
- **Thomas Aquinas**: Integration of Aristotelian concepts of purpose with Christian calling

### Reformation Transformation

Protestant reformers radically reimagined vocation:

- **Luther's Revolution**: Concept that all legitimate work—not just religious life—constitutes divine calling
- **Priesthood of Believers**: Demolishing special spiritual status of clergy
- **Sanctification of Ordinary**: Finding God's purpose in everyday roles and responsibilities
- **Calvin's Approach**: Stewardship of all life activities for God's glory
- **Puritan Development**: Detailed attention to discerning and fulfilling particular callings

Luther wrote:
> "The works of monks and priests, however holy and arduous they may be, do not differ one whit in the sight of God from the works of the rustic laborer in the field or the woman going about her household tasks... all works are measured before God by faith alone."

### Modern Developments

More recent theological contributions include:

- **Industrial Revolution**: Challenges to vocational thinking amid changing nature of work
- **Catholic Social Teaching**: Renewed emphasis on dignity of work and workers' rights
- **Secular Professionalism**: Tension between religious calling and specialized expertise
- **Feminist Critique**: Questioning gender-based assumptions about vocation
- **Global Perspectives**: Diverse cultural understandings of work, calling, and purpose

## Theological Dimensions

### Divine and Human Agency

Vocational theology addresses the interplay of God's will and human choice:

- **Predetermined vs. Open**: Extent to which vocations are preordained
