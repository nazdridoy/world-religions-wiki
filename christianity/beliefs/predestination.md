# Predestination

![Predestination](predestination.jpg)

Predestination is a theological doctrine concerning God's foreordination of the ultimate destiny of individuals, particularly regarding salvation. It addresses the question of how divine sovereignty, human freedom, and eternal destiny intersect in God's plan.

## Biblical Foundation

Several key biblical passages inform the doctrine of predestination:

- "For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son... And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified" (Romans 8:29-30)
- "For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will" (Ephesians 1:4-5)
- "In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will" (Ephesians 1:11)
- "What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction? What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory?" (Romans 9:22-23)

## Historical Development

### Early Church
The early church fathers did not systematically address predestination, though Augustine developed a strong view in response to Pelagian teachings about human ability. Augustine taught that due to original sin, humans cannot choose God without divine grace, making salvation entirely dependent on God's predestining choice.

### Medieval Period
Thomas Aquinas synthesized Augustinian predestination with Aristotelian metaphysics, teaching that God predestines the saved while permitting but not actively causing the damnation of others (single predestination).

### Reformation
Martin Luther emphasized predestination while focusing primarily on justification by faith. John Calvin developed a more systematic approach, teaching "double predestination"—God actively chooses some for salvation (election) and others for damnation (reprobation).

### Post-Reformation
Jacob Arminius challenged strict Calvinist views, arguing that predestination is based on God's foreknowledge of who would freely choose faith in Christ. The Synod of Dort (1618-1619) rejected Arminian views, affirming unconditional election.

## Major Interpretations

### 1. Double Predestination (Supralapsarianism)
God actively decrees both election and reprobation before considering the Fall. This view emphasizes God's absolute sovereignty over all human destinies.

### 2. Single Predestination (Infralapsarianism)
God actively elects some to salvation but merely passes over others, allowing them to face the consequences of their sin. This view attempts to distance God from actively causing damnation.

### 3. Conditional Election (Arminianism)
God predestines based on foreseen faith. Election is conditional upon human response to God's grace, which can be freely accepted or rejected.

### 4. Corporate Election
Predestination primarily concerns groups rather than individuals. God predestines the church as a body, and individuals participate in this election through faith.

### 5. Barthian View
Karl Barth reinterpreted predestination as primarily about Jesus Christ—the elected one (for salvation) and rejected one (in crucifixion). Humans participate in Christ's election through faith.

## Denominational Perspectives

### Reformed/Presbyterian
Reformed traditions typically teach unconditional election—God's choice of individuals for salvation based solely on His sovereign will, not on foreseen merit or faith.

### Lutheran
Lutherans affirm single predestination (election to salvation) while avoiding teaching reprobation. They emphasize the universal offer of salvation through grace.

### Roman Catholic
Catholic teaching affirms predestination while emphasizing God's desire for universal salvation and human cooperation with grace. The Council of Trent rejected the idea that God predestines anyone to damnation.

### Methodist/Wesleyan
Following Arminius, Wesleyans teach conditional election based on God's foreknowledge of faith, emphasizing human free response to God's prevenient grace.

### Eastern Orthodox
Orthodox theology largely avoids systematic treatment of predestination, emphasizing the mystery of God's ways and focusing on the synergy between divine grace and human freedom.

## Theological Tensions

Predestination involves several theological tensions:

1. **Divine Sovereignty vs. Human Freedom**: How can God predetermine salvation while humans make genuine choices?
2. **Justice vs. Mercy**: Is it just for God to choose some and not others?
3. **Universal Love vs. Particular Election**: How does predestination reconcile with God's love for all people?
4. **Security vs. Perseverance**: Does predestination guarantee eternal security or require human perseverance?
5. **Evangelism**: Why evangelize if salvation is predetermined?

## Pastoral Considerations

Theologians across traditions note several pastoral considerations regarding predestination:

- The doctrine should instill humble gratitude rather than pride or presumption
- It should provide assurance of salvation rather than anxiety about election
- Speculation about others' election status should be avoided
- The doctrine should motivate, not diminish, evangelistic efforts
- God's revealed will (desire for all to be saved) should guide practice, even if His secret decrees remain mysterious
