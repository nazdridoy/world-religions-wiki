Eastern Orthodox theology represents one of Christianity's oldest and most distinctive theological traditions. Rooted in the Greek-speaking Christian East, Orthodox theology emphasizes the mystery of God, the deification of humanity, and the apostolic tradition preserved through liturgical life and conciliar teaching. Orthodox theology is characterized by its apophatic approach, its emphasis on theosis (deification), and its commitment to maintaining the authentic faith of the early church.

## Historical Development

### Patristic Foundations

Eastern Orthodoxy considers the Church Fathers central to its theological identity:

- **Athanasius of Alexandria** (c.296-373): Defense of Christ's divinity and soteriology
- **Cappadocian Fathers**:
  - **Basil the Great** (330-379): Trinitarian theology and monastic rule
  - **Gregory of Nazianzus** (329-390): Christological and pneumatological precision
  - **Gregory of Nyssa** (c.335-395): Mystical theology and universal salvation possibility
