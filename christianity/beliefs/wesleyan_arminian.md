# Wesleyan-Arminian Theology

![Wesleyan-Arminian theological tradition](wesleyan_arminian.jpg)

Wesleyan-Arminian theology represents a significant Protestant theological tradition emphasizing God's universal grace, human free will, and the possibility of holiness in the Christian life. Emerging from the theological work of Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609) and later developed more fully by English reformer John Wesley (1703-1791), this theological framework offers a distinct alternative to Reformed Calvinism while maintaining Protestant emphases on Scripture, grace, and faith. It is characterized by its optimistic view of grace, emphasis on human response in salvation, and distinctive doctrine of Christian perfection.

## Historical Development

### Arminian Origins

The theological framework began with Jacobus Arminius, a Dutch theologian:

- **Jacobus Arminius** (1560-1609): Reformed pastor and professor who questioned aspects of strict Calvinism
- **Remonstrance** (1610): Five points articulated by Arminius' followers after his death
- **Synod of Dort** (1618-1619): Condemned Arminianism and formulated the Five Points of Calvinism in response
- **Persecution and spread**: Despite official condemnation, Arminian ideas continued to influence Dutch and English theology
- **Hugo Grotius** (1583-1645): Developed governmental theory of atonement in Arminian framework
- **Simon Episcopius** (1583-1643): Systematized Arminian thought

### Wesleyan Development

John Wesley and early Methodism significantly expanded and developed Arminian ideas:

- **John Wesley's conversion** (1738): Aldersgate experience provided spiritual foundation

- **Wesley's writings**:
  - *Predestination Calmly Considered* (1752)

  - *Plain Account of Christian Perfection* (1766)
  - Sermons such as "Free Grace," "On Working Out Our Own Salvation," and "Christian Perfection"
- **Charles Wesley** (1707-1788): Hymnody that popularized Arminian theology
- **John Fletcher** (1729-1785): Wesley's designated successor who systematized his theology

- **Pentecostal development**: Later connected to baptism in the Holy Spirit

### Conditional Security

Wesleyan-Arminian understanding of perseverance:

- **Possibility of apostasy**: Believers can fall from grace
