# Attributes of God

![Divine attributes in Christian art](attributes.jpg)

The attributes of God in Christian theology refer to the characteristics, qualities, and perfections that describe God's nature and being. These attributes, derived from Scripture and theological reflection, help Christians understand and relate to God while recognizing the ultimate mystery and transcendence of the divine nature. While different traditions may categorize and emphasize different aspects of God's character, the attributes collectively express the Christian understanding of who God is and how God relates to creation.

## Foundational Concepts

### Biblical Revelation

Christian understanding of God's attributes begins with God's self-revelation in Scripture:

> "I am who I am." (Exodus 3:14)

The Bible progressively discloses God's nature through:
- Historical acts of redemption
- Prophetic proclamations
- Wisdom literature reflections
- Gospel accounts of Jesus Christ
- Apostolic teachings

### Theological Classifications

Traditional theology often classifies God's attributes in different ways:

1. **Incommunicable vs. Communicable Attributes**
   - Incommunicable: Properties unique to God (e.g., omnipotence, infinity)
   - Communicable: Qualities humans can reflect in limited ways (e.g., love, wisdom)

2. **Absolute vs. Relative Attributes**
   - Absolute: God's essential nature (e.g., self-existence, immutability)
   - Relative: God's relationship to creation (e.g., creator, redeemer)

3. **Natural vs. Moral Attributes**
   - Natural: Metaphysical properties (e.g., omniscience, omnipresence)
   - Moral: Ethical qualities (e.g., holiness, goodness)

4. **Via Negativa vs. Via Positiva**
   - Via Negativa: What God is not (e.g., not limited, not changing)
   - Via Positiva: What God is (e.g., loving, just)

### Tension in Understanding

Christian theology maintains creative tensions in understanding God's attributes:

- **Transcendence and Immanence**: God is both beyond creation and intimately present
- **Unity and Diversity**: Single divine nature expressing multiple attributes
- **Simplicity and Complexity**: God's attributes are not parts but different perspectives on one being
- **Known and Unknown**: Revelation makes God known while God remains ultimately mysterious

## Incommunicable Attributes

### Self-Existence (Aseity)

God's independence and self-sufficiency:

> "For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself." (John 5:26)

Key aspects include:
- God's existence depends on nothing outside himself
- All creation derives existence from God
- God is the source of all being
- God's name "I AM" reflects self-existence

### Eternality

## God's Attributes in Trinitarian Perspective

### Shared Divine Nature

Christian orthodoxy affirms that all divine attributes are fully possessed by each Person of the Trinity:

> "All that belongs to the Father is mine." (John 16:15)

Each Person:
- Possesses the complete divine nature
- Manifests all divine attributes
- Is fully God in every respect

### Distinctive Personal Expression

Different divine attributes are distinctly expressed through each Person:

- **Father**: Often associated with creation, authority, and providence
- **Son**: Particularly reveals divine love, wisdom, and redemptive power
- **Holy Spirit**: Especially manifests divine presence, power, and sanctifying work

### Economic and Immanent Trinity

Attributes function in both eternal relations and temporal missions:
- Immanent Trinity: Eternal relationships between divine Persons
- Economic Trinity: How each Person relates to creation and redemption

## Theological Developments and Debates

### Classical vs. Open Theism

Contemporary debates about divine foreknowledge:

- **Classical Theism**: God knows all future events, including free choices
- **Open Theism**: God knows all possibilities but not all future free choices
- Points of contention:
  - Meaning of divine omniscience
  - Relationship between sovereignty and human freedom
  - Biblical interpretation of God "changing mind" or "responding"

### Impassibility

Historical discussions about God's emotional life:

- **Traditional View**: God is not subject to suffering or emotional change
- **Contemporary Modifications**: God experiences emotions analogous to human feelings, but without imperfection or loss of control
- Central questions:
  - Biblical language about divine emotions
  - Implications of incarnation for divine experience
  - Relationship between love and vulnerability

### Divine Simplicity

Medieval doctrine with ongoing significance:

- **Traditional Doctrine**: God is not composed of parts; each attribute is identical with God's essence
- **Implications**:
  - Attributes are not separate components
  - No distinction between what God is and what God has
  - No potential/actual distinction in God
- Contemporary discussions about coherence and biblical basis

## Denominational Emphases

### Eastern Orthodox

Orthodox theology emphasizes:
- Distinction between divine essence and energies
