# Evangelical Theology

![Evangelical theological tradition](evangelical_theology.jpg)

Evangelical theology represents a significant Protestant theological movement emphasizing the authority of Scripture, personal conversion, the centrality of the cross, and active Christian witness. Rather than a single denominational tradition, evangelicalism is a transdenominational movement that has influenced multiple Christian bodies while maintaining core theological convictions. It is characterized by its focus on the "good news" (evangel) of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, biblical authority, personal relationship with God, and commitment to sharing the Christian message.

## Historical Development
