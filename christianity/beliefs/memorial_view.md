# Memorial View of the Lord's Supper

![Communion table with bread and cup](memorial_view.jpg)

The Memorial View (also called the Symbolic or Zwinglian View) is a theological position regarding the Lord's Supper/Communion/Eucharist that understands the sacrament primarily as a commemorative act remembering Christ's sacrifice rather than a means of grace or vehicle of Christ's real presence. This perspective, most prominently associated with the Swiss Reformer Huldrych Zwingli (1484-1531), has become dominant among many evangelical, Baptist, and other Protestant denominations, emphasizing the symbolic and memorial aspects of the ordinance over its mystical or sacramental dimensions.

## Biblical Foundation

### Key Supporting Texts

The Memorial View draws primarily from Jesus' institution of the Lord's Supper:

**Luke 22:19**
> "And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, 'This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.'"

The Greek phrase "εἰς τὴν ἐμὴν ἀνάμνησιν" ("in remembrance of me") is central to the Memorial View, emphasizing commemoration.

**1 Corinthians 11:23-26**
> "For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.' For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."

Proponents emphasize the proclamation aspect ("you proclaim the Lord's death") and the memorial dimension ("in remembrance").

### Interpretive Principles

Memorial View adherents interpret the biblical texts with several hermeneutical approaches:

- **Symbolic Understanding**: "This is my body" interpreted as metaphorical language
- **Contextual Reading**: Jesus physically present at institution means "is" cannot be literal
- **Biblical Parallels**: Other "I am" statements of Jesus (door, vine, etc.) understood figuratively
- **Hebrew Background**: Passover context suggests symbolic rather than literal meaning
- **Spiritual Focus**: John 6:63 ("the Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing") used to argue against physical/literal interpretations

## Historical Development

### Patristic and Medieval Period

While the Memorial View is primarily a Reformation development:
- Early church practice emphasized the communal meal and remembrance aspects
- Elements of symbolic understanding appeared in some church fathers
- Medieval period saw increasing emphasis on real presence and transubstantiation
- Various minor movements questioned literal interpretations
- Official doctrine crystallized around transubstantiation at Fourth Lateran Council (1215)

### Reformation Era

The Memorial View emerged distinctly during the Protestant Reformation:

**Zwingli's Formulation**:
- Rejected both Catholic transubstantiation and Lutheran consubstantiation
- Emphasized commemorative action and church community
- Understood "is" in institution narrative as "signifies"
- Viewed communion as primarily an act of confession and remembrance
- Located real presence in the believing community, not the elements

**Marburg Colloquy (1529)**:
- Luther and Zwingli's famous debate over the Lord's Supper
- Central disagreement over literal vs. figurative interpretation of "This is my body"
- Luther insisted on Christ's real presence; Zwingli advocated memorial understanding
- Failure to reach agreement divided Protestant movement
- Established distinctive paths for Lutheran and Reformed sacramental theology

### Post-Reformation Development

Following Zwingli, the Memorial View evolved through several stages:
- **Reformed Development**: Calvin attempted mediating position between Luther and Zwingli
- **Radical Reformation**: Anabaptists generally adopted memorial understanding
- **English Reformation**: Various positions with some groups embracing memorial view
- **Puritan Influence**: Emphasized worthy participation and spiritual preparation
- **Baptist Adoption**: Became standard view among Baptist movements

## Theological Framework

### Core Tenets

The Memorial View affirms several key theological principles:

- **Commemoration**: Primary purpose is remembering Christ's sacrifice
- **Symbolism**: Elements represent but do not contain or become Christ's body/blood
- **Obedience**: Observance fulfills Christ's command to remember
- **Proclamation**: Visibly demonstrates the gospel to participants and witnesses
- **Spiritual Communion**: Fellowship with Christ occurs through faith, not physical elements
- **Community Expression**: Corporate dimension emphasizes church unity
- **Testimony**: Public profession of faith and commitment

### Theological Distinctions

The Memorial View differs from other positions in several ways:

**Contrast with Transubstantiation** (Roman Catholic):
- Rejects change of substance in elements
- Denies sacrificial character of the Eucharist
- Emphasizes memorial rather than re-presentation of Christ's sacrifice
- Places authority in Scripture rather than church tradition
- Views ministerial role as facilitator rather than priest

**Contrast with Consubstantiation** (Lutheran):
- Rejects Christ's bodily presence "in, with, and under" the elements
- Views benefits as coming through remembrance, not physical reception
- Emphasizes subjective commemoration rather than objective presence
- Understands "is" figuratively rather than literally
- Focuses on past historical event rather than present encounter

**Contrast with Spiritual Presence** (Calvinist/Reformed):
- Less emphasis on sacrament as means of grace
- More emphasis on human activity of remembrance
- Little or no concept of objective spiritual presence in elements
- Primarily horizontal (communal) rather than vertical (divine) encounter
- Commemorates past event more than mediating present reality

### Theological Integration

The Memorial View connects with other doctrines:

**Christology**:
- Emphasis on Christ's physical absence from earth during church age
- Focus on completed historical work rather than continuing presence
- Affirmation of Christ's humanity being limited to heaven until return
- Remembrance as appropriate response to Christ's once-for-all sacrifice

**Ecclesiology**:
- Communion as expression of church community and unity
- Ordinance of the church rather than transformative sacrament
- Congregation as active participants rather than recipients
- Church as commemorating community rather than mediating institution

**Pneumatology**:
- Spirit's role in bringing remembrance rather than transforming elements
- Spiritual presence through Holy Spirit rather than physical presence
- Communion as occasion for spiritual reflection guided by Spirit
- Spirit working through mental/emotional response rather than material elements

## Denominational Perspectives

### Baptist Tradition

Baptists typically hold the Memorial View with these emphases:
- Communion as ordinance rather than sacrament
- Local church autonomy in frequency and practice
- Believer's communion paralleling believer's baptism
- Importance of self-examination and worthy participation
- Deacons and pastors as administrators rather than priests

### Anabaptist Heritage

Anabaptist groups (Mennonites, Brethren, etc.) emphasize:
- Communion as covenant renewal ceremony
- Community dimension highlighting peace and reconciliation
- Connection between communion and footwashing
- Simplicity of observance without elaborate ritual
- Frequency often less than other traditions (quarterly common)

### Free Church Traditions

Various evangelical and free church groups maintain:
- Emphasis on individual conscience in participation
- Flexible liturgical approaches rather than fixed forms
- Often practice "open communion" welcoming all believers
- Educational emphasis explaining meaning before observance
- Practical, understandable symbolism over mystery

### Pentecostal/Charismatic

These traditions typically follow Memorial View while adding:
- Potential for healing associated with worthy participation
- Opportunity for prophetic ministry during communion
- Emotional and experiential dimensions of remembrance
- Connection between communion and spiritual warfare
- Dynamic rather than static understanding of memorial

## Practical Dimensions

### Liturgical Practice

Memorial View communion typically features:
- Simple explanation of meaning before observance
- Informal liturgy with minimal fixed elements
- Emphasis on Scripture reading of institution narratives
- Prayers focusing on thankfulness and remembrance
- Often includes time of examination and confession

### Frequency and Timing

Patterns vary widely:
- Monthly observance most common
- Some observe quarterly
- Some practice weekly (Churches of Christ)
- Special occasions (church covenant renewals, retreats)
- Flexibility of timing within worship service

### Elements and Administration

Typical practices include:
- Unleavened bread or crackers
- Grape juice (especially in temperance-influenced traditions) rather than wine
- Individual cups becoming common after 19th century
- Deacons and/or pastors serving congregation
- Passing elements through congregation rather than coming forward

### Preparation and Participation

Memorial View traditions emphasize:
- Self-examination based on 1 Corinthians 11
- Educational preparation especially for first communion
- Reconciliation with others before participating
- Congregation often seated together rather than coming forward
- Corporate rather than individual reception

## Contemporary Issues

### Ecumenical Considerations

Memorial View presents both challenges and opportunities:
- Significant barrier to full communion with sacramental traditions
- Common ground with other traditions in commemorative aspects
- Participation in interdenominational communion requires flexibility
- Questions about mutual recognition of different understandings
- Growing appreciation for diverse theological perspectives

### Cultural Adaptations

Contemporary practice includes adaptations:
- Pre-packaged communion elements for convenience/hygiene
- Online communion during pandemic raising theological questions
- Balancing accessibility with reverence
- Addressing food allergies (gluten-free options)
- Incorporating contemporary language while maintaining biblical fidelity

### Theological Reconsideration

Some within Memorial View traditions are exploring:
- Recovering more transformative understanding of remembrance
- Appreciating Eucharistic practices from broader Christian tradition
- Balancing memorial emphasis with experience of God's presence
- Addressing individualistic tendencies with stronger communal focus
- Exploring biblical concepts of memorial beyond mere mental recall

## Evaluation

### Strengths of the Memorial View

Proponents highlight several strengths:
- Biblical emphasis on remembrance and proclamation
- Accessibility and understandability for participants
- Protection against superstitious views of elements
- Strong emphasis on worthy participation and self-examination
- Focus on Christ's completed work rather than ongoing sacrifice

### Critiques and Limitations

Critics identify potential weaknesses:
- Potential reductionism regarding sacramental mystery
- Overemphasis on cognitive dimension over embodied experience
- Limited connection to historic church practice
- Tendency toward individualistic rather than communal understanding
- Possible diminishment of communion's role as means of grace

### Theological Nuance

Contemporary scholarship has developed more nuanced understandings:

- Appreciation that symbolism can convey reality, not just represent
- Understanding commemoration as active participation rather than passive recollection
- Recognition of communal dimension beyond individual remembrance
- Increased willingness to learn from other sacramental traditions
