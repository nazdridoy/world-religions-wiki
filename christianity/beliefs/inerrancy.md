# Biblical Inerrancy

![Bible study](inerrancy.jpg)

Biblical inerrancy is the theological view that the Bible is without error or fault in all its teaching. This doctrine addresses the authority, reliability, and trustworthiness of Scripture as God's revealed Word and has been a significant point of discussion and sometimes controversy throughout Christian history.

## Definition and Scope

### Formal Definition

Inerrancy is often formally defined as the belief that the Bible, in its original manuscripts (autographs), is completely true in all that it affirms or teaches, whether in matters of faith, history, science, geography, or any other discipline.

### Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978)

The Chicago Statement, a document created by evangelical scholars, provides a comprehensive articulation of inerrancy:

> "Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without error or fault in all its teaching, no less in what it states about God's acts in creation, about the events of world history, and about its own literary origins under God, than in its witness to God's saving grace in individual lives."

### Qualifications

Careful proponents of inerrancy typically include these important qualifications:

- Applies to the original manuscripts, not necessarily to copies or translations
- Acknowledges the Bible uses phenomenological language (describing appearances)
- Recognizes various literary genres requiring appropriate interpretation
- Allows for approximations, round numbers, and non-technical language
- Does not require modern precision in quotations or chronology
- Focuses on the intended meaning rather than incidental details

## Historical Development

### Early Church

Church fathers generally assumed the complete truthfulness of Scripture:

- **Justin Martyr** (100-165): Defended Scripture as completely harmonious
- **Irenaeus** (130-202): Taught that the Scriptures were without error
- **Augustine** (354-430): Famously wrote, "If we are perplexed by any apparent contradiction in Scripture, it is not allowable to say, 'The author of this book is mistaken,' but either the manuscript is faulty, or the translation is wrong, or you have not understood."

### Medieval Period

Medieval theologians maintained the church's high view of Scripture:

- **Thomas Aquinas** (1225-1274): Affirmed that "nothing false can underlie the literal sense of Scripture"
- **Scholastic theology**: Developed methods to explain apparent discrepancies while maintaining Scripture's truthfulness

### Reformation

The Reformers strongly emphasized Scripture's authority and reliability:

- **Martin Luther**: Despite his critical questions about some books' canonicity, maintained Scripture's truthfulness
- **John Calvin**: Described Scripture as the "infallible rule" and "unerring standard"
- **Protestant confessions**: Reformed and Lutheran confessions affirmed Scripture's complete authority and reliability

### Modern Period

The modern period saw more formal articulation and defense of inerrancy:

- **Princeton theologians** (19th century): Charles Hodge, B.B. Warfield, and others developed systematic defenses of inerrancy
- **Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy** (early 20th century): Inerrancy became a defining issue
- **Neo-evangelicalism** (mid-20th century): Reaffirmed inerrancy while engaging with modern scholarship
- **Chicago Statement** (1978): Articulated detailed evangelical position on inerrancy

## Theological Framework

### Relationship to Divine Inspiration

Inerrancy is closely tied to the doctrine of inspiration:

- Based on 2 Timothy 3:16 â€“ "All Scripture is God-breathed"
- Sees inerrancy as a logical consequence of divine authorship
- Maintains the dual authorship of Scripture (divine and human)

### Relationship to Other Doctrines

Inerrancy connects with several other theological concepts:

- **Divine truthfulness**: God cannot lie (Titus 1:2, Hebrews 6:18)
- **Biblical authority**: Inerrancy supports Scripture's authoritative role
- **Christology**: Jesus' high view of Scripture informs inerrancy
- **Ecclesiology**: Shapes how the church receives and interprets Scripture

## Denominational Views

### Conservative Evangelical/Fundamentalist

- Holds to full inerrancy in all matters
- Often views inerrancy as essential to Christian orthodoxy
- Includes Southern Baptists, many nondenominational churches, and conservative Presbyterians

### Moderate Evangelical

- Affirms inerrancy with careful qualifications
- Allows for more flexibility in interpretation of historical and scientific passages
- Includes many evangelical scholars and institutions

### Roman Catholic

- Official teaching affirms Scripture is without error in what the authors intended to affirm
- Vatican II: "The books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation"
- Emphasizes the role of church tradition in interpretation

### Eastern Orthodox

- Affirms Scripture's truthfulness but places less emphasis on technical distinctions of inerrancy
- Views Scripture within the broader context of Holy Tradition
- Emphasizes the Spirit's role in guiding the church's interpretation

### Mainline Protestant

- Often endorses "limited inerrancy" (Scripture inerrant in matters of faith and practice, not necessarily in historical or scientific details)
- May prefer terms like "infallibility" (Scripture accomplishes God's purpose) or "trustworthiness"
- Includes denominations like PCUSA, ELCA, and United Methodist Church

## Alternative Perspectives

### Infallibility

Some theologians distinguish between:
- **Inerrancy**: Scripture contains no errors of any kind
- **Infallibility**: Scripture will not fail in accomplishing its purpose of leading people to salvation

### Limited Inerrancy

This view holds that:
- The Bible is inerrant in matters of faith and practice
- It may contain errors in historical, scientific, or cultural matters
- These errors do not compromise its spiritual message

### Barthian Approach

Karl Barth's view:
- Scripture "becomes" the Word of God in encounter
- Rejected both liberal criticism and fundamentalist literalism
- Scripture witnesses to revelation rather than being revelation itself

## Challenges and Responses

### Critical Challenges

Critics of inerrancy point to:
1. **Apparent discrepancies**: Differences in parallel accounts
2. **Historical questions**: Details that seem to conflict with archaeology
3. **Scientific concerns**: Biblical descriptions that appear at odds with modern science
4. **Ethical problems**: Biblical practices that seem questionable by modern standards
5. **Textual variants**: Differences between manuscripts

### Common Responses

Defenders of inerrancy typically respond:
1. Many apparent contradictions can be resolved through careful interpretation
2. Archaeological discoveries have often confirmed biblical accounts
3. The Bible uses phenomenological language, not technical scientific descriptions
4. Ethical commands must be understood in their historical and revelatory context
5. Textual variants rarely affect significant doctrinal matters

## Contemporary Significance
