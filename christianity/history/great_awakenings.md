The Great Awakenings were a series of religious revival movements that swept through American society from the early 18th through the late 19th centuries. These periods of intense religious enthusiasm, emotional preaching, mass conversions, and social activism transformed American Christianity and significantly influenced American culture, politics, and social reform. Characterized by passionate preaching, outdoor revival meetings, and an emphasis on personal conversion experiences, the Awakenings democratized American Christianity, sparked new denominations, and established evangelicalism as a major force in American religious life, with reverberations that continue to the present day.
