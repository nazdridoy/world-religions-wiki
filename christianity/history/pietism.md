# Pietism

![Pietism](../../images/pietism.jpg)

Pietism was a reform movement within Protestantism that emerged in late 17th-century Germany, emphasizing personal faith, devotional reading of scripture, practical holiness, and active charity over intellectual doctrine and church formalism. Reacting against what it perceived as the cold orthodoxy and moral laxity of state churches, Pietism sought to revitalize Christianity through personal spiritual transformation, small group gatherings, and practical application of biblical principles. Its influence extended far beyond its German Lutheran origins to shape global Protestantism through its impact on evangelicalism, missions, social reform, and spiritual formation practices.

## Origins and Development

Pietism emerged from specific historical circumstances:

- **Thirty Years' War aftermath** (1618-1648): Reaction to spiritual devastation and moral decline following the conflict
- **Philip Jakob Spener** (1635-1705): Lutheran pastor whose book "Pia Desideria" (1675) outlined pietist reforms
- **Collegia pietatis**: Small devotional groups meeting in homes for Bible study, prayer, and mutual encouragement
- **University of Halle**: Academic center for pietism under August Hermann Francke
- **Württemberg pietism**: Distinctive southern German variant influenced by Johann Albrecht Bengel and Friedrich Christoph Oetinger
- **Moravian renewal**: Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf's community at Herrnhut
- **Early opposition**: Resistance from Lutheran orthodox theologians who viewed pietism as subjective and potentially separatist

## Core Principles and Practices

Pietism promoted several distinctive elements:

- **Experiential faith**: Emphasis on personal relationship with God rather than mere intellectual assent
- **New birth** (*Wiedergeburt*): Necessity of spiritual rebirth through conversion experience
- **Bible study**: Direct engagement with scripture by laity, not just clergy
- **Holy living**: Practical expression of faith through moral behavior and separation from "worldly" activities
- **Small group fellowship**: Ecclesiolae in ecclesia ("little churches within the church")
- **Universal priesthood**: Active participation of all believers in ministry
- **Social engagement**: Practical charity and establishment of schools, orphanages, and hospitals
- **Millennialism**: Belief in coming kingdom of God and need for preparation

## Key Figures

Several leaders shaped the pietist movement:

- **Johann Arndt** (1555-1621): Pre-pietist writer whose "True Christianity" influenced later pietists
- **Philip Jakob Spener** (1635-1705): "Father of Pietism" who outlined reform program
- **August Hermann Francke** (1663-1727): Established pietist center at Halle with schools and orphanage
- **Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf** (1700-1760): Founder of renewed Moravian Church with global mission focus
- **Johann Albrecht Bengel** (1687-1752): Biblical scholar who reconciled pietism with Lutheran orthodoxy
- **Gerhard Tersteegen** (1697-1769): Mystical poet and hymn writer
- **Friedrich Christoph Oetinger** (1702-1782): Württemberg theologian who integrated pietism with esoteric elements
