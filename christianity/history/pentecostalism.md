Pentecostalism is a dynamic Christian movement that emerged in the early 20th century, emphasizing direct personal experience of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Distinguished by its belief in speaking in tongues, prophetic gifts, and divine healing, Pentecostalism has grown from humble beginnings to become one of the fastest-growing religious movements in the world, with over 600 million adherents across denominations and continents.

## Origins and Early Development

### Historical Roots
Pentecostalism draws its name from the biblical event of Pentecost (Acts 2), when the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles, enabling them to speak in tongues. While the movement formally began in the early 20th century, it was preceded by several important developments:

- **Holiness Movement**: 19th-century Methodist-inspired emphasis on sanctification and spiritual perfection
- **Keswick "Higher Life" Movement**: British teaching on the baptism of the Holy Spirit for empowered service
- **Healing Revivals**: 19th-century ministries emphasizing divine healing through prayer
- **African American Spirituality**: Expressive worship traditions in Black churches

### Azusa Street Revival
The pivotal event in Pentecostal history was the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles (1906-1909). Led by African American preacher William J. Seymour, who had been influenced by Holiness preacher Charles Parham's teaching on speaking in tongues as evidence of Spirit baptism, the revival featured:

- Dramatic spiritual manifestations including glossolalia (speaking in tongues)
- Interracial and gender-inclusive worship in an era of segregation
- Continuous services running for nearly three years
- Visitors who carried the Pentecostal message worldwide

The revival's newspaper, *The Apostolic Faith*, spread Pentecostal teaching internationally, leading to a rapid expansion of the movement.

## Core Theological Distinctives

Pentecostalism is characterized by several distinctive theological emphases:

### Baptism in the Holy Spirit
Pentecostals believe in a distinct experience subsequent to conversion called the baptism in the Holy Spirit:
- Provides spiritual empowerment for Christian witness and service
- Typically accompanied by speaking in tongues as initial physical evidence
- Available to all believers who seek it

### Spiritual Gifts
Pentecostalism emphasizes the ongoing operation of all spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament:
- Speaking in tongues (glossolalia): Both as initial evidence of Spirit baptism and as ongoing prayer language
- Interpretation of tongues: Translating Spirit-inspired utterances
- Prophecy: Receiving direct divine communication
- Healing: Physical recovery through prayer and faith
- Discernment of spirits: Spiritual perception
- Miracles: Supernatural interventions beyond healing
- Words of knowledge and wisdom: Supernaturally revealed information

### Divine Healing
The belief that physical healing is provided in Christ's atonement:
- Prayer for the sick, often with anointing oil and laying on of hands
- Healing as a sign of God's power and confirmation of the gospel
- Healing evangelism and specialized healing ministries

### Eschatological Urgency
A strong focus on the imminent return of Christ:
- Premillennial views of Christ's second coming
- Evangelistic urgency driven by belief in imminent end times
- Triumphant expectation of final victory

## Denominational Development

From its origins, Pentecostalism spread rapidly, forming various denominational structures:

### Classical Pentecostal Denominations
The earliest organized Pentecostal groups:
- **Assemblies of God**: Founded in 1914, now the world's largest Pentecostal denomination with over 69 million members globally
- **Church of God in Christ**: Predominantly African American Pentecostal denomination, the largest in the United States
- **International Church of the Foursquare Gospel**: Founded by evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson in 1927
- **Pentecostal Holiness Church**: Emerged from the Holiness movement in the southeastern United States

### Oneness Pentecostalism
A significant theological division emerged around 1914 over the doctrine of the Trinity:
- Rejected Trinitarian theology in favor of a modalistic understanding of God
- Emphasized baptism in Jesus' name only rather than Trinitarian formula
- Major denominations include United Pentecostal Church International and Pentecostal Assemblies of the World

### Charismatic Movement
Beginning in the 1960s, Pentecostal experiences spread into mainline Protestant and Catholic churches:
- Episcopal priest Dennis Bennett's 1960 testimony of Spirit baptism marked the movement's beginning
- Catholic Charismatic Renewal emerged following the Second Vatican Council
- Allowed Pentecostal spirituality to influence traditional denominations without requiring denominational switching

### Third Wave/Neo-Charismatic Movement
From the 1980s onward, a new wave of Spirit-emphasis emerged:
- Less focused on tongues as initial evidence
- Incorporated "power evangelism" and spiritual warfare concepts
- Emphasized signs and wonders in evangelism
- Represented by Vineyard churches and many independent congregations

## Global Expansion

Perhaps Pentecostalism's most remarkable feature is its explosive growth across the Global South:

### Latin America
