Indigenous Christianity represents the diverse expressions of Christian faith that have emerged when the gospel encounters and takes root within native cultures worldwide. Rather than simply adopting Western forms of Christianity, indigenous believers have interpreted and expressed Christian faith through their own cultural frameworks, languages, symbols, and social structures. These contextual expressions of Christianity reflect both theological creativity and cultural resilience, as indigenous communities negotiate complex relationships between traditional spirituality, colonial legacies, and Christian identity.
