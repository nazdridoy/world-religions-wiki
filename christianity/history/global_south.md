Christianity has undergone a dramatic demographic shift in the 20th and 21st centuries, with its center of gravity moving from the Global North (Europe and North America) to the Global South (Africa, Asia, and Latin America). This transformation represents one of the most significant developments in Christian history, as regions once considered mission fields have become new centers of Christian vitality, growth, and theological innovation. The rise of Global South Christianity has profound implications for Christian theology, practice, leadership, and global influence.

## The Demographic Shift

The numerical center of Christianity has moved decisively southward:

- **Latin American expansion**: From predominantly Catholic to increasingly diverse Christian landscape
- **Asian growth**: Significant Christian communities in South Korea, China, India, and the Philippines
- **Decline in traditional strongholds**: Decreasing church attendance and affiliation in Europe
- **Projections**: By 2050, potentially 3/4 of Christians will live in Africa, Asia, and Latin America
- **Urban concentration**: Particularly strong growth in cities across the Global South
