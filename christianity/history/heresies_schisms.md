# Heresies and Schisms in Christianity

![Heresy and Schism](../../images/heresies_schisms.jpg)

Throughout Christian history, theological disagreements have led to both heresies (officially condemned doctrinal deviations) and schisms (formal separations between church bodies). These divisions have profoundly shaped Christian development, influencing theological formulations, institutional structures, and cultural expressions of faith. Understanding these controversies provides insight into how Christian orthodoxy developed and how the current denominational landscape emerged.

## Early Christological Heresies (2nd-5th Centuries)

The early church faced several challenges regarding Christ's nature:

- **Docetism**: Taught that Jesus only "seemed" to have a physical body (from Greek *dokeo*, "to seem"), denying his full humanity
- **Arianism**: Founded by Arius (c. 256-336), taught that Christ was created by God and not fully divine
- **Apollinarianism**: Promoted by Apollinaris of Laodicea (c. 310-390), claimed Jesus had a divine mind but human body
- **Nestorianism**: Associated with Nestorius (c. 386-450), emphasized the distinction between Christ's human and divine natures
- **Eutychianism/Monophysitism**: Founded by Eutyches (c. 380-456), taught that Christ had only one nature (divine), not two
- **Monothelitism**: Claimed Christ had two natures but only one will

These controversies prompted the first seven ecumenical councils, which formulated orthodox Christology.

## Trinitarian Controversies

Debates about the Trinity emerged alongside Christological disputes:

- **Sabellianism/Modalism**: Taught that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are different modes of one God rather than distinct persons
- **Macedonianism**: Denied the full divinity of the Holy Spirit
- **Tritheism**: Over-emphasized the distinction between divine persons, suggesting three gods rather than one

## Soteriological Controversies

Debates about salvation also divided Christians:

- **Pelagianism**: Originated with Pelagius (c. 354-418), denied original sin and emphasized human ability to achieve salvation without grace
- **Semi-Pelagianism**: Modified Pelagianism, acknowledging human depravity but maintaining some human initiative in salvation
- **Predestinarianism**: Various forms of extreme determinism regarding salvation

## The Great Schism (1054)

The most significant division in early Christianity was between Eastern and Western churches:

- **Contributing factors**:
  - Political divisions between Eastern (Byzantine) and Western (Roman) Empires
  - Cultural differences (Greek vs. Latin language and thought)
  - Theological disputes (particularly the *filioque* clause added to the Nicene Creed)
  - Jurisdictional conflicts between Rome and Constantinople
  - Liturgical differences in practice and emphasis

- **Official split**: Mutual excommunications between Pope Leo IX's representatives and Patriarch Michael Cerularius in 1054

- **Aftermath**: 
  - Development of separate Orthodox and Catholic traditions
  - Further attempts at reconciliation (Councils of Lyon and Florence)
  - Temporary reunion during Crusader conquest of Constantinople (1204-1261)
  - Modern ecumenical dialogues and partial healing (mutual lifting of excommunications in 1965)

## Medieval Heresies and Reform Movements

The medieval period saw various movements challenging church authority:

- **Catharism/Albigensianism**: Dualistic movement in southern France
- **Waldensians**: Founded by Peter Waldo (c. 1140-1205), emphasized apostolic poverty and lay preaching
- **Lollardy**: Associated with John Wycliffe (c. 1320-1384), emphasized scripture over tradition
- **Hussitism**: Followers of Jan Hus (c. 1369-1415), precursor to Protestant reforms

Many reform movements were initially intended to purify the church rather than separate from it.

## The Protestant Reformation

The 16th century saw the most dramatic fragmentation of Western Christianity:

- **Lutheran Reformation**: Led by Martin Luther (1483-1546), emphasized justification by faith alone
- **Reformed/Calvinist movement**: Led by John Calvin (1509-1564) and Huldrych Zwingli (1484-1531)
- **English Reformation**: Began under Henry VIII for political reasons but developed theological distinctives
- **Radical Reformation**: Anabaptists, Spiritualists, and other groups seeking more thorough reforms

Key theological issues included:
- Authority (scripture vs. tradition)
- Salvation (faith vs. works)
- Sacraments (especially the Eucharist)
- Church structure (priesthood of all believers vs. clerical hierarchy)

## Post-Reformation Divisions

After the Reformation, further divisions emerged:

- **Within Lutheranism**: Disputes over adiaphora (non-essential matters)
- **Within Reformed churches**: Conflicts over predestination (Arminianism vs. strict Calvinism)
- **Within Anglicanism**: High Church, Low Church, and Broad Church movements
- **Puritan movement**: Seeking further reforms in England and eventually America

## Modern Schisms

The modern era brought new divisions:

- **Old Catholic schism**: Following the First Vatican Council's definition of papal infallibility (1870)
- **Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy**: Early 20th century dispute over biblical interpretation and modern scholarship
- **Orthodox divisions**: Various national and jurisdictional splits
- **Liberation theology debates**: Tensions over social justice and political engagement
- **Contemporary denominational splits over sexuality**: Particularly in Anglican, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Methodist traditions

## Eastern Christian Schisms

The Eastern churches have experienced their own divisions:

- **Oriental Orthodox separation**: Following the Council of Chalcedon (451)
- **Church of the East**: Separated earlier, eventually called "Nestorian" (though inaccurately)
- **Old Believers**: Split from Russian Orthodox Church over liturgical reforms (17th century)
- **Autocephaly disputes**: Conflicts over independence of national churches

## Heresy vs. Schism: Understanding the Difference

Important distinctions clarify these two concepts:

- **Heresy**: Doctrinal error officially condemned by church authority
- **Schism**: Organizational separation without necessarily involving doctrinal difference
- **Ecclesiastical context**: What constitutes "heresy" depends on which church authority one recognizes
- **Historical reevaluation**: Modern scholarship and ecumenical dialogue have reassessed many historical condemnations

## Impact on Christian Development

These controversies have shaped Christianity in various ways:

- **Doctrinal refinement**: Heresies often prompted clearer articulation of orthodox teaching
- **Institutional development**: Need to combat heresy strengthened church structures
- **Theological diversity**: Different emphases enriched Christian thought
- **Cultural expressions**: Different traditions developed distinct liturgies, art, and spirituality
- **Ecumenical movements**: Modern efforts to heal divisions while respecting differences
