# The Life of Jesus

![Jesus of Nazareth](../../images/life_of_jesus.jpg)

Jesus of Nazareth (approximately 4 BCE â€“ 30/33 CE) is the central figure of Christianity. His life, teachings, death, and reported resurrection form the foundation of Christian faith and practice. This overview examines what is known about the historical Jesus and his significance in the development of Christianity.

## Sources on Jesus's Life

Our primary sources for Jesus's life are the four canonical Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), written between 30-100 years after his death. These texts present theological interpretations alongside historical accounts. Non-Christian sources from the period, such as the Jewish historian Josephus and Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, briefly mention Jesus but provide limited independent information.

Modern historical scholarship attempts to distinguish between the "historical Jesus" (what can be verified through historical methods) and the "Christ of faith" (theological interpretations of Jesus's significance).

## Birth and Early Life

According to the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, Jesus was born in Bethlehem to Mary, who conceived through the Holy Spirit. His birth is traditionally placed around 4 BCE, during the reign of Herod the Great. Little is known about Jesus's childhood beyond the account of his birth and a single story of him teaching in the Temple at age 12 (Luke 2:41-52).

The Gospels indicate Jesus grew up in Nazareth, a small Galilean town, where he likely worked as a carpenter or craftsman like his earthly father, Joseph.

## Ministry and Teaching

Jesus began his public ministry around age 30, following his baptism by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. His ministry lasted approximately 3 years (though estimates vary), primarily in Galilee and Judea.

Key elements of Jesus's teaching included:

- Proclamation of the coming Kingdom of God
- Ethical teachings emphasizing love, compassion, and justice
- Parables using everyday scenarios to convey spiritual truths
- Reinterpretation of Jewish law focusing on inner intent rather than external compliance
- Teachings about his own identity and relationship with God

Jesus gathered a group of disciples who traveled with him, with an inner circle of twelve apostles who would later lead the early church.

## Miracles and Actions

The Gospels record numerous miracles attributed to Jesus, including:

- Healing the sick and disabled
- Exorcising demons
- Controlling natural elements (calming storms, walking on water)
- Feeding multitudes with minimal food
- Raising the dead

Jesus also performed symbolic actions that carried religious significance, such as cleansing the Temple in Jerusalem of merchants and money-changers.

## Final Days and Crucifixion

Jesus's ministry culminated in his final journey to Jerusalem during Passover. After entering the city to crowds welcoming him as a messianic figure, he shared a final meal (the Last Supper) with his disciples, establishing what would become the Christian sacrament of Communion or Eucharist.

Following his arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus was tried by Jewish religious authorities and then by the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate. He was sentenced to death by crucifixion, a common Roman punishment for political insurgents. The Gospels place his death on a Friday, just before the Jewish Sabbath.

## Resurrection and Appearances

The central claim of early Christianity was that Jesus rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion. The Gospels report that women discovered his empty tomb, after which Jesus appeared to his disciples over a period of forty days.

These resurrection appearances convinced his followers that he had conquered death and was truly the Messiah and Son of God. This belief formed the foundation of the emerging Christian faith.

## Historical and Religious Significance

Jesus's life marks a pivotal point in world history, leading to the formation of Christianity, which would become the world's largest religion. His teachings continue to influence ethics, philosophy, law, and culture globally.

For Christians, Jesus represents:
- The incarnation of God in human form
- The fulfillment of Jewish messianic prophecies
- The perfect example of human life lived in accordance with God's will
- The savior who atones for human sin through his death and resurrection
