# Constantine and the Legalization of Christianity

![Constantine the Great](../../images/constantine.jpg)

Constantine the Great (272-337 CE) was the Roman Emperor whose conversion to Christianity and subsequent policies transformed the religion from a persecuted minority faith to the favored religion of the Roman Empire. His reign marks one of the most significant turning points in Christian history, setting the stage for Christianity to become a dominant world religion.

## Constantine's Rise to Power

Born in Naissus (modern-day Niš, Serbia), Constantine was the son of Constantius Chlorus, who became Western Roman Emperor in 305 CE. Following his father's death in 306, Constantine was proclaimed emperor by his troops, though he initially ruled only Britain, Gaul, and Spain. After years of civil war against rival claimants, including Maxentius and Licinius, Constantine eventually emerged as sole emperor of both the Western and Eastern Roman Empire by 324 CE.

## The Battle of Milvian Bridge and Conversion

The pivotal moment in Constantine's religious journey came before the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312 CE. According to the Christian historian Eusebius, Constantine received a vision of a cross of light above the sun, accompanied by the words "In this sign, conquer" (In Hoc Signo Vinces). He ordered his soldiers to mark their shields with the Chi-Rho symbol (☧), representing the first two letters of "Christ" in Greek.

After his victory at Milvian Bridge against Maxentius, Constantine attributed his success to the Christian God and began his gradual embrace of Christianity. While the exact nature and timing of Constantine's conversion remain debated by historians, the consequences of his new religious affiliation were profound.

## The Edict of Milan (313 CE)

In 313 CE, Constantine and his co-emperor Licinius issued the Edict of Milan, which proclaimed religious tolerance throughout the empire. The edict specifically ended the persecution of Christians and restored confiscated church property. While not making Christianity the state religion, the edict transformed Christianity's legal status from a persecuted sect to a permitted religion (religio licita).

This legal protection allowed Christianity to flourish openly for the first time, leading to rapid growth and the ability to establish formal institutions.

## Imperial Patronage of Christianity

Once in power, Constantine actively supported the Christian church through:

- Financing the construction of churches throughout the empire, including the original St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem
- Granting legal privileges and tax exemptions to clergy
- Returning and donating property to Christian communities
- Appointing Christians to high government positions
- Supporting church councils to resolve doctrinal disputes

Constantine also incorporated Christian symbols into imperial imagery and created a new Christian capital at Byzantium, renamed Constantinople (modern Istanbul), designed as a "New Rome" with prominent Christian elements.

## The Council of Nicaea

In 325 CE, Constantine convened the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea, bringing together bishops from throughout the empire to address theological conflicts, particularly the Arian controversy concerning the nature of Christ. By facilitating this council, Constantine established the precedent of imperial involvement in church affairs and promoted doctrinal unity.

The council produced the Nicene Creed, which affirmed the doctrine of the Trinity and became the foundation of orthodox Christian belief across most denominations.

## Constantine's Baptism and Legacy

Despite his support for Christianity, Constantine delayed his baptism until shortly before his death in 337 CE, a common practice at the time based on the belief that baptism cleansed all previous sins.

Constantine's legacy transformed Christianity from a minority, persecuted religion to one with imperial backing and growing influence. His policies set Christianity on the path to becoming the dominant religion of the Roman Empire, which was formalized under Emperor Theodosius I, who made Christianity the official state religion in 380 CE.

Constantine's fusion of imperial authority with Christian faith established the "Constantinian model" of church-state relations that would dominate Europe for over a millennium and continues to influence Christian political thought today.
