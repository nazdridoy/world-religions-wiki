Latin American Christianity represents one of the most significant regional expressions of the Christian faith globally. From the colonial-era evangelization by Catholic missionaries to contemporary Pentecostal growth, Christianity in Latin America has been characterized by vibrant popular religiosity, distinctive theological developments, and profound social engagement. This complex religious landscape has been shaped by indigenous cultural traditions, European influences, African spiritual elements, and more recently, indigenous-led Christian movements and North American evangelical missions. Today, while traditionally Catholic, the region exhibits increasing religious pluralism while continuing to influence global Christianity through its theological contributions and missionary expansion.
