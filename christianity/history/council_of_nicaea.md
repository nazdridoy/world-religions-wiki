# The Council of Nicaea

The First Council of Nicaea, held in 325 CE in the city of Nicaea (modern Iznik, Turkey), was the first ecumenical council in the history of Christianity. Convened by Emperor Constantine I, this gathering of bishops from across the Roman Empire addressed crucial theological controversies, established core doctrines, and marked the beginning of a new era in which Christianity enjoyed imperial favor and institutional development.

## Background and Context

Following Constantine's legalization of Christianity through the Edict of Milan (313 CE), the Christian church faced internal theological disputes that threatened its unity. Chief among these was the Arian controversy, a debate about the nature of Christ and his relationship to God the Father.

Arius, a presbyter from Alexandria, taught that the Son (Jesus Christ) was created by the Father and therefore not coeternal or consubstantial with him. This view, known as Arianism, was opposed by Bishop Alexander of Alexandria and his successor Athanasius, who maintained that the Son was of the same substance (homoousios) as the Father and equally divine.

As the controversy spread and threatened imperial unity, Constantine, who valued religious harmony in his empire, called approximately 300 bishops to Nicaea to resolve the dispute.

## Proceedings and Participants

The council was attended by bishops primarily from the Eastern provinces, though Western Christianity was also represented. Notable participants included:

- Hosius of Cordova, who may have presided as the emperor's representative
- Alexander of Alexandria and his deacon Athanasius (who would become the foremost defender of Nicene orthodoxy)
- Eusebius of Caesarea, the church historian
- Eusebius of Nicomedia, who supported Arius

Constantine opened the council and participated in some discussions, though not being a theologian himself, he primarily sought consensus rather than imposing specific theological views.

## The Nicene Creed

The council's most enduring achievement was the formulation of the original Nicene Creed, which explicitly rejected Arianism and affirmed:

- The Son is "begotten, not made"
- The Son is "of one substance with the Father" (homoousios to Patri)
- The Son was "incarnate" and "made human"

This creed became the first universal statement of Christian orthodoxy and remains foundational for most Christian denominations today, though it would be expanded at the First Council of Constantinople in 381 CE into what is now commonly called the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed.

## Other Decisions

Beyond addressing Arianism, the Council of Nicaea also:

1. **Established a uniform date for Easter**: The council decreed that Easter should be celebrated on the same day throughout the Church, specifically the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox.

2. **Created canons for church governance**: Twenty canons (church rules) were issued, dealing with matters such as:
   - The status and ordination of clergy
   - Rules for penance and reconciliation of lapsed Christians
   - The organization of provincial synods
   - The primacy of certain episcopal sees (Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch)

3. **Addressed the Meletian schism**: This was a controversy in Egypt involving a bishop who had ordained priests during the persecution era when he arguably lacked authority to do so.

## Aftermath and Significance

Despite the council's decision, the Arian controversy persisted for decades. Some emperors after Constantine favored Arianism, and several Germanic peoples who were converted to Christianity adopted the Arian form of the faith.

Nevertheless, the Council of Nicaea established important precedents:

- It demonstrated the emperor's role in church affairs, establishing the pattern of church-state relations that would define much of later Christian history
- It established ecumenical councils as authoritative for resolving doctrinal disputes
- It began the process of codifying Christian doctrine into formal creeds and canons
- It helped transform Christianity from a loosely organized collection of local churches into an institution with defined structures and beliefs

The Council of Nicaea is thus widely regarded as one of the most significant events in Christian history, marking the church's transition from a persecuted minority to an imperial religion with formal doctrines and structures.
