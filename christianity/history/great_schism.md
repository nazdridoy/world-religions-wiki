# The Great Schism of 1054

![Great Schism](../../images/great_schism.jpg)

The Great Schism of 1054 refers to the formal separation between Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Roman Catholic) Christianity. This momentous division, which continues to the present day, resulted from centuries of growing theological, political, cultural, and ecclesiastical differences between the Greek East and Latin West, culminating in mutual excommunications that formalized the breach in Christian unity.

## Historical Background

Though often dated to 1054, the Great Schism was actually the culmination of a long process of estrangement that began centuries earlier. Several factors contributed to this growing division:

- **Political Division**: The split of the Roman Empire into Eastern and Western halves in the 4th century created different political contexts for Christianity.
- **Language and Culture**: The East used Greek while the West used Latin, leading to different theological vocabularies and cultural expressions of the faith.
- **Barbarian Invasions**: The collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century further isolated Western Christianity from the East.
- **Rise of the Papacy**: The Bishop of Rome (the Pope) increasingly claimed universal jurisdiction, which Eastern patriarchs rejected.
- **Carolingian Empire**: The crowning of Charlemagne as "Emperor of the Romans" in 800 CE by Pope Leo III challenged Byzantine claims to be the sole inheritors of the Roman legacy.

## Theological Differences

Several theological disputes contributed to the schism:

1. **The Filioque Controversy**: The Western church added the word "filioque" ("and from the Son") to the Nicene Creed, indicating that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son. The Eastern church viewed this as both theologically problematic and an unauthorized unilateral change to a universal creed.

2. **Papal Authority**: The West developed the doctrine of papal supremacy, claiming the Bishop of Rome had universal jurisdiction over all Christians. The East maintained a more collegial view of church governance through the Pentarchy (the five ancient patriarchal sees of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem).

3. **Liturgical Differences**: Divergences in liturgical practices grew, including the Western use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist versus the Eastern use of leavened bread.

4. **Clerical Celibacy**: The Western church increasingly required priestly celibacy, while the Eastern church allowed married men to become priests (though bishops were chosen from celibate clergy).

## The Events of 1054

The immediate trigger for the formal break came when Pope Leo IX sent Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida to Constantinople to address tensions with Patriarch Michael Cerularius. The legation ended disastrously:

- Disagreements over church practices in Southern Italy (where both Greek and Latin rites were practiced)
- Patriarch Cerularius's closure of Latin churches in Constantinople
- Cardinal Humbert's imperious attitude and mishandling of negotiations

On July 16, 1054, Humbert placed a bull of excommunication on the altar of Hagia Sophia during the Divine Liturgy, excommunicating Patriarch Cerularius and his followers. In response, Cerularius convened a synod that excommunicated the papal legates (though not the pope himself, who had actually died before the excommunication was delivered).

## Aftermath and Impact

Initially, the schism of 1054 was not seen as permanent or absolute. At the local level, ordinary believers often remained unaware of the breach. Communications between Rome and Constantinople continued, and attempts at reconciliation were made at the Second Council of Lyon (1274) and the Council of Florence (1439), though these ultimately failed.

The schism became more entrenched after:

- The Fourth Crusade (1204), when Western Crusaders sacked Constantinople
- The fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453
- The Protestant Reformation, which shifted Western Christian concerns away from East-West unity

The schism resulted in two distinct branches of Christianity:

- **Eastern Orthodoxy**: Emphasizing tradition, the role of the Holy Spirit in the church, mystical theology, and governance through councils
- **Roman Catholicism**: Emphasizing papal authority, scholastic theology, and centralized governance

## Modern Ecumenical Relations

In the 20th century, significant steps toward reconciliation occurred:

- Mutual lifting of excommunications in 1965 by Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras
- Joint theological commissions and dialogues
- Fraternal visits between popes and patriarchs

Despite improved relations, significant issues continue to divide the churches, particularly regarding papal primacy and jurisdiction. The Great Schism thus remains an unhealed wound in Christianity, though no longer marked by the hostility of previous centuries.
