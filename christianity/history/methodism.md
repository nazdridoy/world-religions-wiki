# Methodism

![Methodism](../../images/methodism.jpg)

Methodism began as an 18th-century movement within the Church of England, led by John and Charles Wesley, that emphasized personal faith, methodical study of scripture, holiness of life, and social responsibility. Through its distinctive emphasis on experiential faith, systematic spiritual development, and concern for the poor, Methodism grew from a small society at Oxford University into one of the largest Protestant denominations worldwide. Its theological and organizational innovations have significantly influenced global Christianity, particularly in its approach to evangelism, social reform, and lay leadership.

## Origins and Early Development

Methodism emerged from specific historical circumstances:

- **Oxford Holy Club** (1729): John and Charles Wesley, George Whitefield and others formed a society at Oxford University for spiritual growth and service
- **Aldersgate experience** (1738): John Wesley's transformative spiritual experience where he felt his heart "strangely warmed"
- **Field preaching**: Adoption of open-air preaching after being excluded from many Anglican pulpits
- **Society organization**: Formation of methodical small groups for accountability and spiritual growth
- **Arminian theology**: Wesley's emphasis on free will and universal atonement (against Calvinist predestination)
- **Lay preaching**: Authorization of non-ordained preachers to expand the movement
- **Class meetings**: Small accountability groups that became the signature structure of early Methodism

## Key Figures

Several individuals shaped the Methodist movement:

- **John Wesley** (1703-1791): Primary founder, organizer, and theologian who remained an Anglican priest throughout his life
- **Charles Wesley** (1707-1788): Brother of John, wrote over 6,000 hymns that embedded Methodist theology in musical form
- **George Whitefield** (1714-1770): Powerful preacher who eventually led Calvinistic Methodists
- **Francis Asbury** (1745-1816): Primary leader of American Methodism who traveled over 300,000 miles on horseback
- **Thomas Coke** (1747-1814): First Methodist bishop who helped spread the movement globally
- **Susanna Wesley** (1669-1742): Mother of John and Charles who significantly influenced their spiritual development
- **Barbara Heck** (1734-1804) and Philip Embury (1729-1775): Lay founders of American Methodism

## Theological Distinctives

Methodist theology developed several characteristic emphases:

- **Arminianism**: Belief in universal atonement and human free will to accept or reject salvation
- **Prevenient grace**: God's grace works in all people before they're aware of it, enabling response to God
- **Assurance of salvation**: Personal experience of forgiveness and relationship with God
- **Sanctification**: Process of growth in holiness after conversion ("going on to perfection")
- **Christian perfection**: Wesley's controversial teaching about the possibility of perfect love toward God and neighbor
- **Quadrilateral**: Later formulation of Wesley's theological method using Scripture, tradition, reason, and experience
- **Social holiness**: Personal holiness necessarily expressed through community and social engagement

## Organizational Development

Methodism established distinctive structures:

- **Circuit riders**: Traveling preachers covering large territories on horseback
- **Connexional system**: Network of interdependent societies rather than independent congregations
- **Conference**: Annual gathering of preachers for accountability and assignment
- **Episcopal structure**: Adoption of bishops in American Methodism after the Revolution
