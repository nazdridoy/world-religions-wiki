Progressive Christianity is a modern religious movement characterized by a willingness to question tradition, acceptance of human diversity, emphasis on social justice, and environmental stewardship. It emerged in the late 20th century as a response to perceived fundamentalism and religious exclusivism, seeking to formulate a faith that engages contemporary issues while remaining rooted in Christian tradition and spirituality.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Influences
Progressive Christianity has roots in several preceding theological movements:
- **Liberal Theology**: 19th-century emphasis on reason, experience, and historical-critical approaches to scripture
- **Social Gospel Movement**: Early 20th-century focus on applying Christian ethics to social problems
- **Liberation Theology**: Latin American movement connecting faith with social justice and political liberation
- **Feminist Theology**: Critique of patriarchal elements in religious tradition and practice
- **Process Theology**: Understanding God as dynamic and responsive rather than static and unchanging

### Institutional Expressions
Progressive Christianity found expression through various organizations and networks:
- **The Center for Progressive Christianity** (founded 1996, now ProgressiveChristianity.org)
- **Progressive Christian Alliance** (founded 2008)
- **Progressive Christian Network Britain** (founded 2006)
- **The Convergence Movement** (founded 2014)
- **Wild Goose Festival** and other progressive Christian gatherings

### Prominent Voices
Key figures who have shaped progressive Christian thought include:

## Core Theological Characteristics

### Biblical Interpretation
Progressive Christianity approaches scripture through:

- Recognition of historical and cultural contexts of biblical texts
- Emphasis on Jesus's teachings and prophetic tradition over dogmatic readings
- Openness to insights from biblical scholarship and archaeology
- Focus on transformative narratives rather than propositional truth claims

### Christology
Progressive views of Jesus typically emphasize:
- Jesus as moral exemplar and prophet of social justice
- Metaphorical rather than physical understandings of resurrection
- Focus on Jesus's life and teachings rather than substitutionary atonement

- Seeing divinity in Jesus without necessarily affirming traditional trinitarian formulations

### Ethics and Social Issues
Progressive Christianity places strong emphasis on:
- **LGBTQ+ Inclusion**: Full affirmation of same-sex relationships and gender diversity
