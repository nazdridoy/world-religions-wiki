# Ecumenical Councils

![Ecumenical Council](../../images/ecumenical_council.jpg)

Ecumenical Councils are significant gatherings of bishops from throughout the Christian world that have established doctrine, addressed heresies, and guided Church practice across centuries. These authoritative assemblies have defined core Christian beliefs including the nature of Christ, the Trinity, and the relationship between divine and human natures. While various Christian traditions recognize different numbers of councils as truly "ecumenical," the first seven councils (325-787 CE) are generally acknowledged as foundational by Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and many Protestant churches.

## Purpose and Authority of Ecumenical Councils

Ecumenical Councils have historically served several crucial functions:

- **Doctrinal Definition**: Clarifying and defining Christian teachings in response to theological disputes
- **Condemnation of Heresies**: Identifying and rejecting teachings considered contrary to apostolic faith
- **Church Discipline**: Establishing canons (rules) for clergy and laity
- **Church Unity**: Fostering common understanding across diverse regional churches
- **Ecclesiastical Organization**: Addressing issues of church governance and jurisdiction

The authority of Ecumenical Councils stems from the belief that they represent the collective discernment of the Church guided by the Holy Spirit. Early councils drew precedent from the apostolic council described in Acts 15, where the apostles gathered in Jerusalem to resolve disputes about Gentile converts.

Different Christian traditions view the authority of these councils differently:
- **Eastern Orthodox**: View councils as infallible when received by the whole Church
- **Roman Catholic**: Consider councils infallible when confirmed by the Pope
- **Protestant**: Generally respect the first four or seven councils but subordinate their authority to Scripture

## The Seven Ecumenical Councils

### First Council of Nicaea (325 CE)
**Key Issues**: Arianism, the date of Easter
**Major Figures**: Emperor Constantine, Athanasius, Arius
**Key Outcomes**: 
- The Nicene Creed, establishing that Christ is "of one substance" (homoousios) with the Father
- Condemned Arianism, which taught that the Son was created and not co-eternal with the Father
- Established a uniform date for celebrating Easter

### First Council of Constantinople (381 CE)
**Key Issues**: Pneumatology (doctrine of the Holy Spirit), Apollinarianism
**Major Figures**: Emperor Theodosius I, Gregory of Nazianzus
**Key Outcomes**:
- Expanded Nicene Creed to affirm the divinity of the Holy Spirit
- Condemned Apollinarianism, which denied Christ had a human mind
- Ranked Constantinople as second in honor after Rome

### Council of Ephesus (431 CE)
**Key Issues**: Christology, Nestorianism
**Major Figures**: Cyril of Alexandria, Nestorius
**Key Outcomes**:
- Affirmed Mary as Theotokos ("God-bearer" or "Mother of God")
- Condemned Nestorianism, which overemphasized the distinction between Christ's human and divine natures
- Reaffirmed the Nicene Creed and forbade alterations

### Council of Chalcedon (451 CE)
**Key Issues**: Monophysitism, relationship between Christ's human and divine natures
**Major Figures**: Emperor Marcian, Pope Leo I
**Key Outcomes**:
- Defined Christ as one person in two natures (divine and human), "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation"
- Condemned Monophysitism, which taught Christ had only one nature
- Established the Chalcedonian Definition, a foundational document for Christian understanding of Christ
- This council led to the first major schism, with Oriental Orthodox churches (Coptic, Ethiopian, Armenian, Syrian) rejecting its conclusions

### Second Council of Constantinople (553 CE)
**Key Issues**: The "Three Chapters" controversy, Origenism
**Major Figures**: Emperor Justinian I, Pope Vigilius
**Key Outcomes**:
- Condemned writings of three theologians (Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyrus, and Ibas of Edessa) thought to support Nestorianism
- Anathematized certain teachings of Origen
- Attempted (unsuccessfully) to reconcile with non-Chalcedonian churches

### Third Council of Constantinople (680-681 CE)
**Key Issues**: Monothelitism
**Major Figures**: Emperor Constantine IV, Pope Agatho
**Key Outcomes**:
- Affirmed that Christ has two wills (divine and human), corresponding to his two natures
- Condemned Monothelitism, which taught Christ had only one will
- Anathematized several figures including Pope Honorius I, creating a precedent for papal fallibility

### Second Council of Nicaea (787 CE)
**Key Issues**: Iconoclasm
**Major Figures**: Empress Irene, Tarasius of Constantinople
**Key Outcomes**:
- Defended the veneration of icons while distinguishing it from worship
- Condemned iconoclasm (the destruction of religious images)
- Distinguished between veneration (proskynesis) and worship (latreia)
- Established theological basis for Christian visual art

## Later Councils

After the Great Schism of 1054 that divided Eastern and Western Christianity, subsequent councils are viewed differently by various traditions:

**Roman Catholic Church** recognizes 21 Ecumenical Councils, adding:
- Four Lateran Councils (1123, 1139, 1179, 1215)
- Two Councils of Lyon (1245, 1274)
- Councils of Vienne (1311-1312), Constance (1414-1418), Basel/Florence (1431-1445)
- Five Lateran Council (1512-1517)
- Council of Trent (1545-1563)
- First Vatican Council (1869-1870)
- Second Vatican Council (1962-1965)

**Eastern Orthodox Churches** generally recognize only the first seven councils as fully ecumenical, though some consider the Council of Constantinople in 879-880 (which rejected the filioque clause) and the Palamite Councils of the 14th century as ecumenical.

**Oriental Orthodox Churches** (Coptic, Ethiopian, Armenian, Syrian) accept only the first three councils.

**Church of the East** (sometimes incorrectly called "Nestorian") accepts only the first two councils.

**Protestant churches** vary in their reception of councils, generally respecting the first four or seven but not regarding them as infallible.

## Historical Significance

The theological definitions established by the Ecumenical Councils laid the doctrinal foundations for Christianity, producing:

1. **Trinitarian Theology**: Articulation of God as three persons in one essence
2. **Christology**: Understanding of the incarnation and the relationship between Christ's humanity and divinity
3. **Creedal Statements**: The Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, used in liturgies worldwide
4. **Theological Language**: Technical terms that continue to shape Christian discourse
5. **Canon Law**: Church regulations that influenced both religious and civil law

Additionally, the councils demonstrate the early internationalization of Christianity, as bishops from diverse cultures and regions worked together to articulate common beliefs despite profound linguistic, cultural, and political differences.

## Modern Ecumenical Movement

In the 20th century, the term "ecumenical" took on new meaning in the context of efforts to restore unity among divided Christian churches. The World Council of Churches, established in 1948, seeks to foster cooperation among Protestant, Orthodox, and other Christian bodies (though the Roman Catholic Church is not a member).

Modern ecumenical dialogues often revisit the ancient councils, seeking common ground in the fundamental Christological and Trinitarian definitions while acknowledging that historical, cultural, and linguistic factors may have contributed to misunderstandings and divisions.
