# African Christianity

African Christianity represents one of the most dynamic expressions of the Christian faith globally. From ancient North African roots that produced influential theologians like Augustine of Hippo to the explosive growth of indigenous churches in the 20th and 21st centuries, Christianity in Africa has been characterized by remarkable diversity, vibrancy, and theological creativity. Once considered a Western import associated with colonialism, Christianity has been thoroughly Africanized, with the continent now home to over 685 million Christiansâ€”nearly a quarter of the world's Christian population. This transformation has made Africa a center of gravity for global Christianity, with its distinctive theological perspectives, worship styles, and church structures increasingly influencing Christian expression worldwide.
