The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 triggered one of the most significant religious revivals of the 20th century. After decades of state-sponsored atheism, official persecution, and underground religious activity, Christianity experienced a dramatic resurgence across the former Soviet republics. This period of religious renewal has been characterized by complex dynamics of institutional restoration, identity formation, political engagement, and theological development as churches navigate the legacies of communism and the challenges of post-Soviet societies.

## Historical Background

### Soviet Religious Policy
Religious life under Soviet rule varied by period and region but consistently faced restrictions:

- **Militant Atheism (1917-1939)**: Initial Bolshevik persecution including church property confiscation, clergy executions, and anti-religious propaganda

- **Khrushchev's Renewed Persecution (1958-1964)**: Intensified anti-religious campaign closing thousands of churches
- **Late Soviet Period (1964-1985)**: Bureaucratic control through religious affairs councils and infiltration by security services
- **Perestroika Liberalization (1985-1991)**: Gorbachev's reforms allowing gradual religious opening, culminating in the 1988 millennial celebration of Russia's baptism
