The Charismatic Renewal refers to a spiritual movement that emerged in the 1960s, characterized by an emphasis on the gifts of the Holy Spirit, expressive worship, personal religious experience, and supernatural manifestations such as speaking in tongues, prophecy, and healing. Unlike classical Pentecostalism, which formed new denominations, the Charismatic Renewal primarily occurred within established mainline Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox denominations, bringing Pentecostal spirituality to churches that had historically not emphasized these experiences.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early Growth
The Charismatic Renewal began unexpectedly in established denominations:

- **Episcopal Beginnings**: Generally traced to April 3, 1960, when Father Dennis Bennett, an Episcopal priest at St. Mark's Church in Van Nuys, California, announced to his congregation that he had received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and spoken in tongues
- **Early Spread**: Similar experiences soon reported in Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, and other mainline denominations throughout the 1960s
- **Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship**: Key organization in introducing charismatic spirituality to laypeople across denominational lines
- **University Outreach**: Significant early growth on college campuses
- **"Latter Rain" Influence**: Drew upon theological ideas from the post-WWII Latter Rain revival
