# The Apostolic Age

![Early Apostles](../../images/apostolic_age.jpg)

The Apostolic Age refers to the period immediately following Jesus's death and resurrection, approximately 30-100 CE, when the original apostles established the foundation of the Christian church. This formative period was characterized by the apostles' leadership, eyewitness testimony about Jesus, and the expansion of the early Christian movement from Jerusalem throughout the Mediterranean world.

## The Original Apostles

The term "apostle" comes from the Greek word "apostolos," meaning "one who is sent." Jesus appointed twelve apostles during his ministry to be his closest disciples and representatives:

- Simon Peter
- Andrew
- James (son of Zebedee)
- John
- Philip
- Bartholomew (Nathanael)
- Thomas
- Matthew (Levi)
- James (son of Alphaeus)
- Thaddaeus (Judas, son of James)
- Simon the Zealot
- Judas Iscariot (later replaced by Matthias)

Paul of Tarsus, though not among the original twelve, claimed apostleship based on his direct encounter with the risen Christ and became one of the most influential apostles in spreading Christianity to Gentiles.

## Pentecost and the Early Jerusalem Church

The book of Acts describes the Apostolic Age beginning with Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit descended upon the gathered disciples in Jerusalem. This event, occurring 50 days after Jesus's resurrection, empowered the apostles to preach boldly about Jesus as the risen Messiah.

Under the leadership of Peter and others, the Jerusalem church grew rapidly. According to Acts, they devoted themselves to:
- The apostles' teaching
- Fellowship
- Breaking of bread (communion)
- Prayer

The Jerusalem church maintained Jewish practices while affirming Jesus as the Messiah. They shared possessions communally, worshiped in the Temple, and broke bread together in homes.

## Persecution and Expansion

Early Christians soon faced persecution from Jewish authorities who viewed their teachings as blasphemous. Stephen, one of the first appointed deacons, became the first Christian martyr when he was stoned to death. This persecution scattered believers beyond Jerusalem into Judea and Samaria, inadvertently helping spread Christianity.

Philip brought Christianity to Samaria and baptized an Ethiopian official, marking early cross-cultural evangelism. Peter's vision and subsequent baptism of the Roman centurion Cornelius established the precedent for including Gentiles in the church without requiring them to follow Jewish law.

## Paul's Missions and Gentile Christianity

Paul (formerly Saul), after his conversion experience on the road to Damascus, became the foremost apostle to the Gentiles. His missionary journeys established churches throughout Asia Minor (modern Turkey), Greece, and eventually Rome. His theology emphasized:

- Salvation by faith, not works of the law
- The inclusion of Gentiles without the requirements of Jewish law
- The church as the body of Christ, transcending ethnic divisions

Paul's letters to these early churches, addressing doctrinal and practical issues, became foundational texts of the New Testament.

## The Jerusalem Council

Around 49 CE, church leaders gathered in Jerusalem to address the question of whether Gentile converts needed to follow Jewish laws, particularly circumcision. As recorded in Acts 15, this council, involving Peter, James (Jesus's brother, who led the Jerusalem church), and Paul, determined that Gentile Christians would not be required to follow most Jewish laws, though they should abstain from certain practices that would especially offend Jewish sensibilities.

This decision was pivotal in establishing Christianity as distinct from Judaism and facilitated its spread among non-Jewish populations.

## Leadership After the Original Apostles

As the apostles aged, church leadership gradually transitioned to a new generation of bishops and elders. Tradition holds that most of the apostles were martyred for their faith, with John possibly being the only exception, living into old age on the island of Patmos.

Church fathers like Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, and Polycarp of Smyrna—who had direct or indirect connections to the apostles—became important leaders in the late first and early second centuries, providing continuity with apostolic teaching.

## Legacy and Theological Significance

The Apostolic Age established key elements that would define Christianity:

- The core narrative of Jesus's life, death, and resurrection
- The concept of the church as a distinct community of believers
- Initial theological formulations about Jesus's identity and relationship with God
- The structure of church leadership
- The beginnings of Christian scripture, including the letters of Paul and the early Gospels

Christians traditionally view this period as having special authority because of the apostles' direct connection to Jesus, making their teachings and writings foundational for Christian doctrine and practice.
