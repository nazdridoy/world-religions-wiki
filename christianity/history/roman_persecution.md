# Roman Persecution of Christians

![Christian Martyrdom](../../images/roman_persecution.jpg)

For nearly three centuries after Christianity's emergence, followers of Jesus periodically faced persecution from Roman authorities. While often exaggerated in later Christian accounts, these persecutions significantly shaped Christian identity, theology, and practice. Roman persecution of Christians varied widely in intensity, scope, and motivation across different periods and regions of the Empire.

## Causes of Roman Persecution

Several factors contributed to Roman hostility toward Christians:

- **Religious concerns**: Romans viewed Christians as atheists for rejecting the traditional gods and refusing to participate in state cults. This was seen as endangering Rome's relationship with its deities.

- **Political suspicion**: Christian refusal to offer sacrifices to the emperor (viewed as treason) and their allegiance to a "kingdom not of this world" raised concerns about their loyalty.

- **Social disruption**: Christianity challenged social hierarchies, appeared secretive with their private meetings, and sometimes divided families when members converted.

- **Cultural prejudice**: Christians were often viewed as part of a foreign, potentially subversive superstition from the troublesome province of Judea.

- **Economic factors**: Occupational groups whose livelihoods were connected to traditional religious practices (like idol craftsmen in Ephesus, Acts 19) sometimes opposed Christian growth.

Legal grounds for persecution typically involved charges of atheism, sedition, or practicing an unauthorized religion (religio illicita).

## Phases of Persecution

Christian persecution under Rome evolved through several distinct phases:

### Early Persecution (64-100 CE)

- **Neronian Persecution (64 CE)**: The first documented state persecution occurred when Emperor Nero blamed Christians for the Great Fire of Rome. According to the Roman historian Tacitus, Christians were covered in animal skins and torn by dogs, crucified, or burned as human torches.

- **Domitian's Reign (81-96 CE)**: Traditional accounts suggest Domitian persecuted Christians for refusing emperor worship, though modern historians debate the extent of this persecution.

During this period, persecution was largely localized and sporadic rather than empire-wide.

### Second Century Persecution (100-193 CE)

- **Trajan's Policy**: In correspondence with Pliny the Younger (c. 112 CE), Emperor Trajan established a policy that Christians should not be actively sought out but could be punished if accused and unwilling to recant.

- **Martyrdom of Polycarp**: Around 155 CE, the elderly bishop Polycarp was burned at the stake in Smyrna, demonstrating persecution of high-profile Christian leaders.

- **Marcus Aurelius's Reign**: Under the philosopher-emperor (161-180 CE), significant persecutions occurred in cities like Lyon and Vienne in Gaul, described in vivid detail by church historian Eusebius.

This period was characterized by periodic, localized persecutions rather than systematic empire-wide efforts.

### Systematic Persecutions (235-313 CE)

- **Decius (249-251 CE)**: Initiated the first truly empire-wide persecution, requiring all citizens to perform a sacrifice to Roman gods and obtain a certificate (libellus) proving their compliance. Many Christians were executed for refusing, while others apostatized or obtained certificates fraudulently.

- **Valerian (253-260 CE)**: Specifically targeted Christian leaders and the educated Christian elite, confiscating property and executing bishops, including Pope Sixtus II.

- **The Great Persecution** under Diocletian and Galerius (303-311 CE): The most severe and systematic persecution, involving:
  - Destruction of churches and scriptures
  - Removal of Christians from public office
  - Imprisonment of clergy
  - Requirements for sacrifice to Roman gods
  - Torture and execution of those who refused compliance

The persecution ended with the Edict of Milan in 313 CE, which established religious tolerance under Constantine.

## Christian Responses to Persecution

Christians developed various responses to persecution:

- **Martyrdom**: Some Christians willingly faced execution, viewing it as the ultimate witness (the Greek word "martyr" means "witness"). Accounts of martyrs' trials and deaths circulated widely, inspiring others.

- **Flight**: Following Jesus's instruction to "flee to another town" when persecuted (Matthew 10:23), many Christians relocated to avoid arrest.

- **Accommodation**: Some Christians found ways to compromise, such as allowing family members to make sacrifices on their behalf or bribing officials for certificates of compliance.

- **Apostasy**: Under extreme pressure, some Christians renounced their faith, creating later controversies about whether and how they could be readmitted to the church.

- **Apologetics**: Christian writers like Justin Martyr and Tertullian composed defenses of Christianity aimed at Roman officials, attempting to demonstrate that Christians were not a threat to society.

## Regional Variations

The intensity of persecution varied significantly by region:

- North Africa saw particularly intense persecution and developed strict approaches to dealing with those who lapsed.

- Asia Minor (modern Turkey) experienced various persecutions from the time of Pliny the Younger.

- Rome itself witnessed the martyrdom of several prominent Christians, including Peter and Paul (according to tradition).

- Gaul (modern France) experienced severe but localized persecution, especially under Marcus Aurelius.

- Alexandria became a center of persecution under Decius and Diocletian.

The eastern regions of the Empire generally experienced more severe persecution than western regions.

## Impact on Christian Development

Persecution profoundly shaped early Christianity in several ways:

- **Theology of suffering**: Christians developed a theology that gave meaning to persecution, viewing it as participation in Christ's suffering.

- **Church organization**: The need to determine who had authority to readmit those who had lapsed under persecution helped formalize church hierarchies and procedures.

- **Cult of martyrs**: Veneration of martyrs became an important aspect of Christian devotion, with martyrs' death days commemorated and their remains venerated.

- **Literature**: Accounts of martyrdom (acta martyrum) became an important literary genre that shaped Christian self-understanding.

- **Church-state relations**: Early experiences of persecution influenced later Christian thinking about the relationship between church and political authority.

## Historical Reality vs. Later Accounts

Modern historical scholarship has sometimes questioned traditional narratives about Roman persecution:

- The total number of martyrs was likely much smaller than suggested by later Christian accounts.

- Persecution was rarely empire-wide before the mid-third century.

- Some accounts of martyrdom were embellished or created centuries after the events.

- Romans generally persecuted Christians for specific legal or political reasons rather than simply because of their beliefs.

Nevertheless, the historical reality of persecution and its profound impact on early Christianity is well-established.
