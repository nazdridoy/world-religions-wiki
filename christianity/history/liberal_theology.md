Liberal theology emerged in the 19th century as a movement seeking to reinterpret Christianity in light of Enlightenment principles, modern scientific discoveries, and changing social conditions. It sought to adapt traditional Christian doctrines to contemporary intellectual developments, emphasizing reason, experience, ethical dimensions of faith, and the historical-critical interpretation of scripture. Liberal theology represented a significant departure from orthodox approaches to Christianity and generated influential new understandings of God, Christ, the Bible, and the Christian life that continue to shape modern religious thought.

## Historical Origins

Liberal theology developed from several intellectual currents:

- **Enlightenment rationalism**: Application of reason and scientific principles to religious questions
- **German idealism**: Philosophical frameworks from Kant, Hegel, and Schleiermacher 
- **Biblical criticism**: Historical-critical methods of scriptural interpretation (Wellhausen, Strauss)
- **Romanticism**: Emphasis on religious feeling, experience, and intuition
- **Scientific advances**: Responses to Darwinian evolution and geological discoveries
- **Social reform movements**: Abolition, women's rights, industrial reform
- **Academic theology**: Development within university settings rather than ecclesiastical contexts

## Key Figures and Their Contributions
