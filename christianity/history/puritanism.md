# Puritanism

![Puritanism](../../images/puritanism.jpg)

Puritanism was a significant religious reform movement that emerged within the Church of England in the late 16th century and flourished particularly in the 17th century. Characterized by a desire to "purify" the church of Roman Catholic influences and practices, Puritans sought a more thorough reformation of church doctrine, worship, and governance. Their commitment to scriptural authority, moral rigor, educational advancement, and spiritual fervor profoundly shaped both English society and early American colonial life. Although Puritanism as a distinct movement eventually declined, its cultural and religious legacy continues to influence Protestant Christianity, political thought, and social values, particularly in the Anglo-American world.

## Origins and Development

Puritanism emerged from specific historical circumstances:

- **English Reformation context**: Dissatisfaction with the compromises of the Elizabethan Settlement
- **Continental Reformed influence**: Inspiration from Calvinist theology in Geneva, Zurich, and the Netherlands
- **Vestiarian Controversy** (1560s): Early conflict over clerical vestments symbolizing deeper theological concerns
- **Admonition to Parliament** (1572): Articulation of Puritan grievances and vision for church reform
- **Hampton Court Conference** (1604): Failed attempt at compromise under James I
- **Great Migration** (1630s): Establishment of Puritan colonies in New England
- **English Civil War** (1642-1651): Brief period of Puritan political dominance under Cromwell

## Core Theological Beliefs

Puritans held distinctive theological positions:

- **Calvinism**: Emphasis on divine sovereignty, predestination, and unconditional election
- **Covenant theology**: Understanding of salvation history through divine covenants
- **Total depravity**: Recognition of humanity's complete moral corruption through original sin
- **Scripture primacy**: Bible as sole authority for faith and practice (sola scriptura)
- **Sanctification**: Emphasis on progressive growth in holiness after conversion
- **Providence**: God's active involvement in all human affairs and natural events
- **Sabbatarianism**: Strict observance of Sunday as day of worship and rest

## Puritan Worship and Practice

Puritan religious life emphasized certain elements:

- **Plain style**: Simple, unadorned worship spaces and services
- **Sermon centrality**: Extensive biblical exposition as heart of worship
- **Congregational singing**: Metrical psalms rather than elaborate choral music
- **Prayer**: Extemporaneous rather than liturgical forms

## Church Organization

Puritans advocated for particular church structures:

- **Congregationalism**: Local church autonomy (in New England)

- **Synods and associations**: Voluntary cooperation between independent congregations

## Social and Cultural Impact

Puritanism profoundly influenced society:
