Evangelicalism is a major transdenominational movement within Protestant Christianity that emerged in the 18th century and has become one of the most influential forms of Christianity worldwide. Characterized by an emphasis on personal conversion, biblical authority, the centrality of the cross, and active evangelism, evangelical Christianity has shaped religious, cultural, and political landscapes across the globe while evolving into diverse expressions.

## Historical Development

### Origins in Revival Movements
Evangelicalism emerged from the spiritual revival movements of the 18th century, particularly:

- **The Great Awakening** (1730s-1740s): Led by preachers like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield in British North America, emphasizing emotional conversion experiences and personal relationship with God
- **The Methodist Revival**: John Wesley's movement in England, combining emotional religious experience with methodical spiritual discipline
- **Pietism**: German movements emphasizing personal devotion, Bible study, and practical holiness

These movements represented reactions against both the perceived spiritual deadness of established churches and the rationalism of the Enlightenment, emphasizing instead the "religion of the heart."

### 19th Century Growth
During the 19th century, evangelicalism expanded through:

- **The Second Great Awakening** (1790s-1840s): Mass revival meetings and conversion experiences that reshaped American religion
- **Missionary movements**: The dramatic growth of foreign missions, mobilizing thousands to spread Christianity globally
- **Social reform**: Evangelical involvement in abolition, temperance, and other reform movements
- **Denominational growth**: The rapid expansion of Methodist, Baptist, and other evangelical denominations
- **Bible and tract societies**: Mass distribution of religious literature

### 20th Century Developments
The 20th century saw several significant developments:

- **Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy**: Early 20th century conflicts over biblical interpretation and theology led to division between conservative evangelicals and liberal Protestants
- **Neo-evangelical movement**: Led by figures like Billy Graham and Carl F.H. Henry, who sought to maintain doctrinal conservatism while engaging more constructively with broader society
- **Charismatic renewal**: The integration of Pentecostal emphases on spiritual gifts into mainstream evangelicalism
- **Political mobilization**: Especially in the United States, where evangelicals became a significant voting bloc starting in the 1970s
- **Global expansion**: The dramatic growth of evangelical Christianity in Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia

## Core Theological Characteristics

Historian David Bebbington identified four characteristics (the "Bebbington Quadrilateral") that have defined evangelicalism across its various expressions:

### Conversionism
The belief that lives need to be transformed through a "born-again" experience. Evangelicals emphasize:
- Personal decision to follow Christ
- Conversion as a discernible moment or process
- Testimony of personal transformation

### Biblicism
A high regard for the Bible as the ultimate authority for faith and practice:
- Emphasis on Bible reading and study
- Scripture as inspired and authoritative
- Biblical preaching as central to worship

### Crucicentrism
Focus on Christ's sacrifice on the cross as the heart of the Christian message:
- Atonement theology emphasizing Jesus' death for human sins
- The cross as the central Christian symbol
- Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's work

### Activism
The expression of the gospel through effort, particularly in evangelism and mission:
- Personal witnessing to non-believers
- Support for missionary enterprises
- Active service and good works as evidence of faith

## Major Evangelical Traditions
