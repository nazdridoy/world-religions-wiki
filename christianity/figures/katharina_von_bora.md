# Katharina von Bora - Former Nun and Protestant Role Model

![Katharina von Bora](katharina_von_bora.jpg)

Katharina von Bora (1499-1552) was a former Cistercian nun who became the wife of German reformer Martin Luther, establishing with him the prototype of the Protestant clergy family. Her escape from the convent, subsequent marriage to Luther in 1525, and her capable management of their household affairs—including operating a farm, brewery, and boarding house—challenged medieval ideals of celibate religious life while creating a new model of Christian vocation through marriage and family. Though often overshadowed by her famous husband, von Bora's practical skills, strong character, and unflinching partnership with Luther during the tumultuous Reformation era made her an influential figure in her own right. Her life embodied the Reformation principle of vocation within ordinary life and demonstrated how women could serve God outside conventional religious institutions.
