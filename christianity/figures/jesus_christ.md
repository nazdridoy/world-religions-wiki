Jesus Christ (c. 4 BCE - c. 30-33 CE) is the central figure of Christianity, believed by Christians to be the incarnate Son of God, the long-awaited Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament, and the savior of humanity. His life, teachings, death, and resurrection form the foundation of Christian faith and practice worldwide.

## Historical Context

Born in Bethlehem during the reign of Herod the Great, Jesus grew up in Nazareth, a small town in Galilee. He lived during a time of Roman occupation of Judea and significant religious expectation among the Jewish population for the coming of the Messiah who would restore Israel.

The primary sources for information about Jesus's life are the four canonical Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), though he is also mentioned in some non-Christian sources from the period. Historians generally accept that Jesus was a historical figure who was baptized by John the Baptist and crucified by order of the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate.

## Ministry and Teachings

Around the age of 30, Jesus began a public ministry that lasted approximately three years. Key elements include:

- **Proclamation of the Kingdom of God**: Jesus's central message focused on the coming of God's kingdom or reign.
- **Teaching through Parables**: He often taught using parablesâ€”simple stories with deeper spiritual meanings.
- **The Sermon on the Mount**: Containing teachings like the Beatitudes, the Lord's Prayer, and ethical instructions.
- **Miraculous Works**: The Gospels report numerous miracles, including healings, exorcisms, controlling nature, and raising the dead.
- **Challenging Religious Authorities**: Jesus often critiqued religious leaders of his day for hypocrisy and legalism.
- **Inclusive Fellowship**: He associated with those considered outcasts in his society, including tax collectors, sinners, women, and the sick.

## Death and Resurrection

According to Christian tradition, Jesus was arrested in Jerusalem after the Last Supper with his disciples. After trials before the Jewish Sanhedrin and the Roman authority, he was sentenced to death by crucifixion. Christians believe that:

1. Jesus died on the cross, taking upon himself the sins of humanity
2. He was buried in a tomb provided by Joseph of Arimathea
3. On the third day (Sunday), he rose from the dead
4. He appeared to his disciples over a period of 40 days
5. He ascended into heaven with a promise to return

The resurrection is considered the central, definitive event of Christian faith, interpreted as confirmation of Jesus's divine identity and victory over sin and death.

## Theological Significance

Christianity teaches that Jesus is:

- **Fully Divine and Fully Human**: Possessing two complete natures united in one person (the hypostatic union).
- **The Second Person of the Trinity**: One of three persons who share the same divine essence.
- **The Word Made Flesh**: The divine Logos who took on human form.
- **Savior and Redeemer**: Through his sacrificial death, he atoned for humanity's sins.
- **Lord and King**: Who will return to establish God's kingdom fully.

Different Christian traditions emphasize various aspects of Jesus's identity and work, but all center on him as the foundation of their faith.

## Cultural Impact

Beyond religious significance, Jesus has profoundly influenced world history and culture:

- **Art and Literature**: Inspiring countless works from medieval cathedrals to modern fiction
- **Ethics and Philosophy**: Shaping Western moral thought through teachings like the Golden Rule
- **Calendar**: The Western calendar system divides history into BC/AD (or BCE/CE) based on his birth
- **Social Movements**: Inspiring reform movements throughout history, from abolition to civil rights
- **Language and Idioms**: Contributing numerous phrases and references to world languages
