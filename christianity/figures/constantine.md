# Constantine the Great (c. 272-337 CE)

![Constantine the Great](../images/figures/constantine.jpg)

Constantine I, also known as Constantine the Great, was the Roman Emperor whose conversion to Christianity and subsequent policies transformed the religion from a persecuted minority faith to a state-supported institution. His reign marked one of the most pivotal turning points in Christian history, as he ended systematic persecution, convened the first ecumenical council, and provided imperial resources for church expansion. While historical assessments of Constantine vary widely, his impact on Christianity's development from marginalized sect to dominant cultural force is undeniable.

## Rise to Power

Constantine's path to imperial authority unfolded during one of Rome's most turbulent periods:

### Background and Early Career

- Born around 272 CE in Naissus (modern Niš, Serbia) to Constantius Chlorus, an officer in the Roman army
- Raised in the eastern provinces, particularly at the court of Emperor Diocletian
- Served with distinction in military campaigns in Egypt and Persia
- Witnessed Diocletian's Great Persecution of Christians (303-311), which targeted church buildings, scriptures, and clergy

### Civil War and Consolidation

The collapse of Diocletian's tetrarchy (system of four co-emperors) led to a series of civil wars:

- 306 CE: Proclaimed emperor by troops after his father's death in York, Britain
- 312 CE: Defeated rival Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, securing control of the Western Empire
- 324 CE: Defeated Eastern Emperor Licinius, becoming sole ruler of the unified Roman Empire
- Established Constantinople (formerly Byzantium) as his new capital in 330 CE

## Conversion to Christianity

The nature and timing of Constantine's conversion remains one of history's most debated religious transformations:

### The Milvian Bridge Vision

According to contemporary sources, before the decisive battle against Maxentius in 312:

- Eusebius of Caesarea records that Constantine saw a cross of light in the sky and the words "In this sign, conquer" (Latin: *In hoc signo vinces*)
- Lactantius reports that Constantine was instructed in a dream to place the Chi-Rho symbol (☧, the first two letters of Christ's name in Greek) on his soldiers' shields
- Following his victory, Constantine attributed his success to the Christian God

### Gradual Transformation

Constantine's embrace of Christianity appears to have been progressive rather than instantaneous:

- Initially maintained traditional Roman religious practices alongside Christian patronage
- Did not receive baptism until his deathbed in 337 CE (a common practice in early Christianity)
- Retained the imperial title *Pontifex Maximus* (chief priest of the Roman state religion)
- Continued to appear on coins with sol invictus (the unconquered sun) imagery for years after his conversion

## Religious Policies

Constantine's governance marked a revolutionary shift in Christianity's relationship with the Roman state:

### Toleration and Privilege

- 313 CE: Issued the Edict of Milan with co-emperor Licinius, granting religious freedom throughout the empire and ordering the restoration of confiscated Christian property
- Exempted Christian clergy from public service obligations and certain taxes
- Recognized the legal right of churches to own property
- Financially supported church building programs throughout the empire
- Encouraged but did not mandate conversion to Christianity

### Church Building Program

Constantine initiated an unprecedented program of church construction:

- Commissioned magnificent basilicas in Rome, including the original St. Peter's Basilica over the apostle's traditional burial site, and the Lateran Basilica
- Sponsored churches in Jerusalem, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at the site identified as Christ's tomb
- Built churches in Constantinople, his new capital
- Established a distinctive architectural style that would influence Christian sacred spaces for centuries

### Legal and Social Reforms

Constantine's legislation increasingly reflected Christian moral principles:

- Forbade the practice of crucifixion
- Limited the use of torture and improved prison conditions
- Prohibited the separation of enslaved families during estate divisions
- Protected children from exploitation and abandonment
- Restricted gladiatorial combat
- Proclaimed Sunday as a day of rest (though not explicitly as a Christian sabbath)

## Involvement in Church Affairs

Constantine took an active role in ecclesiastical matters despite not being baptized for most of his reign:

### The Donatist Controversy

- Intervened in the North African schism between Catholics and Donatists (who rejected clergy who had surrendered scriptures during persecution)
- Initially supported the Catholic position against the Donatists
- Convened the Council of Arles (314 CE) to address the controversy
- Later adopted a more conciliatory approach when condemnation failed to restore unity

### The Council of Nicaea (325 CE)

Constantine's most significant ecclesiastical action was convening the first ecumenical (worldwide) council:

- Called bishops from across the empire to resolve the Arian controversy regarding Christ's nature and relationship to God
- Personally attended sessions and encouraged consensus
- Endorsed the council's formulation of the Nicene Creed, which affirmed Christ's full divinity ("of one substance with the Father")
- Exiled Arius and certain bishops who refused to accept the council's decisions
- Set precedent for imperial involvement in doctrinal matters

### Holy Land Developments

Constantine took special interest in Christianity's birthplace:

- Sponsored his mother Helena's pilgrimage to Palestine
- Supported Helena's identification and monumentalization of sites associated with Jesus's life
- Ordered the destruction of a temple to Venus in Jerusalem to uncover what was believed to be Christ's tomb
- Commissioned the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem

## Historical Assessment

Constantine's legacy has been interpreted in radically different ways throughout history:

### Contemporary Praise

Early Christian writers like Eusebius portrayed Constantine in glowing terms:
- As a new Moses leading God's people to freedom
- As the fulfillment of biblical prophecy
- As God's chosen instrument for Christianity's triumph

### Medieval Veneration

- Eastern Orthodox tradition canonized Constantine as a saint
- Byzantine emperors claimed to rule in his tradition
- The forged "Donation of Constantine" document was used to legitimize papal authority in the West

### Modern Critical Perspectives

Contemporary historians have offered more nuanced assessments:
- **Political Pragmatism**: Some view his religious policies as primarily motivated by desire to unify the empire under a single faith
- **Syncretic Religion**: Evidence suggests Constantine maintained elements of solar monotheism alongside Christianity
- **Incomplete Conversion**: His delayed baptism and continued use of pagan symbolism raise questions about his personal faith
- **Church-State Boundaries**: His precedent of imperial involvement in ecclesiastical affairs had problematic long-term consequences

## Cultural and Religious Impact

Constantine's reign fundamentally altered Christianity's trajectory:

### Institutional Transformation

- Shifted Christianity from a marginalized, sometimes illegal movement to an imperially favored institution
- Accelerated the church's development of formal hierarchical structures parallel to imperial administration
- Created conditions where Christianity could eventually become the empire's official religion under Theodosius I (380 CE)

### Theological Development

- Imperial patronage enabled larger, more formal theological discussions
- The Nicene formulation established orthodox trinitarian theology
- Church's newfound security allowed greater focus on doctrinal precision rather than mere survival

### Practical Consequences

- Christian population grew dramatically as conversion became advantageous rather than dangerous
- Nominal adherence became more common as social pressure to convert increased
- Church gained significant wealth and property, changing its socioeconomic position
- Establishment of "Christendom" – the fusion of Christian and Roman imperial culture

## Artistic and Symbolic Representation

Constantine's image has been portrayed extensively throughout history:

- Colossal statue once stood in the Roman Forum (fragments remain in Rome's Capitoline Museums)
- Famous colossus head in Rome depicts him with idealized, divine attributes
- Medieval and Byzantine art often showed him alongside his mother Helena or with the True Cross
- Renaissance and Baroque paintings frequently depicted his vision and conversion
- The Arch of Constantine in Rome, dedicated in 315 CE, combines imagery from earlier monuments with new scenes
