# Vladimir of Kiev - Baptizer of Rus'

![Vladimir of Kiev](vladimir_kiev.jpg)

St. Vladimir (c. 958-1015), Grand Prince of Kiev, transformed the religious and cultural landscape of Eastern Europe when he converted to Orthodox Christianity and initiated the mass baptism of his people in 988. His decision to adopt Byzantine Christianity over other religious options established Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus as Orthodox Christian nations and aligned the East Slavic world with Byzantine civilization rather than Western European culture. Though initially known for his brutal pagan rule, Vladimir's conversion led to a remarkable personal transformation and extensive social reforms. His legacy as the "Equal-to-the-Apostles" continues to shape Eastern Slavic identity, religious practice, and cultural orientation to the present day.

## Early Life and Rise to Power

Vladimir was born to Prince Sviatoslav I of Kiev and his housekeeper Malusha, likely of Slavic origin. His illegitimate birth initially placed him at a disadvantage in succession matters.

When Sviatoslav divided his realm among his sons before his death in 972, Vladimir received Novgorod, while his half-brothers Yaropolk and Oleg received Kiev and the Drevlian lands respectively. After Sviatoslav's death, conflict erupted between the brothers:

- Yaropolk defeated and killed Oleg
- Vladimir fled to Scandinavia, fearing he would be next
- In 978, Vladimir returned with Viking mercenaries
- He conquered Novgorod, then Polotsk (where he forced the ruler's daughter Rogneda to marry him)
- Finally, he captured Kiev through treachery, having Yaropolk murdered

Vladimir's rise to power was marked by violence and pagan practices. Early chronicles describe him as:
- Establishing pagan idols throughout Kiev
- Practicing polygamy (with multiple wives and concubines)
- Conducting human sacrifices to pagan gods
- Engaging in aggressive military campaigns against neighboring peoples

## Religious Quest and Conversion

The most pivotal moment in Vladimir's reign—and in the history of Eastern Slavic civilization—was his religious conversion. According to the Primary Chronicle (a medieval Slavic historical text), Vladimir undertook a careful evaluation of various religious options available to his people:

### The Religious Envoys

Vladimir reportedly sent envoys to study the major religions of neighboring civilizations:
- Islam (as practiced by Volga Bulgars)
- Judaism (as practiced by the Khazars)
- Western Christianity (as practiced by Germans)
- Eastern Christianity (as practiced in Constantinople)

The envoys returned with accounts of each religion. The report about the Byzantine Divine Liturgy at Hagia Sophia proved decisive: "We knew not whether we were in heaven or on earth, for on earth there is no such splendor or such beauty, and we are at a loss to describe it."

### Political Considerations

Vladimir's religious choice was not purely spiritual but also political:
- Alliance with Byzantium offered significant advantages
- Marriage to a Byzantine princess would elevate his status
- Byzantine cultural influence would strengthen his state
- The Byzantine model offered a framework for integrating church and state

### The Conversion

In 988, Vladimir captured the Byzantine city of Cherson (in Crimea) and negotiated with Emperor Basil II:
- Vladimir would provide military aid to Basil against rebels
- In return, he would marry Basil's sister Anna
- The condition was that Vladimir must convert to Christianity

Vladimir agreed and was baptized in Cherson. He then returned to Kiev with Byzantine clergy, his new wife, and religious artifacts (including icons and relics).

## Baptism of Rus'

Upon returning to Kiev, Vladimir ordered the destruction of pagan idols. The wooden statue of the chief god Perun was dragged through the streets, beaten with sticks, and thrown into the Dnieper River.

Vladimir then issued a proclamation that all citizens of Kiev should appear at the Dnieper for baptism. The Primary Chronicle records:

"Then Vladimir sent heralds throughout the whole city, saying, 'If anyone does not come to the river tomorrow, whether rich or poor, beggar or slave, that one shall be my enemy.' When the people heard these words, they went with joy... They came to the water and went into it... some up to their necks, others up to their breasts... priests stood performing the ceremony."

This mass baptism in the Dnieper River in 988 is considered the foundational moment of Russian Orthodoxy and is commemorated as the "Baptism of Rus'."

## Transformation of Kievan Society

Vladimir's conversion initiated profound changes in Kievan society:

### Personal Transformation

The once-brutal ruler underwent a remarkable personal change:
- He dismissed his multiple wives and concubines (though maintained his marriage to Anna)
- He established a system of state welfare for the poor
- He became known for his mercy, even hesitating to execute criminals
- He hosted regular feasts for his subjects

### Religious and Cultural Changes

Vladimir systematically transformed Kievan society:
- Built the Church of the Tithes (Desiatynna Church) in Kiev
- Established schools for the children of nobles to learn literacy
- Brought Byzantine architects, artists, and clergy to Kiev
- Introduced Church Slavonic as the liturgical and literary language
- Established a tithe (10% of princely income) to support the Church

### Legal and Social Reforms

Vladimir's baptism led to significant social reforms:
- Modification of laws to align with Christian principles
- Reduction in capital punishment
- Establishment of Church courts for certain cases
- Improved status of women (though still limited by medieval standards)
- Creation of charitable institutions

## Historical Significance

Vladimir's conversion had far-reaching consequences that continue to shape Eastern European identity:

### Religious Impact

- Established Orthodox Christianity as the dominant faith of Eastern Slavs
- Created the foundation for the Russian Orthodox Church
- Aligned Eastern Slavic Christianity with Constantinople rather than Rome
- Established a distinctive Eastern Slavic form of Orthodox practice

### Cultural Orientation

- Integrated Kievan Rus' into Byzantine cultural sphere
- Introduced Byzantine art forms (especially iconography)
- Established Church Slavonic as a literary language
- Created a cultural foundation distinct from Western Europe

### Political Implications

- Provided ideological foundation for the Kievan state
- Established the "symphony" model of church-state relations
- Created a shared religious identity that survived political fragmentation
- Laid groundwork for the concept of Moscow as the "Third Rome"

## Legacy and Veneration

Vladimir died on July 15, 1015, and was buried in the Church of the Tithes in Kiev. Civil war broke out among his sons after his death, with two of them—Boris and Gleb—being murdered by their brother Sviatopolk. Boris and Gleb were later canonized as the first Russian saints.

Vladimir himself was canonized in the 13th century and given the rare title "Equal-to-the-Apostles" (Isapostolos) for his role in evangelizing the Eastern Slavs. His veneration includes:

- Churches dedicated to him throughout the Orthodox world
- His feast day celebrated on July 15 (July 28 in the New Calendar)
- Numerous icons depicting him holding a model of the Church of the Tithes
- The Order of St. Vladimir, an imperial Russian order of chivalry

## Modern Significance and Contested Legacy

Vladimir's legacy remains significant but is increasingly contested in the modern era:

### Religious Significance

- Continues to be venerated as a major saint in Orthodox churches
- The 1000th anniversary of his death in 2015 was marked with major celebrations
- His conversion is seen as the foundation of Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian Christianity

### National Identity

Vladimir's legacy is claimed by multiple modern nations:
- In Russia, he is viewed as the founder of Russian Orthodox civilization
- In Ukraine, he is known as Volodymyr and claimed as a Ukrainian national figure
- In Belarus, he is recognized as the baptizer of all East Slavic peoples

These competing claims have intensified with the political tensions between Russia and Ukraine, with both nations erecting prominent monuments to Vladimir/Volodymyr and emphasizing their connection to his legacy.

### Historical Reassessment

Modern historians have reassessed various aspects of Vladimir's story:
- The "testing of religions" narrative may be partly legendary
- Political and economic factors likely played a larger role than religious aesthetics
- The process of Christianization was more gradual than the chronicles suggest
- Pagan practices continued in rural areas for centuries after the official conversion

## Cultural Representations

Vladimir appears prominently in East Slavic culture:

- The Tale of Bygone Years (Primary Chronicle) presents the semi-legendary account of his conversion
- Medieval Russian literature includes numerous tales and hymns about him
- He features in Rimsky-Korsakov's opera "The Maid of Pskov"
- Modern films and television series in both Russia and Ukraine have depicted his life
- The Order of St. Vladimir was one of the highest honors in Imperial Russia
