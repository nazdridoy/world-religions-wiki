# Athanasius of Alexandria

![Athanasius](../../images/athanasius.jpg)

Athanasius of Alexandria (c. 296-373 CE), also known as Athanasius the Great or Athanasius the Confessor, was a Christian theologian, Church Father, and Bishop of Alexandria whose unwavering defense of Trinitarian theology against Arianism earned him the title "Father of Orthodoxy." His theological insights and persistence in defending the full divinity of Christ were instrumental in shaping Christian doctrine, particularly through his influence on the Nicene Creed.

## Historical Context

Born in Alexandria, Egypt, Athanasius lived during a tumultuous period in early Christian history when the Church, recently emerging from persecution, faced internal theological divisions. The Roman Empire had just embraced Christianity under Emperor Constantine, bringing new political dimensions to theological debates.

Athanasius served as secretary to Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, and accompanied him to the First Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, where he played a significant role despite his youth. He succeeded Alexander as bishop in 328 CE and would hold this position for 45 years, though often in exile due to his theological positions.

The central conflict of Athanasius's career was his opposition to Arianism, a theological view proposed by Arius, an Alexandrian priest, who taught that the Son (Jesus Christ) was created by the Father and therefore not co-eternal or consubstantial with Him. This controversy threatened the very understanding of Christ's nature and salvation in Christian theology.

## Theological Contributions

### Defense of the Trinity

Athanasius's most significant contribution was his tireless defense of the full divinity of Christ against Arianism. His key arguments included:

- If Christ is not fully divine, He cannot fully save humanity or bridge the gap between God and creation
- The incarnation requires full divinity; only God can save
- Worship of Christ as God from the earliest Christian times proves His divinity
- Biblical texts support the equality of the Son with the Father

His formula "The Word became man that we might become God" encapsulates his understanding of deification (theosis) as the purpose of Christ's incarnation.

### Christology

Athanasius developed a comprehensive Christology (doctrine of Christ) that emphasized:

- The unity of Christ's person as both fully divine and fully human
- The eternal generation of the Son from the Father
- The essential role of Christ's divinity in salvation
- The communicatio idiomatum (exchange of properties) between Christ's divine and human natures

These concepts became foundational for later Christological developments at the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon.

### Scriptural Canon

Athanasius played a crucial role in the development of the biblical canon. His 39th Festal Letter (367 CE) contains the first known listing of the 27 books of the New Testament as they are accepted today, helping to stabilize the biblical canon in the face of competing texts and interpretations.

## The Nicene Controversy

The conflict over Arianism dominated Athanasius's episcopate and much of 4th-century Christianity. Key events included:

- **Council of Nicaea (325)**: The council condemned Arianism and produced the original Nicene Creed, with Athanasius playing an influential role.
- **Five Exiles**: Political shifts in imperial favor led to Athanasius being exiled five times (335-337, 339-346, 356-362, 362-363, 365-366), spending a total of 17 years in exile.
- **Semi-Arianism**: Athanasius faced not only strict Arianism but also compromising positions like Semi-Arianism, which he also opposed.
- **Council of Alexandria (362)**: Under Athanasius's leadership, this council helped clarify terminology in the Trinitarian controversy.

Throughout these conflicts, Athanasius remained steadfast, leading to his famous epithet: "Athanasius contra mundum" (Athanasius against the world).

## Literary Works

Athanasius was a prolific writer whose works continue to influence Christian theology:

- **On the Incarnation**: His most famous work, presenting a comprehensive theology of Christ's incarnation and its purpose
- **Life of Anthony**: A biography of Anthony the Great that popularized monasticism and became a bestseller in the ancient world
- **Against the Arians**: A four-book refutation of Arian theology
- **Defense Against the Arians** and **History of the Arians**: Historical and apologetic accounts of the controversy
- **Festal Letters**: Annual pastoral letters announcing the date of Easter and addressing theological matters
- **On the Decrees of the Nicene Council**: A defense of Nicaea's decisions

His writing style combined theological depth with accessible language, making complex doctrines understandable to ordinary believers.

## Legacy and Influence

Athanasius's influence extends across Christian traditions:

- **Ecumenical Councils**: His theology was vindicated at the First Council of Constantinople (381) after his death
- **Eastern Orthodoxy**: Venerated as a saint and Doctor of the Church, feast day May 2
- **Roman Catholicism**: Named a Doctor of the Church in 1568
- **Anglicanism and Protestantism**: Respected for his biblical focus and defense of core doctrines
- **Coptic Church**: Considered the 20th Pope of Alexandria and champion of Egyptian Christianity

Athanasius represented the meeting point of Greek philosophical rigor and biblical faith, creating a theological synthesis that has endured for centuries.

## Character and Spirituality

Beyond his theological contributions, Athanasius was known for:

- **Ascetic tendencies**: His admiration for monastic discipline influenced his spirituality
- **Pastoral concern**: Despite theological battles, he remained devoted to his flock
- **Steadfast conviction**: Willing to suffer exile rather than compromise on truth
- **Relationships with desert monks**: His connections with Egyptian monasticism enriched his theology
- **Practical focus**: His theology always connected to the practical reality of salvation

These qualities have made him not only an intellectual figure but also a spiritual exemplar for many Christians.
