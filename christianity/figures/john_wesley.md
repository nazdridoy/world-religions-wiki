# John Wesley (1703-1791)

![John Wesley](../images/figures/john_wesley.jpg)

John Wesley was an English cleric, theologian, and evangelist who founded the Methodist movement. His influence extends far beyond Methodism, as his emphasis on personal holiness, social reform, and practical Christianity helped revitalize the Church of England and influenced Protestant Christianity worldwide. Wesley's commitment to "scriptural holiness" and his innovative methods of evangelism through field preaching and organized societies created a spiritual awakening that transformed 18th-century England and later America.

## Early Life and Education

John Wesley was born in Epworth, Lincolnshire, England, the fifteenth child of Samuel Wesley, an Anglican rector, and Susanna Wesley, a remarkable woman who provided him with a rigorous early education. In 1709, at age five, Wesley was dramatically rescued from the burning rectory, which he later described as being "plucked as a brand from the burning"—an experience he interpreted as God's providential preservation for a special purpose.

Wesley attended Charterhouse School in London before entering Christ Church, Oxford University in 1720. In 1726, he was elected a fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, where he formed the "Holy Club" with his brother Charles and others—a group dedicated to methodical Bible study, prayer, fasting, prison ministry, and care for the poor.

## Spiritual Journey and Conversion

Despite his rigorous religious practices, Wesley struggled with assurance of salvation. His missionary journey to the American colony of Georgia (1735-1738) proved largely unsuccessful and left him questioning his faith. The turning point came on May 24, 1738, at a Moravian meeting on Aldersgate Street in London, where Wesley experienced his famous "heart-warming" conversion:

>"I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death."

This experience transformed Wesley's ministry, shifting his emphasis from works to grace while maintaining the necessity of holiness.

## Methodist Movement and Ministry

Barred from many Anglican pulpits due to his evangelical zeal, Wesley adopted field preaching, proclaiming the gospel in open spaces to thousands. He traveled extensively across Britain, riding an estimated 250,000 miles on horseback and delivering over 40,000 sermons during his lifetime.

Wesley organized converts into societies, classes (small groups of 12), and bands for accountability and spiritual growth. His organizational genius created a structure that could nurture new believers while expanding rapidly. While Wesley never intended to create a separate denomination, remaining an Anglican priest until his death, his movement's growth and his ordination of ministers for America set Methodism on the path to becoming an independent church.

## Theological Contributions

Wesley's theological contributions include:

1. **Prevenient Grace**: The belief that God's grace works in people's lives before they are aware of it, enabling them to respond to salvation
2. **Entire Sanctification**: The doctrine that believers can experience a "second blessing" of perfect love toward God and neighbor in this life
3. **Practical Divinity**: An approach to theology that emphasized practical application over abstract speculation
4. **Quadrilateral**: Though formalized after Wesley's time, his theological method balanced Scripture (primary authority), tradition, reason, and experience

Wesley maintained a "middle way" between Calvinism and Arminianism, rejecting predestination while emphasizing both divine grace and human responsibility in salvation.

## Social Reform and Legacy

Wesley's spiritual revival had profound social implications. He advocated for:

- Abolition of slavery
- Prison reform
- Education for the poor
- Healthcare accessibility
- Economic justice
- Temperance

His pamphlet "Thoughts Upon Slavery" (1774) powerfully denounced the slave trade, and he encouraged his followers to engage in social action as an expression of their faith.

By the time of Wesley's death in 1791, Methodism had grown to 135,000 members. Today, his theological and organizational legacy continues in Methodist denominations worldwide with an estimated 75 million adherents. His emphasis on both personal and social holiness, "warming the heart" while "engaging the hands," continues to shape Protestant Christianity far beyond Methodism.
