The Virgin Mary (1st century BCE - 1st century CE), also known as Mary, Mother of Jesus, or the Blessed Virgin Mary, is revered as the mother of Jesus Christ. She occupies a unique position in Christianity as the woman chosen by God to bear the incarnate Son of God. While Christian denominations vary in their emphasis on Mary's role, she remains one of the most prominent figures in Christian tradition, art, and devotion.

## Biblical Accounts

Mary appears in several key New Testament passages:

- **The Annunciation**: The angel Gabriel announces to Mary that she will conceive and bear Jesus (Luke 1:26-38)
- **The Visitation**: Mary visits her relative Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist (Luke 1:39-56)
- **The Nativity**: Mary gives birth to Jesus in Bethlehem (Luke 2:1-20, Matthew 1:18-25)
- **The Presentation**: Mary and Joseph present infant Jesus in the Temple (Luke 2:22-40)
- **The Flight to Egypt**: Mary and Joseph flee with Jesus to escape Herod's massacre (Matthew 2:13-23)
- **Jesus at the Temple**: Mary and Joseph find 12-year-old Jesus teaching in the Temple (Luke 2:41-52)
- **The Wedding at Cana**: Mary prompts Jesus's first public miracle (John 2:1-12)
- **The Crucifixion**: Mary witnesses Jesus's death, and he entrusts her to the disciple John (John 19:25-27)
- **Pentecost**: Mary is present with the apostles when the Holy Spirit descends (Acts 1:14)

The Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55), Mary's song of praise during her visit to Elizabeth, represents one of the most significant expressions of her faith and theological perspective.

## Theological Significance
