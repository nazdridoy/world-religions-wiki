# Polycarp - Bishop of Smyrna and Martyr

![Polycarp](polycarp.jpg)

Polycarp of Smyrna (c. 69-155 CE) stands as one of the most venerated figures of early Christianity, connecting the apostolic age with the developing church of the second century. As a disciple of the Apostle John and bishop of Smyrna, he provides a direct link to the teachings of Jesus's original followers. His life epitomized steadfast faith and pastoral leadership, while his dramatic martyrdom became an inspiring model of Christian courage in the face of persecution. Both through his teaching and his final witness, Polycarp helped shape Christian identity during a formative period of church history.

## Key Attributes

- **Lived**: c. 69-155 CE
- **Position**: Bishop of Smyrna (modern Izmir, Turkey)
- **Discipleship**: Student of the Apostle John
- **Martyrdom**: Burned at the stake at approximately age 86
- **Writings**: Epistle to the Philippians (his only surviving writing)

## Historical Context

Polycarp lived during a pivotal transition period for early Christianity:

- **Post-Apostolic Era**: Most original apostles had died by the time of his ministry
- **Institutional Development**: Church structures were becoming more formalized
- **Doctrinal Clarification**: Defining orthodox belief against early heresies
- **Roman Persecution**: Christians faced sporadic but intense local persecutions
- **Geographical Expansion**: The faith was spreading throughout the Roman Empire

Smyrna (modern Izmir, Turkey) was one of the major Christian centers in Asia Minor, part of a region where Christianity took early and deep root. As one of the Seven Churches of Asia mentioned in Revelation, Smyrna held particular significance in early Christian consciousness.

## Early Life and Connection to the Apostles

Details of Polycarp's early life are limited, but according to tradition:

- He may have been born to Christian parents around 69 CE
- In his youth, he became a disciple of the Apostle John
- He was appointed bishop of Smyrna, possibly by John himself
- He knew others who had seen and heard the Lord

The testimony of Irenaeus, who heard Polycarp speak in his youth, reinforces this apostolic connection:

> "Polycarp was not only instructed by apostles, and conversed with many who had seen Christ, but was also, by apostles in Asia, appointed bishop of the Church in Smyrna."

This direct connection to the apostles gave Polycarp's teaching particular authority in addressing theological controversies of the early second century.

## Episcopal Ministry

As bishop of Smyrna for potentially over 50 years, Polycarp's leadership was characterized by:

### Pastoral Care
- Providing spiritual guidance to his congregation
- Maintaining apostolic teaching in its purity
- Supporting neighboring churches in times of need
- Opposing early heretical movements, particularly various forms of Gnosticism

### Defense of Orthodoxy
- Emphasizing the physical reality of Christ's incarnation against docetic tendencies
- Preserving authentic apostolic tradition
- Countering Marcion's rejection of the Old Testament
- Resisting early Valentinian Gnostic teachings

### Church Relations
- Maintaining communion between churches
- Corresponding with other Christian communities
- Visiting Rome to discuss the Easter observance date with Pope Anicetus
- Receiving figures like Ignatius of Antioch during their journeys

## Relationship with Ignatius of Antioch

Around 110 CE, Ignatius of Antioch visited Polycarp while being transported to Rome for martyrdom. This meeting of two apostolic fathers was significant:

- Ignatius wrote a personal letter to Polycarp, preserved to this day
- Polycarp collected and helped preserve Ignatius's letters
- Both shared concerns about church unity and proper doctrine
- Their correspondence gives insight into early church governance and challenges

Ignatius charged the younger bishop with maintaining communication with other churches, showing Polycarp's respected position even at a relatively early stage of his ministry.

## Writings and Teaching

Unlike some other early church fathers, Polycarp was not a prolific writer. His only surviving work is his Epistle to the Philippians, written shortly after Ignatius's visit. This letter:

- Exhorts believers to virtue and steadfastness
- Quotes extensively from the New Testament, showing early Christian use of these texts
- Emphasizes practical Christian living over theoretical theology
- Demonstrates Polycarp's familiarity with Paul's writings
- Shows his concern for proper church order and behavior

His teaching style was reportedly not original or speculative, but focused on faithfully transmitting what he had received from the apostles. Irenaeus noted that Polycarp would recite the very words and teachings of those who had seen the Lord.

## Theological Significance

Though not a systematic theologian, Polycarp's significance for Christian theology is substantial:

### Apostolic Tradition
His direct link to John made him a crucial witness to authentic apostolic teaching at a time when competing versions of Christianity were emerging.

### Scripture Usage
His letter demonstrates early Christian reliance on what would become the New Testament canon, showing how these texts were already being read as authoritative in the early second century.

### Christology
He consistently emphasized the real incarnation, suffering, and resurrection of Christ against docetic views that denied Christ's physical reality.

### Church Unity
Like his friend Ignatius, Polycarp stressed unity under episcopal leadership and proper order within the church.

## Martyrdom

The defining event of Polycarp's legacy was his martyrdom, described in the "Martyrdom of Polycarp," one of the earliest and most detailed martyrdom accounts outside the New Testament. This document relates:

- At age 86, Polycarp was arrested during a local persecution in Smyrna
- He was brought to the stadium for public trial before the proconsul
- When ordered to revile Christ to save himself, he replied: "Eighty-six years have I served him, and he has done me no wrong. How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?"
- He was sentenced to be burned alive but, according to the account, the flames formed an arch around him without touching him
- He was ultimately killed by a dagger thrust
- His followers collected his bones "more valuable than precious stones and more refined than gold"

This account shows several important elements:
- One of the earliest descriptions of Christian veneration of martyrs' relics
- The development of a distinct Christian martyrdom theology
- Public witness as a powerful testimony to non-Christians
- The courage that characterized early Christian responses to persecution

## Historical Significance

Polycarp's importance extends across several dimensions:

### Link to Apostolic Christianity
As one of the last living connections to those who knew Jesus, Polycarp provided crucial continuity between the first and second generations of Christians.

### Defender of Orthodoxy
His witness against early heretical movements helped define the boundaries of acceptable Christian teaching.

### Model Bishop
His long leadership of the Smyrnaean church established a pattern of episcopal authority and pastoral care.

### Transmitter of Tradition
His conservative approach to preserving apostolic teaching influenced later church leaders like Irenaeus.

## Legacy in Christian Tradition

Polycarp's impact continued long after his death:

### In Martyrology
His martyrdom account became a model for later martyrdom literature and inspired Christians facing persecution throughout subsequent centuries.

### In Church Governance
His model of episcopal leadership reinforced the developing structure of bishop-led churches.

### In Apostolic Succession
Later church leaders pointed to figures like Polycarp to establish their connection to apostolic teaching and authority.

### In Spirituality
His unwavering faith in the face of death became an exemplar of Christian devotion and sacrifice.

## Irenaeus's Testimony

Irenaeus of Lyons, who heard Polycarp speak in his youth, provided valuable testimony about him:

> "I can even describe the place where the blessed Polycarp used to sit and discourse... and how he related his conversations with John and with others who had seen the Lord, and how he remembered their words."

This connection between Polycarp and Irenaeus established a clear line of teaching from the apostles through the second century, which became important for addressing Gnostic challenges to orthodox Christianity.

## Commemoration and Veneration

Polycarp is venerated as a saint in virtually all Christian traditions that recognize saints:

- His feast day is celebrated on February 23 in Western Christianity
- Eastern Orthodox churches commemorate him on February 23 (Julian calendar) or February 25
- His martyrdom site in Smyrna became a place of pilgrimage
- Churches have been dedicated to him throughout the Christian world
- He is mentioned in the Roman Canon (Eucharistic Prayer I) of the Catholic Mass
