# Maria Skobtsova - Orthodox Nun, Resistance Figure, and Martyr

![Maria Skobtsova](maria_skobtsova.jpg)

Mother Maria Skobtsova (1891-1945), born Elizaveta Pilenko and also known as Maria of Paris, was a Russian Orthodox nun, poet, theological thinker, and member of the French Resistance during World War II. Her extraordinary life journey took her from the Russian aristocracy through revolutionary politics, intellectual circles of the Russian émigré community in Paris, and ultimately to a radical form of monastic service culminating in her death at Ravensbrück concentration camp. Canonized as a saint in 2004, Mother Maria exemplified a distinctly modern Orthodox spirituality that emphasized active love for one's neighbor over ritual observance. Her theological vision of "liturgy outside the church walls" and her sacrificial death saving Jewish children from Nazi persecution have made her an increasingly influential figure for Christians seeking to integrate contemplative faith with social action.

## Early Life and Revolutionary Period

Born to an aristocratic family in Riga (then part of the Russian Empire), Elizaveta Pilenko grew up in a privileged environment on her family's estate near Anapa on the Black Sea. Her father's early death prompted the family to move to St. Petersburg, where the intellectually precocious young woman was drawn into the vibrant cultural and political life of pre-revolutionary Russia.

Her early development included several seemingly contradictory threads:
- A deeply religious Orthodox upbringing
- Attraction to revolutionary politics and Marxist thought
- Serious engagement with poetry and philosophy
- A teenage religious crisis that led to atheism

By age 18, she had published poetry, married her first husband Dmitry Kuzmin-Karavayev (a Bolshevik), and become involved in radical political circles. Their marriage soon dissolved as her political views evolved.

The Russian Revolution of 1917 found her serving as mayor of her hometown of Anapa under the Provisional Government. When the Bolsheviks came to power, she was arrested and put on trial but was acquitted after a dramatic defense speech by a young lawyer who later became her second husband, Daniel Skobtsov.

## Exile and Intellectual Development

Fleeing the Bolsheviks, Elizaveta and her family emigrated first to Georgia, then to Constantinople, and finally settled in Paris in 1923, joining the large Russian émigré community there. This period was marked by:

- The death of her youngest daughter Anastasia from meningitis, a pivotal spiritual moment
- Divorce from her second husband
- Work with the Russian Student Christian Movement
- Growing reputation as a writer and thinker
- Deepening religious conviction and social commitment

In Paris, she immersed herself in the theological and philosophical renaissance of Russian Orthodoxy in exile. She engaged with thinkers like Nikolai Berdyaev, Sergei Bulgakov, and Mother Maria's spiritual father, Father Sergius Bulgakov, who were reformulating Orthodox thought in creative dialogue with contemporary challenges.

## Monastic Vocation and Social Service

After her daughter's death and the dissolution of her second marriage, Elizaveta experienced a profound spiritual transformation. In 1932, with the blessing of Metropolitan Evlogy, she took monastic vows and was tonsured as "Maria" while maintaining a highly unconventional form of monasticism focused on service in the world.

With her spiritual father's support, she established a house of hospitality at 77 rue de Lourmel in Paris that became both:
- A center for theological discussion and cultural events
- A soup kitchen and refuge for the unemployed, mentally ill, and homeless

Mother Maria described her approach as "monasticism in the world," rejecting the cloistered life for direct engagement with human suffering. She was known to say: "At the Last Judgment, I shall not be asked whether I satisfactorily practiced asceticism, nor how many prostrations I made before the altar. I shall be asked whether I fed the hungry, clothed the naked, visited the sick, and the prisoner in his jail."

## Theological Vision

Mother Maria developed a distinctive theological perspective characterized by:

### Liturgy Beyond the Church
She spoke of a "liturgy outside the church walls" where service to suffering humanity constitutes genuine worship of God. This view sometimes put her at odds with more traditional Orthodox monastics.

### Personalism
Influenced by the personalist philosophy current in France, she emphasized direct, personal encounters with the divine image in each human being, especially the marginalized.

### Creative Freedom
Mother Maria saw Christianity as demanding creative responses to human need rather than mere adherence to established forms.

### Kenotic Theology
Drawing on the Orthodox tradition of kenosis (self-emptying), she understood salvation as participation in Christ's self-giving love.

Her major theological writings include "Types of Religious Lives," which critiqued various inadequate approaches to Orthodox spirituality, and "The Mysticism of Human Communion," which articulated her vision of how the divine is encountered in human relationships.

## World War II and Resistance

When Nazi Germany occupied France, Mother Maria's community at rue de Lourmel immediately became involved in resistance activities:

- Providing refuge and false documents for Jews
- Hiding children from roundups
- Smuggling people to safety
- Offering spiritual and material support to the persecuted

In one particularly notable incident, Mother Maria gained access to the Vélodrome d'Hiver where thousands of Jews were held before deportation. She managed to smuggle out several Jewish children in garbage cans, saving them from transportation to concentration camps.

These activities were conducted with full awareness of the risks. When asked by a collaborationist priest how she could reconcile her actions with Scripture, Mother Maria replied: "There are times when the gospel command is simple: feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked. There are no canonical rules against saving Jews."

## Arrest, Imprisonment, and Death

In February 1943, the Gestapo arrested Mother Maria's son Yuri (who had been working with her in the resistance) and her chaplain Father Dimitri Klepinin. Soon after, Mother Maria herself was arrested.

After interrogation, they were deported to concentration camps:
- Yuri and Father Dimitri to Buchenwald, where both perished
- Mother Maria to Ravensbrück, the notorious women's concentration camp

At Ravensbrück, Mother Maria continued her ministry, providing spiritual support to fellow prisoners and sharing her meager rations. According to fellow inmates who survived, she remained a source of strength, organizing discussions of literature and faith, and creating embroidery art on scraps of cloth.

On Holy Saturday, March 31, 1945, just weeks before the camp's liberation, Mother Maria was selected for the gas chamber. Some accounts suggest she voluntarily took the place of another woman who had been selected. Her last act was to make the sign of the cross as she entered the chamber with a group of other women.

## Legacy and Canonization

For decades after World War II, Mother Maria's story remained relatively unknown outside Russian émigré circles. However, increased interest in her life and writings began in the 1980s, leading to:

- Publication of her complete works
- Translation of her writings into multiple languages
- Recognition as a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in 1985
- Canonization by the Ecumenical Patriarchate in 2004, along with her son Yuri, Father Dimitri Klepinin, and their collaborator Ilya Fondaminsky

Her feast day is celebrated on July 20, and her icon depicts her in her nun's habit wearing the concentration camp number 19263.

## Contemporary Relevance

Mother Maria's integration of contemplative faith with radical social action continues to speak to contemporary concerns:

- Her work bridges traditional Orthodox spirituality with modern engagement
- Her writings offer a theological foundation for Christian social action
- Her personal courage provides a model of resistance to oppression
- Her unconventional monasticism suggests alternative forms of religious commitment

Orthodox theologian Olivier Clément described her significance: "In Mother Maria we find a synthesis, rare in our time, of a deep, traditional spirituality with a creative, unfettered engagement with the problems of this world."
