# Pope John XXIII - The Good Pope

![Pope John XXIII](john_xxiii.jpg)

Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, who became Pope John XXIII (1881-1963), was one of the most beloved and transformative pontiffs of the twentieth century. Often called "Il Papa Buono" (The Good Pope), his brief papacy (1958-1963) initiated a period of unprecedented renewal and modernization in the Roman Catholic Church through his convocation of the Second Vatican Council. With his warm personality, pastoral sensitivity, and commitment to aggiornamento ("bringing up to date"), John XXIII broke through centuries of ecclesiastical formality to engage more directly with both Catholics and non-Catholics, setting a new direction for the Church's relationship with the modern world. His canonization in 2014 recognized both his personal holiness and his prophetic vision for the Church.

## Early Life and Formation

Angelo Roncalli was born to a family of sharecroppers in the small village of Sotto il Monte in northern Italy. Despite their poverty, his family was rich in faith, and Angelo developed a deep spirituality from an early age. With the support of his local parish priest, he entered the seminary in Bergamo at age 11 and later continued his studies at the Pontifical Roman Seminary.

Ordained a priest in 1904, Father Roncalli served initially as secretary to the Bishop of Bergamo, where he gained experience in pastoral administration. During World War I, he served as a stretcher-bearer and chaplain in the Italian Army, experiences that deepened his commitment to peace and his compassion for human suffering.

## Diplomatic Career

In 1925, Roncalli's career took a significant turn when he was appointed Apostolic Visitor to Bulgaria, beginning his diplomatic service to the Holy See. He was consecrated as a bishop with the titular see of Areopolis. His subsequent diplomatic assignments included:

- **Apostolic Delegate to Bulgaria** (1925-1935): Working with a predominantly Orthodox Christian population, he learned the importance of ecumenical dialogue.
- **Apostolic Delegate to Turkey and Greece** (1935-1944): During World War II, he used his diplomatic position to help many Jews escape persecution by providing them with transit visas and other documents.
- **Apostolic Nuncio to France** (1944-1953): In post-war France, he navigated complex church-state relations and helped reconcile tensions between the Vatican and France regarding pro-German bishops.

In 1953, Roncalli was created a cardinal and appointed Patriarch of Venice, where he expected to spend his final years as a pastoral leader. However, just five years later, following the death of Pope Pius XII, he was elected pope, reportedly saying to his staff before leaving for the conclave: "I'll pack a small suitcase, and then I'll be back."

## Papal Election and Early Initiatives

Cardinal Roncalli was elected pope on October 28, 1958, taking the name John XXIII. At 76, he was widely expected to be a transitional pope who would make few changes. However, he quickly surprised both the Church and the world with his energy and his willingness to break with convention.

Within his first few months as pope, John XXIII:
- Expanded the College of Cardinals beyond its traditional limit of 70 members
- Became the first pope since 1870 to make pastoral visits outside the Vatican, visiting Roman parishes, hospitals, and prisons
- Removed controversial phrases about Jews from the Good Friday liturgy
- Strengthened diplomatic ties with nations across political divides
- Created a new tone of dialogue and openness in Vatican communications

Perhaps most significantly, just three months into his papacy, on January 25, 1959, he shocked the world by announcing his intention to convene an ecumenical council—the first in nearly a century—to renew the Church and promote Christian unity.

## The Second Vatican Council

The Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), which opened on October 11, 1962, stands as Pope John XXIII's greatest legacy. Though he would not live to see its completion in 1965, his vision shaped its direction and outcomes. In his opening address, he articulated the council's purpose:

"What is needed at the present time is a new enthusiasm, a new joy and serenity of mind in the unreserved acceptance by all of the entire Christian faith... The substance of the ancient doctrine of the deposit of faith is one thing, and the way in which it is presented is another."

John XXIII wanted the Church to speak to the modern world in a new way—not changing its fundamental teachings but expressing them in language that contemporary people could understand and appreciate. He called this approach aggiornamento, or "bringing up to date."

The Council's eventual outcomes included:
- Liturgical reform, including permission for Mass in vernacular languages
- A new emphasis on the Church as "the People of God"
- Enhanced roles for laity in Church life
- Greater collegiality among bishops
- Religious freedom as a fundamental right
- Positive engagement with other Christian denominations and world religions
- A more open relationship between the Church and the modern world

Though John XXIII did not micromanage the Council's deliberations, his pastoral vision and open spirit permeated its proceedings and documents.

## Social Teaching and Encyclicals

Pope John XXIII authored eight encyclicals during his papacy, addressing both internal Church matters and broader social issues. His most significant encyclicals include:

### Mater et Magistra (1961)
This encyclical updated Catholic social teaching for the post-World War II era, addressing issues such as:
- Economic disparities between nations
- The rights of workers
- Agricultural policy
- Population growth
- International cooperation

### Pacem in Terris (1963)
Published just two months before his death, this landmark encyclical was addressed not only to Catholics but to "all men of good will." It outlined conditions necessary for world peace based on:
- Human rights and dignity
- Proper relations between individuals and states
- The necessity of international structures for peace
- Disarmament and reduction of nuclear weapons
- The common good of the entire human family

This was the first papal encyclical addressed to all people, not just Catholics, and represented a significant opening of dialogue with the broader world.

## Ecumenical and Interfaith Relations

John XXIII made historic strides in improving relations with other Christian denominations and non-Christian faiths:

- He created the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity in 1960
- He welcomed numerous non-Catholic religious leaders to the Vatican
- He removed obstacles to dialogue with Eastern Orthodox churches
- He initiated reforms in language about Jews in Catholic liturgy and teaching

An often-cited story involves his response when asked how many people worked in the Vatican: "About half of them," he quipped, demonstrating his realistic and humble assessment of human nature.

## Final Illness and Death

In late 1962, Pope John was diagnosed with stomach cancer. As his health deteriorated through early 1963, he continued working to advance the Council's agenda. His final days saw an unprecedented outpouring of global concern and prayer, with people of all faiths gathering in St. Peter's Square to keep vigil.

He died on June 3, 1963, after saying, "Today more than ever, certainly more than in previous centuries, we are called to serve man as such, and not merely Catholics; to defend above all and everywhere the rights of the human person, and not merely those of the Catholic Church."

His death prompted mourning far beyond Catholic circles, with tributes from world leaders of all political and religious backgrounds, testifying to his universal appeal and impact.

## Legacy and Canonization

Pope John XXIII's impact on the Catholic Church and the world continued long after his death:

- The Second Vatican Council was completed under his successor, Pope Paul VI, with profound effects on Catholic worship, theology, and engagement with the world
- His emphasis on dialogue rather than condemnation set a new tone for Church relations with modern society
- His warm, pastoral style influenced subsequent popes, particularly Pope Francis
- His social teachings on human rights, peace, and economic justice advanced Catholic social doctrine

Pope John Paul II beatified him on September 3, 2000. In a remarkable gesture, Pope Francis canonized both John XXIII and John Paul II together on April 27, 2014, recognizing the complementary contributions of these two influential popes despite their different approaches and emphases.

## Personal Character

Those who knew Pope John XXIII consistently emphasized certain personal qualities:

### Humility and Humor
John frequently made self-deprecating jokes about his short, rotund appearance and humble origins. When asked how many people worked in the Vatican, he famously replied, "About half of them."

### Pastoral Sensitivity
He maintained his identity as a pastor even in the papacy, caring deeply about the spiritual and material welfare of ordinary people.

### Spiritual Depth
His personal journal, "Journal of a Soul," revealed a profound prayer life and spiritual discipline maintained throughout his life.

### Simplicity
Despite the grandeur of the papal office, he maintained a straightforward approach to life and leadership, once saying: "It often happens that I wake at night and begin to think about a serious problem and decide I must tell the Pope about it. Then I wake up completely and remember that I am the Pope."
