# Pope Pius V - Counter-Reformation Pope and Reformer

![Pope Pius V](pius_v.jpg)

Pope Pius V (1504-1572), born Antonio Ghislieri, was a pivotal Counter-Reformation pope whose austere personal life and reforming zeal dramatically transformed the Catholic Church following the Council of Trent. Rising from humble origins through the Dominican Order, he became known for his uncompromising implementation of Tridentine reforms, standardization of Catholic liturgy through the Roman Missal, and fierce opposition to Protestantism. His excommunication of Queen Elizabeth I and formation of the Holy League that defeated Ottoman forces at the Battle of Lepanto demonstrated his readiness to confront both spiritual and physical threats to Catholicism. Though his strict enforcement of Church discipline and expanded powers of the Inquisition remain controversial, his commitment to purifying Church practice and his personal asceticism earned him canonization in 1712.
