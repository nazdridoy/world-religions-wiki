# Bernard of Clairvaux - Cistercian Abbot, Mystic, and Church Reformer

![Bernard of Clairvaux](bernard_clairvaux.jpg)

Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153) was one of the most influential figures of 12th-century Christianity—a charismatic abbot, mystical theologian, and powerful ecclesiastical statesman whose extraordinary personal magnetism and spiritual authority shaped the course of Western monasticism and the broader Church. As the primary builder of the Cistercian Order, Bernard advocated a return to the austere simplicity of the original Benedictine Rule while developing a rich theology of mystical love. His passionate preaching, prolific writings, and direct involvement in ecclesiastical and political affairs made him perhaps the most prominent Christian leader of his age, earning him the informal title "the uncrowned pope of Christendom."

## Early Life and Conversion

Bernard was born in 1090 to an aristocratic Burgundian family at the castle of Fontaine-lès-Dijon. His father, Tescelin de Fontaine, was a knight and vassal of the Duke of Burgundy, and his mother, Aleth of Montbard, was known for her piety. The third of seven children, Bernard received an excellent education in the liberal arts at the church school of Châtillon-sur-Seine.

Following his mother's death when he was about 17, Bernard experienced a gradual spiritual awakening. After a period of worldly living, he experienced what he later described as a profound conversion around the age of 22. In 1112, in a characteristic display of his charismatic leadership, Bernard persuaded about 30 relatives and friends—including four of his brothers, an uncle, and several noblemen—to join him in entering the monastery of Cîteaux, a struggling new foundation established in 1098 that sought to restore the literal observance of the Rule of St. Benedict.

## Monastic Leadership and Cistercian Expansion

Three years after entering Cîteaux, Bernard was sent with twelve monks to establish a new monastery in a remote valley called the "Valley of Wormwood" (later renamed "Clairvaux" or Valley of Light). As the founding abbot of Clairvaux at the remarkably young age of 25, Bernard faced initial challenges, including harsh living conditions and his own excessive austerities that damaged his health.

Under Bernard's leadership, Clairvaux grew rapidly in both size and reputation. His magnetic personality and reputation for holiness attracted numerous vocations, many from noble families and educated backgrounds. During his lifetime, Bernard personally founded 68 monasteries across Europe, while Clairvaux generated a total of 164 foundations. By the time of his death, the Cistercian Order had expanded from a single monastery to over 340 houses, largely due to his influence.

Bernard's monastic vision emphasized:
- Literal adherence to the Benedictine Rule
- Physical labor balanced with prayer and study
- Radical simplicity in architecture, liturgy, and daily life
- Retreat from direct involvement with secular society (though Bernard himself would often depart from this ideal)
- Geographic isolation in uncultivated areas
- Self-sufficiency through agricultural labor

## Ecclesiastical and Political Engagement

Despite his preference for contemplative seclusion, Bernard became increasingly drawn into Church politics and doctrinal controversies, eventually becoming the most influential ecclesiastical figure of his generation.

### Papal Schism of 1130

When a contested papal election in 1130 resulted in the simultaneous claims of Pope Innocent II and Antipope Anacletus II, Bernard emerged as the decisive advocate for Innocent. Through his forceful preaching, diplomatic skills, and personal influence, he secured the recognition of Innocent II by most European rulers, including Emperor Lothair III, Henry I of England, and Louis VI of France. The schism ended in 1138 with Innocent's final triumph.

### Intellectual Controversies

Bernard vigorously opposed what he saw as dangerous philosophical innovations in theology, particularly in his disputes with Peter Abelard, the leading dialectician of the age. In 1140, Bernard orchestrated Abelard's condemnation at the Council of Sens, objecting to Abelard's rational approach to faith and his questioning of traditional doctrines.

He also confronted Gilbert de la Porrée, whose philosophical distinctions regarding the Trinity Bernard considered dangerous, though with less success than his campaign against Abelard.

### Preaching of the Second Crusade

In 1146, at the request of Pope Eugenius III (who had been Bernard's monk at Clairvaux), Bernard preached the Second Crusade throughout France and Germany. His passionate appeals recruited both King Louis VII of France and Emperor Conrad III of Germany to lead the expedition. The ultimate failure of this crusade caused Bernard considerable personal anguish and temporarily damaged his reputation.

### Defense Against Heresy

Bernard traveled extensively to combat heretical movements, particularly in Southern France where he confronted the followers of Henry of Lausanne and Peter of Bruys. His method typically combined public preaching with personal engagement, relying on his charismatic personality and rhetorical skill rather than force.

## Theological and Spiritual Contributions

Bernard's theological contributions center on the soul's relationship with God through mystical love, the humanity of Christ, and Marian devotion.

### Mystical Theology

Bernard's most significant theological legacy lies in his mystical writings, particularly his unfinished series of 86 sermons on the Song of Songs. In these, he develops a profound theology of spiritual love, describing the soul's gradual ascent toward union with God through distinct stages of love:

1. Love of self for self's sake (self-centeredness)
2. Love of God for self's sake (seeking divine benefits)
3. Love of God for God's sake (genuine devotion)
4. Love of self for God's sake (ultimate sanctification)

For Bernard, the path to God was not primarily through intellectual understanding but through affective experience—love and desire rather than reason. As he famously stated, "God is not known by syllogisms."

### Christology

Bernard emphasized the humanity of Christ and encouraged affective devotion to Jesus, particularly in his meditation on Christ's passion. He promoted a personal, emotional identification with the suffering Christ as the path to spiritual transformation.

His writings about Jesus' humanity and suffering became immensely influential in medieval spirituality, helping to develop the tradition of affective piety that would characterize later medieval devotion.

### Mariology

Bernard made significant contributions to the development of Marian devotion. He portrayed Mary as the ideal disciple, the channel through which divine grace flows to humanity, and a compassionate intercessor. His sermons exalting Mary's virtues and role in salvation history earned him the title "Marian Doctor."

His famous "Memorare" prayer begins: "Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thy intercession was left unaided..."

## Literary Works

Bernard was a prolific author whose writings reveal both his spiritual depth and his rhetorical brilliance. His major works include:

- **_De Gradibus Humilitatis et Superbiae_** (The Steps of Humility and Pride) - His first treatise, exploring the virtues and vices central to monastic life
- **_De Diligendo Deo_** (On Loving God) - A profound exploration of the soul's journey to God through love
- **_Sermons on the Song of Songs_** - His masterpiece of mystical theology, using the biblical love poetry as a framework for exploring the relationship between Christ and the soul
- **_De Consideratione_** (On Consideration) - Addressed to Pope Eugenius III, offering guidance on papal responsibilities and spiritual life
- **_Apologia ad Guillelmum Abbatem_** (A Defense to Abbot William) - A critique of Cluniac monastic excesses and defense of Cistercian austerity
- **_De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio_** (On Grace and Free Choice) - His contribution to theological debates on predestination and free will
- **_Vita Prima Sancti Malachiae_** (Life of St. Malachy) - Biography of his friend, the Irish saint Malachy O'More

Additionally, nearly 500 of his letters survive, addressing correspondents ranging from popes and emperors to humble monks, on topics spanning spiritual direction, ecclesiastical politics, and theological controversies.

## Character and Personality

Contemporary accounts portray Bernard as a complex figure of extraordinary personal magnetism. William of St. Thierry, his friend and biographer, described his physical appearance as "delicate and weak," with a "body most delicate and without flesh," and "a face sunburnt and fair." Despite his physical frailty (exacerbated by his excessive asceticism), Bernard possessed remarkable energy and willpower.

His personality combined apparently contradictory qualities:
- Genuinely humble in his personal life yet confident in exercising authority
- Deeply contemplative yet extraordinarily active in worldly affairs
- Tender and compassionate in spiritual direction yet sometimes harsh in theological disputes
- Physically frail yet capable of extraordinary endurance in his travels and labors

His eloquence was legendary, described by contemporaries as supernaturally persuasive. One account claims that German mothers hid their sons when Bernard came to preach the Crusade, fearing they would be unable to resist joining.

## Legacy and Influence

Bernard died at Clairvaux on August 20, 1153, having guided the monastery for 38 years. He was canonized just 21 years after his death by Pope Alexander III.

His influence on Christianity has been enduring in multiple spheres:

### Monastic Development
The Cistercian model Bernard championed—emphasizing simplicity, manual labor, and geographical isolation—became a powerful reforming influence on Western monasticism. The distinctive Cistercian architectural style, featuring unadorned spaces that emphasized light and proportion rather than decoration, reflected Bernard's theology of divine simplicity.

### Spiritual Theology
Bernard's affective mysticism, emphasizing the role of personal experience and love in the spiritual life, influenced countless later mystics and spiritual writers. His focus on Christ's humanity and suffering became a cornerstone of medieval devotion, particularly influencing the Franciscan tradition.

### Marian Devotion
His writings and sermons on Mary contributed significantly to the development of Marian piety in Western Christianity. Many Marian prayers and hymns, including the last part of the "Hail Holy Queen," are attributed to him.

### Church Leadership
Bernard established a model of monastic involvement in Church affairs that, though sometimes at odds with his own Cistercian ideals, demonstrated the moral authority monks could wield in ecclesiastical and even political matters.
