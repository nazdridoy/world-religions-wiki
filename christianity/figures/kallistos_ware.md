## Early Life and Conversion

Timothy Ware was born into an Anglican family in Bath, England. As a child, he had a profound religious experience during a Scripture lesson that instilled in him a deep awareness of the reality of God's presenceâ€”a foundational moment that would shape his lifelong spiritual journey.

Educated at Westminster School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied classics and theology, Ware's spiritual search led him to explore various Christian traditions. His first encounter with Orthodox Christianity came when he stumbled upon a Russian Orthodox church in London:

> "I was overwhelmed by a sense that the worship belonged not only to earth but also to heaven... I felt I had come home."

After further exploration and study, including visits to Orthodox communities in Greece, he was received into the Orthodox Church in 1958, taking the name Kallistos (meaning "most beautiful," a reference to Christ).

## Religious Career

After his conversion, Kallistos's path led him to monastic life and priesthood:
