# Mother Teresa (1910-1997)

![Mother Teresa](../images/figures/mother_teresa.jpg)

Mother Teresa, born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, was an Albanian-Indian Roman Catholic nun and missionary who founded the Missionaries of Charity. Dedicating her life to serving "the poorest of the poor," she became an international symbol of compassionate service and selfless love. Her work among the sick, dying, orphaned, and destitute in the slums of Calcutta (now Kolkata) brought global attention to the plight of the marginalized. Recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize and canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, her life exemplified Christian charity in action, though not without controversy and complexity.

## Early Life and Calling

Born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje (now North Macedonia, then part of the Ottoman Empire), Anjezë was raised in a devout Albanian Catholic family. Her father's sudden death when she was eight left the family in financial difficulties, but her mother's strong faith and charitable activities profoundly influenced young Anjezë's spiritual formation.

At age 12, she felt her first calling to religious life after hearing stories of missionaries serving in Bengal. By 18, resolved to become a missionary, she joined the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish community of nuns with missions in India. After initial training in Dublin, where she took the name Sister Mary Teresa (after St. Thérèse of Lisieux), she arrived in India in 1929 and began teaching at St. Mary's School for girls in Calcutta.

Sister Teresa took her initial vows in 1931 and her final vows in 1937, becoming "Mother Teresa" as was customary for Loreto nuns who were teachers. For nearly twenty years, she taught geography and catechism at St. Mary's, eventually becoming principal.

## The "Call Within a Call"

On September 10, 1946, during a train journey from Calcutta to Darjeeling for her annual retreat, Mother Teresa experienced what she described as her "call within a call." She recounted:

>"I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to break the faith."

This profound mystical experience convinced her that Christ was calling her to serve the poorest of the poor by living among them. After nearly two years of petitioning, in 1948 she received permission from Pope Pius XII, via the Archbishop of Calcutta, to leave her convent and work among the poor.

After medical training with the Medical Mission Sisters in Patna, Mother Teresa returned to Calcutta and found temporary housing with the Little Sisters of the Poor. On December 21, 1948, she ventured into the slums for the first time, wearing a simple white cotton sari with blue borders—the garment that would become the signature habit of her order.

## Missionaries of Charity

Beginning with a small school in the slums, Mother Teresa soon began caring for the sick and dying on the streets. In 1950, she received Vatican permission to start her own order, the Missionaries of Charity, with the mission to care for "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone."

The order began with just 13 members in Calcutta but grew rapidly. By the time of Mother Teresa's death in 1997, it had over 4,000 sisters operating 610 missions in 123 countries. Their work expanded to include:

- Hospices for the dying
- Homes for abandoned children
- Care centers for those with leprosy and HIV/AIDS
- Soup kitchens
- Mobile clinics
- Schools
- Family counseling programs

The Missionaries of Charity took vows of chastity, poverty, obedience, and "wholehearted and free service to the poorest of the poor." Living in radical simplicity, the sisters owned minimal possessions and received no salary.

## Spirituality and Approach to Suffering

Mother Teresa's spirituality centered on seeing Christ in the faces of the suffering poor. She emphasized:

>"The poor give us much more than we give them. They're not dependent on us, we're dependent on them... They're such strong people, living day to day with no food. And they never curse, never complain."

Her approach to poverty was not primarily focused on systemic change or social justice advocacy, but on direct service with love. She famously said:

>"We are not social workers. We may be doing social work in the eyes of people, but we are contemplatives in the heart of the world."

For Mother Teresa, suffering itself held spiritual value when united with Christ's suffering. She taught the dying to accept their pain as a share in Christ's passion. This theological approach to suffering has been both praised as profoundly Christian and criticized as potentially romanticizing poverty.

## International Recognition and Influence

By the 1970s, Mother Teresa had become internationally known, largely through Malcolm Muggeridge's 1969 documentary and 1971 book, both titled *Something Beautiful for God*. Her global prominence grew with numerous honors:

- The Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971)
- The Templeton Prize (1973)
- The Nobel Peace Prize (1979)
- The Presidential Medal of Freedom (1985)
- The Congressional Gold Medal (1997)

When accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, Mother Teresa spoke not of geopolitics but of abortion as "the greatest destroyer of peace today," reflecting her consistently traditional Catholic moral positions.

Her international reputation gave her unprecedented access to world leaders and donors, allowing her order to expand globally. She used this platform to consistently advocate for the sanctity of life from conception to natural death.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite her iconic status, Mother Teresa faced significant criticism. Major critiques include:

1. **Medical Care Standards**: Critics like Christopher Hitchens and Aroup Chatterjee alleged that the Missionaries of Charity homes offered inadequate medical care, reused needles, and misdiagnosed patients.

2. **Financial Opacity**: Questions arose about the management of significant donations, with limited transparency about fund allocation.

3. **Conversions**: Some claimed her humanitarian work had evangelistic motives, though there is little evidence of forced conversions.

4. **Relationships with Controversial Figures**: Her acceptance of donations from and friendships with questionable figures like Jean-Claude Duvalier and Charles Keating raised ethical concerns.

5. **Glorification of Suffering**: Her view that suffering brought one closer to Christ was critiqued as potentially justifying rather than alleviating misery.

Defenders counter that these criticisms often misunderstand her primary mission, which was to provide a dignified place for the destitute to die rather than sophisticated medical facilities, and that her work must be understood within its resource-limited context.

## Dark Night of the Soul

Perhaps the most surprising revelation after Mother Teresa's death came through her private writings, published in the book *Come Be My Light* (2007). These revealed that for much of her ministry—from 1948 almost until her death—she experienced a profound spiritual darkness, feeling no sensible presence of God:

>"Where is my faith? Even deep down... there is nothing but emptiness and darkness... If there be God—please forgive me. When I try to raise my thoughts to Heaven, there is such convicting emptiness that those very thoughts return like sharp knives and hurt my very soul... How painful is this unknown pain—I have no faith."

Despite this interior desolation, she persevered in her work with unwavering dedication. Theologians have interpreted this "dark night of the soul" (a term from St. John of the Cross) as both a profound spiritual trial and a mystical sharing in Christ's experience of abandonment on the cross.

## Legacy and Canonization

Mother Teresa died on September 5, 1997, at age 87. Her funeral was attended by dignitaries from over 80 countries, and the Indian government honored her with a state funeral.

Pope John Paul II waived the customary five-year waiting period and initiated her beatification process just two years after her death. She was beatified on October 19, 2003, after the Vatican recognized the miraculous healing of an Indian woman with an abdominal tumor. A second miracle, the healing of a Brazilian man with brain tumors, was recognized in 2015.

On September 4, 2016, Pope Francis canonized her as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, with approximately 120,000 people attending the ceremony in St. Peter's Square.

Her legacy continues through:
- The Missionaries of Charity, which continues to operate globally
- The international recognition of September 5 as the International Day of Charity
- Her example inspiring countless humanitarian efforts worldwide
- Her spiritual writings on serving Christ in the distressing disguise of the poor

Mother Teresa remains a complex figure whose life continues to challenge both religious and secular understandings of service, suffering, and sanctity. Her simple message—"Do small things with great love"—continues to inspire people across religious and cultural divides.
