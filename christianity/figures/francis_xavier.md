![Francis Xavier](francis_xavier.jpg)

Francis Xavier (1506-1552) was a Spanish Jesuit missionary and co-founder of the Society of Jesus who became one of the greatest Christian missionaries in history. His tireless evangelistic journeys took him through India, Southeast Asia, and Japan, earning him the title "Apostle of the Indies" and "Apostle of Japan." A close companion of Ignatius Loyola, Xavier embodied the early Jesuit ideal of scholarly dedication combined with missionary zeal. His methods of cultural adaptation, language learning, and focus on reaching influential societal members became a model for Catholic missions. Despite his relatively short life, Xavier's extraordinary missionary accomplishments, reported miracles, and personal charisma left an indelible mark on the global spread of Christianity, particularly in Asia.
