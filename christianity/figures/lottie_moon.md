![Lottie Moon portrait](lottie_moon.jpg)

Charlotte "Lottie" Diggs Moon stands as one of Christianity's most celebrated missionaries, whose four decades of service in China transformed Protestant mission practice and whose sacrificial example continues to inspire global mission efforts today. A brilliant scholar who rejected comfortable American life to serve in remote Chinese villages, Moon pioneered women's leadership in missions, contextualized evangelism approaches, and advocated for equitable support of international missions, leaving a legacy that extends far beyond the thousands of Chinese converts who came to faith through her ministry.
