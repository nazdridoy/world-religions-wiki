# Photius - Patriarch of Constantinople, Scholar, and Central Figure in the East-West Schism

![Photius](photius.jpg)

Photius (c. 810-893), sometimes referred to as Photius the Great, stands as one of the most significant and controversial figures in medieval Eastern Christianity. A brilliant scholar, theologian, and ecclesiastical statesman, he served twice as Patriarch of Constantinople during a tumultuous period when the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity were growing increasingly alienated. Photius's conflicts with Rome over jurisdictional authority, theological differences, and missionary territory profoundly shaped the development of the Orthodox Church and contributed to the growing estrangement between Eastern and Western Christianity. His vast erudition and literary contributions also make him one of the outstanding intellectual figures of the Byzantine world.

## Early Life and Career

Photius was born around 810 in Constantinople to noble parents, Sergius and Irene, who were ardent defenders of icon veneration during the iconoclastic controversies. His parents were martyred for their opposition to iconoclasm when Photius was young. Despite this family tragedy, Photius received an exceptional education in grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, theology, medicine, and science.

Before entering ecclesiastical life, Photius served as a diplomat and imperial secretary at the Byzantine court. He also taught philosophy and theology in Constantinople, earning him considerable renown as a scholar. His pupils included many future church leaders and the missionary Saint Cyril, who with his brother Methodius would later evangelize the Slavic peoples.

Photius's initial career was primarily secular and scholarly. He rose to the position of _protasekretis_ (first imperial secretary) and served on diplomatic missions for the Byzantine Empire. His extraordinary erudition and mastery of classical learning earned him the informal title "the Secular."

## First Patriarchate and Conflict with Rome

### The "Photian Controversy"

In 858, Emperor Michael III and his uncle Caesar Bardas engineered the deposition of Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople and rapidly elevated Photius—then a layman—through all clerical ranks to the patriarchate within six days. This irregular succession became the catalyst for what is often called the "Photian Schism" or "Photian Controversy."

Supporters of the deposed Ignatius appealed to Pope Nicholas I, who seized the opportunity to assert papal authority over Constantinople. In 863, a Roman synod declared Photius's elevation invalid and excommunicated him. Photius responded decisively, convening a council in Constantinople in 867 that:

1. Condemned Western missionary activities in the newly converted Bulgaria (a territory both Rome and Constantinople claimed)
2. Criticized various Latin practices, such as clerical celibacy and fasting on Saturdays
3. Most significantly, denounced the Western addition of the _Filioque_ clause ("and from the Son") to the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed
4. Excommunicated Pope Nicholas I

This council marked the first formal theological condemnation by Constantinople of the _Filioque_ addition—a theological difference that would remain a primary point of contention between Eastern and Western Christianity.

### Theological Objection to the Filioque

Photius's specific theological objection to the _Filioque_ hinged on both procedural and doctrinal concerns. He argued that:
- The unilateral addition to a creed established by ecumenical councils violated ecclesiological protocol
- The formulation compromised monotheism by suggesting two principles/sources of divinity within the Trinity
- It diminished the distinctive hypostatic property of the Father as the sole source of divinity

His articulation of these concerns in his work _Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit_ provided what would become the standard Eastern Orthodox position on this theological issue.

### Political Reversal and Deposition

In September 867, a palace coup led by Basil I resulted in the murder of Emperor Michael III. The new emperor restored Ignatius to the patriarchate and banished Photius to a monastery. Pope Adrian II, Nicholas's successor, announced victory and convened a council in Constantinople (869-870), later recognized by the Catholic Church as the Eighth Ecumenical Council, which anathematized Photius and reaffirmed papal authority.

## Second Patriarchate and Reconciliation

After a decade in exile, during which Photius maintained cordial relations with Ignatius, Photius was recalled to Constantinople to tutor the imperial children. When Ignatius died in 877, Photius was restored as patriarch, this time with proper canonical procedure and papal recognition from Pope John VIII.

A council held in Constantinople in 879-880 (recognized by the Orthodox Church as the Eighth Ecumenical Council) officially rehabilitated Photius, annulled the previous council against him, and temporarily resolved the jurisdictional dispute over Bulgaria. Significantly, this council also reaffirmed the original Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed without the _Filioque_ addition, with papal legates present and assenting.

This period of rapprochement, however, was short-lived. After Emperor Basil I's death in 886, his successor Leo VI (who disliked Photius, his former tutor) deposed the patriarch and confined him to the Armenian monastery of Bordi, where Photius died on February 6, 893.

## Scholarly Works and Intellectual Legacy

Beyond his ecclesiastical controversies, Photius's true historical significance lies in his extraordinary scholarship and preservation of classical and early Christian texts. His major works include:

### Bibliotheca (Myriobiblon)

Photius's most enduring contribution to world culture is his _Bibliotheca_ (or _Myriobiblon_), written during his embassy to Baghdad before his first patriarchate. This monumental work contains reviews and summaries of 280 books, many of which are otherwise lost to history. It includes critical analyses of works by classical authors, Church Fathers, historians, orators, lexicographers, and medical writers, providing modern scholars with invaluable information about texts that would otherwise be completely unknown.

### Lexicon

His _Lexicon_ is a significant dictionary of difficult words and expressions found in classical Greek texts, drawing on earlier lexicographical works but containing original contributions. This work helped preserve understanding of classical Greek during a period when the living language was evolving significantly.

### Amphilochia

The _Amphilochia_ consists of approximately 300 questions and answers on difficult passages in Scripture, addressing theological, philosophical, and interpretive issues. Written in response to questions from his student Amphilochius of Cyzicus, it demonstrates both Photius's exegetical skill and his theological sophistication.

### Theological Works

Other significant theological writings include:
- _Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit_ - His comprehensive treatise against the _Filioque_ doctrine
- _Against the Manichaeans_ - A refutation of dualist heresies
- Homilies and encyclical letters that articulate Orthodox doctrines and ecclesiastical positions

## Religious and Cultural Impact

Photius's influence on Eastern Christianity can hardly be overstated:

### Theological Articulation

He provided the most comprehensive and systematic articulation of Eastern Orthodox positions on several theological issues that distinguished it from Western Christianity, particularly regarding the procession of the Holy Spirit. His well-reasoned arguments established the theological framework that Orthodox theologians would use for centuries.

### Church-State Relations

Photius operated within the Byzantine model of "symphony" between church and state, where the emperor and patriarch each had their distinct but complementary spheres of authority. However, he vigorously defended the church's independence in theological matters, resisting imperial interference in doctrinal issues.

### Missionary Vision

Despite his conflicts with Rome over missionary jurisdiction, Photius supported and guided the Byzantine mission to the Slavs led by Saints Cyril and Methodius. His approval of translating Scripture and liturgy into Slavonic contradicted the "trilingual heresy" (the notion that Christian worship could only be conducted in Hebrew, Greek, or Latin) and fostered the indigenization of Christianity among Slavic peoples.

### Preservation of Classical Learning

Photius's scholarly work preserved countless classical and patristic texts during a period when many ancient works were being lost. His critical evaluations demonstrate a sophisticated intellectual approach that valued reason alongside faith. He exemplified the Byzantine commitment to paideia (education in the classical tradition) integrated with Christian theology.

## Historical Assessment and Legacy

Historical assessments of Photius remain divided along denominational lines:

In Eastern Orthodox tradition, Photius is venerated as a saint and titled "the Great" and "Pillar of Orthodoxy." He is remembered as a defender of Eastern ecclesiological independence and theological integrity who resisted inappropriate papal claims of universal jurisdiction.

In Roman Catholic historiography, Photius has traditionally been viewed more critically as an instigator of division whose ambition contributed to the growing estrangement between East and West. However, modern Catholic scholarship has become more nuanced, recognizing his genuine theological concerns and outstanding intellectual contributions.

From a neutral historical perspective, several points are clear:
- Photius was an intellectual giant whose scholarship preserved much of classical and patristic literature
- The conflicts during his patriarchate reflected genuine ecclesiological and theological differences between East and West, not merely personal ambition
- While the "Photian Schism" was technically healed in his lifetime, the issues it raised continued to divide East and West, contributing to the formal Great Schism of 1054

## Character and Personality

Contemporary accounts describe Photius as possessing a formidable intellect combined with considerable diplomatic skill. He could be uncompromising in matters of principle but also demonstrated pragmatism when necessary. His correspondence reveals both warmth toward friends and biting criticism toward theological opponents.

Even his critics acknowledged his vast learning. The papal librarian Anastasius, who opposed Photius ecclesiastically, nonetheless marveled at his erudition, stating: "A man of encyclopedic knowledge... distinguished in secular wisdom and knowledge of Scripture, a man who has all the sciences in his memory and practical mastery."
