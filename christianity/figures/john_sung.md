# John Sung - The Flame of God in China

![John Sung preaching](john_sung_preaching.jpg)

John Sung (Song Shangjie, 1901-1944) was one of the most influential Chinese evangelists of the 20th century, whose brief but explosive ministry transformed Chinese Christianity and left an indelible mark on the Asian church. Often called "The Wesley of China" or "The Flame of God," Sung's passionate preaching, dramatic conversion experience, and powerful revival meetings catalyzed a spiritual awakening that strengthened the Chinese church's foundation before the Communist revolution. His emphasis on personal repentance, Holy Spirit empowerment, and sacrificial discipleship contributed to a form of indigenous Chinese Christianity that could withstand decades of persecution.

## Early Life and Education

Born in Hinghwa (now Putian), Fujian Province, to a Methodist minister, John Sung grew up in a Christian household and showed exceptional intellectual abilities from a young age. His early spiritual experiences included a sense of divine calling at age nine after recovering from a near-fatal illness.

Sung's academic brilliance earned him a scholarship to study in America, where he arrived in 1920. He excelled in his studies, completing his undergraduate education and eventually earning a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Ohio State University in just five years. His dissertation on chemical research was deemed so exceptional that it received special honors, and Sung was offered attractive positions in American academic institutions.

## Conversion and Transformation

While academically successful, Sung experienced an inner spiritual emptiness. The pivotal moment in his life came in February 1927 during a spiritual retreat where he underwent a dramatic conversion experience. For days, he was consumed with conviction of sin, followed by an overwhelming sense of God's grace and forgiveness.

This experience was so intense that college authorities, misinterpreting his behavior, committed him to a mental asylum where he remained for 193 days. During this confinement, Sung read through the Bible forty times, developing the biblical foundation for his future ministry. Upon his release, he rejected his scientific credentials (reportedly throwing his Ph.D. diploma into the ocean during his return voyage to China) to focus entirely on evangelistic work.

## Ministry and Impact

### Revival Preaching

From 1928 to 1939, Sung conducted revival meetings throughout China and Southeast Asia, sometimes preaching five times a day to crowds numbering in the thousands. His preaching style was characterized by:

- Direct, vivid language accessible to ordinary people
- Dramatic demonstrations and object lessons
- Fearless confrontation of sin
- Emphasis on the cross and blood of Christ
- Calls for immediate repentance

Unlike many missionaries and Chinese pastors of his era, Sung preached in vernacular Chinese rather than classical styles, making his message accessible to all education levels.

### Evangelistic Campaigns

Sung's ministry was primarily itinerant, traveling extensively across China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Myanmar. His evangelistic campaigns typically lasted 1-2 weeks in each location and followed a pattern:

1. Preaching on sin and repentance
2. Teaching on salvation and sanctification
3. Healing services and prayer for the sick
4. Formation of "evangelistic teams" to continue the work

During his brief 15-year ministry, Sung is estimated to have:
- Preached to over 1.5 million people
- Led approximately 100,000 people to Christian conversion
- Established hundreds of "evangelistic teams" that continued sharing the gospel
- Traveled over 125,000 miles (before modern transportation)

### Healing Ministry

While emphasizing spiritual conversion above physical healing, Sung also conducted healing services where numerous miraculous healings were reported. Unlike many faith healers, he maintained that spiritual healing from sin was more important than physical healing, yet his ministry to the sick brought many to faith.

## Theological Emphasis

John Sung's theology was characterized by:

- **Biblical Literalism**: Unwavering belief in the authority and literal truth of scripture
- **Christocentrism**: Intense focus on Christ's atoning sacrifice
- **Experiential Faith**: Emphasis on personal encounter with God
- **Holy Spirit Power**: Recognition of the Spirit's work in conversion and sanctification
- **Indigenous Christianity**: Adaptation of Christian message to Chinese cultural context
- **Separation**: Call for believers to maintain purity and distinction from worldly influences

While educated in modernist theological environments, Sung rejected theological liberalism and embraced a fundamentalist, experiential Christianity that resonated deeply with Chinese people.

## Personal Life and Character

Sung married Yu Jinhua in 1927 and had five children. Despite his busy ministry schedule, he maintained a disciplined personal life with hours devoted to prayer and Bible study each day. Known for his peculiar habits and appearance—often wearing simple Chinese gowns and carrying a clock to time his sermons—Sung lived simply despite opportunities for wealth.

His ministry was marked by personal sacrifice, including separation from family for long periods and declining health due to intestinal issues that eventually led to his death at 43. Throughout his illness, he continued to counsel visitors and write devotional materials.

## Legacy and Influence

Sung's impact on Asian Christianity has been profound and enduring:

- His emphasis on indigenous leadership strengthened the Chinese church to withstand Communist persecution
- Many church leaders throughout Asia trace their spiritual lineage to his ministry
- His model of revival-oriented evangelism influenced Chinese church growth patterns
- His journals and writings continue to inspire Chinese Christians worldwide
- The "evangelistic teams" he established became the foundation for many local churches
- His ministry demonstrated the power of contextualized, Spirit-filled Christianity

When Sung died in 1944, the Chinese church was on the verge of its most challenging period under Communist rule. The spiritual foundation he helped establish contributed significantly to the remarkable resilience and growth of Chinese Christianity during decades of persecution.

## Historical Significance

John Sung's ministry occurred during a pivotal period in Chinese history:

- Between the fall of imperial China and the rise of Communist China
- During Japanese invasion and occupation
- Amid growing Chinese nationalism and identity formation
- When Western missionary influence was beginning to decline

In this context, Sung represented a truly indigenous Chinese Christianity that was not dependent on Western structures or leadership, helping the church develop its own identity separate from colonial associations.
