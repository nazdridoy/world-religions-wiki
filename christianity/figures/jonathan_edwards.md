# Jonathan Edwards - Puritan Theologian and Great Awakening Preacher

![Jonathan Edwards](jonathan_edwards.jpg)

Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) was America's most significant early theologian, philosopher, and revivalist preacher. As a key figure in the First Great Awakening, Edwards combined profound intellectual depth with spiritual intensity, producing theological works that continue to influence Christian thought centuries later. His preaching helped spark religious revival across colonial America, while his philosophical writings engaged with Enlightenment thought from a distinctly Reformed perspective. Though often remembered for his vivid sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God," Edwards' broader legacy encompasses a rich theology of beauty, affection, and divine sovereignty that has shaped American religious life and Reformed theology worldwide.

## Early Life and Education

Jonathan Edwards was born into a prominent New England family with deep religious roots. His father, Timothy Edwards, was a respected pastor, and his maternal grandfather was Solomon Stoddard, the influential minister whom Jonathan would eventually succeed in Northampton.

Edwards showed remarkable intellectual precocity from childhood:
- At age 10, he wrote a scientific essay on the flying spider
- At 13, he entered Yale College, graduating as valedictorian
- At 14, he read Locke's *Essay Concerning Human Understanding*, which profoundly influenced his thought
- At 17, he experienced a religious conversion that shaped his subsequent life and theology

After completing his Master of Arts degree at Yale, Edwards briefly served as pastor of a Presbyterian church in New York before returning to Yale as a tutor. In 1727, he was ordained as the assistant pastor to his grandfather in Northampton, Massachusetts, becoming the sole minister two years later upon Stoddard's death.

## Theological Contributions

Edwards developed a comprehensive theological system that engaged with Enlightenment thought while maintaining Reformed orthodoxy:

### Reformed Theology Reframed

Edwards defended traditional Calvinist doctrines with innovative arguments:

- **Divine Sovereignty**: Edwards articulated God's absolute sovereignty in salvation while emphasizing human responsibility
- **Predestination**: He developed sophisticated philosophical arguments for predestination against Arminian alternatives
- **Original Sin**: He defended the doctrine of original sin using both biblical exegesis and philosophical reasoning about moral agency

### Religious Epistemology

Edwards developed a distinctive approach to religious knowledge:

- He distinguished between "notional" understanding and experiential knowledge of divine things
- He argued that true spiritual knowledge involves both intellect and affections
- He proposed that regeneration gives the believer a new "sense" to perceive divine beauty
- He maintained that authentic religious experience produces visible moral transformation

### Theology of Beauty and Affections

Perhaps Edwards' most distinctive contribution was his theology of beauty and affections:

- God's beauty (or "excellency") is the foundation of all other beauty
- True virtue consists in "benevolence to Being in general" (love for God and all creation)
- Religious affections (not mere emotions but deep inclinations of the soul) are central to authentic faith
- The highest form of religious experience is a disinterested delight in God's beauty for its own sake

### Philosophical Theology

Edwards engaged deeply with Enlightenment philosophy:

- He developed a sophisticated idealist metaphysics influenced by Locke, Berkeley, and Malebranche
- He articulated a compatibilist view of free will that distinguished between natural ability and moral inability
- He proposed that God continuously creates the world at each moment (continuous creation)
- He defended the rationality of Christian faith against deist critiques

## Revival Ministry

Edwards is best known for his role in the religious revival known as the First Great Awakening:

### The Northampton Revival

In 1734-35, Edwards' congregation in Northampton experienced a remarkable religious awakening:

- Hundreds were converted in a town of only 1,100 people
- The revival spread to neighboring communities throughout the Connecticut River Valley
- Edwards documented this revival in *A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God*, which became influential throughout the American colonies and Britain

### The Great Awakening

When George Whitefield's preaching tour sparked a broader revival across the colonies in 1740-42, Edwards became both a participant and its most thoughtful interpreter:

- His sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" (delivered in Enfield, Connecticut in 1741) became the most famous sermon in American history
- He defended the revival against critics who dismissed it as mere emotionalism
- He also cautioned against excesses and developed criteria for distinguishing genuine from counterfeit religious experiences
- His work *Religious Affections* (1746) emerged from this period as a classic of spiritual discernment

### Revival Theology

Edwards developed a distinctive theology of revival:

- Revivals are sovereign works of God rather than merely human productions
- They represent concentrated periods of the Spirit's ordinary work of conversion
- They often involve unusual physical and emotional manifestations, which should be neither rejected outright nor uncritically embraced
- They must ultimately be judged by their lasting moral and spiritual fruits

## Controversies and Challenges

Despite his intellectual and spiritual achievements, Edwards faced significant controversies:

### The "Bad Book" Incident

In 1744, Edwards discovered that young people in his congregation were sharing an obstetrics manual with inappropriate comments. His public handling of the matter created tension with prominent families.

### The Communion Controversy

Edwards reversed his grandfather's policy of allowing the unconverted to receive communion (the "Half-Way Covenant"), insisting that only those with a credible profession of faith could participate. This led to his dismissal from the Northampton church in 1750 after 23 years of ministry.

### Missionary Period

After his dismissal, Edwards accepted a position as missionary to the Housatonic Indians at Stockbridge, Massachusetts. During this period of reduced pastoral responsibilities, he wrote his most important philosophical works, including *Freedom of the Will* and *Original Sin*.

## Legacy and Influence

Edwards' influence extends far beyond his own lifetime:

### Theological Impact

- He is widely regarded as America's greatest theologian
- His works have been particularly influential in Reformed and evangelical circles
- His theology of religious experience influenced American revivalism from the Second Great Awakening through Billy Graham
- His philosophical theology has experienced a significant revival of interest since the late 20th century

### Literary Significance

- Edwards is recognized as one of America's first great prose stylists
- His sermons exemplify the best of the Puritan "plain style" while incorporating vivid imagery
- His personal writings, especially his "Personal Narrative" and "Resolutions," have influenced spiritual autobiography

### Educational Legacy

- His descendants founded numerous colleges and seminaries
- His emphasis on the integration of faith, reason, and affection has influenced Christian higher education
- His works remain central to the curriculum in many theological institutions

### Contemporary Relevance

- His theology of beauty offers resources for contemporary aesthetics
- His understanding of religious experience provides a framework for evaluating modern spirituality
- His engagement with Enlightenment thought offers a model for Christian intellectual engagement
- His emphasis on affections challenges both cold orthodoxy and anti-intellectual emotionalism

## Personal Life

Edwards married Sarah Pierpont in 1727, forming a remarkable partnership. Their marriage produced eleven children and was characterized by deep mutual affection and shared spiritual vision. Sarah managed the household during Edwards' frequent study retreats and supported his ministry throughout its challenges.

Edwards maintained an intense devotional life alongside his intellectual pursuits:
- He spent 13 hours daily in his study
- He regularly practiced spiritual disciplines including prayer, fasting, and solitary walks in nature
- He kept detailed notebooks of his spiritual insights and experiences
- He wrote and revisited a set of personal "Resolutions" to guide his conduct

Edwards died unexpectedly from a smallpox inoculation shortly after assuming the presidency of the College of New Jersey (Princeton) in 1758.
