# Stephen - The First Christian Martyr

![Stephen](../images/figures/stephen.jpg)

Stephen stands as a pivotal figure in early Christianity as the first person to die for his faith in Jesus Christ. Described in the Acts of the Apostles as a man "full of faith and of the Holy Spirit," he served as one of the seven deacons appointed to address practical needs in the early Jerusalem church. His powerful preaching, courageous testimony before the Sanhedrin, and dramatic martyrdom established a pattern of Christian witness that would inspire countless followers throughout history. Stephen's death also marked a crucial turning point for the early church, catalyzing the spread of Christianity beyond Jerusalem.

## Biblical Account

Stephen appears exclusively in the Book of Acts, where his ministry, trial, and martyrdom are recounted in chapters 6-8.

### Selection as Deacon

The first Christians in Jerusalem faced an internal challenge when Greek-speaking Jewish converts (Hellenists) complained that their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. The apostles proposed a solution:

>"It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables. Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word." (Acts 6:2-4)

The community selected seven men, including Stephen, described as "a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 6:5). These seven became the first deacons, appointed to oversee practical matters within the church community.

### Ministry and Signs

Stephen's service extended beyond administrative duties:

>"Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people." (Acts 6:8)

His effective ministry and powerful preaching drew opposition from several Hellenistic synagogues in Jerusalem. When they could not defeat him in debate, Stephen's opponents resorted to false accusations:

>"They secretly persuaded some men to say, 'We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.'" (Acts 6:11)

### Trial Before the Sanhedrin

These charges led to Stephen's arrest and appearance before the Sanhedrin, the Jewish religious council. There, false witnesses claimed:

>"This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law. For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us." (Acts 6:13-14)

In response, rather than directly defending himself, Stephen delivered a lengthy speech (Acts 7:2-53) that traced God's relationship with Israel throughout history. He emphasized how:

1. God revealed himself and worked outside the land of Israel (with Abraham in Mesopotamia, Joseph in Egypt, Moses in Midian)
2. The Israelites repeatedly rejected God's appointed leaders (Joseph, Moses)
3. The temple, while significant, was not meant to limit God's presence

Stephen concluded with a direct accusation against the religious leaders:

>"You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him." (Acts 7:51-52)

### Martyrdom

The response to Stephen's speech was immediate and violent:

>"When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 'Look,' he said, 'I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.'

>At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city and began to stone him... While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.' Then he fell on his knees and cried out, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them.' When he had said this, he fell asleep." (Acts 7:54-58, 59-60)

The account notes that the witnesses "laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul" (Acts. 7:58), who would later become the apostle Paul.

## Historical Context

Several historical factors shed light on Stephen's ministry and death:

### Hellenistic Judaism

Stephen was likely a Hellenistic Jewâ€”a Greek-speaking Jew influenced by Greek culture, but committed to Jewish faith. Tensions between Hellenistic and Hebrew-speaking Jews existed within both Judaism and the early church.

### The Seven Deacons

All seven deacons appointed in Acts 6 have Greek names, suggesting they were chosen specifically to address concerns in the Hellenistic Jewish-Christian community.

### Legal Authority

The precise legal status of Stephen's execution is unclear. While the Roman authorities generally retained the right to capital punishment, there are recorded instances of crowd violence and unofficial executions, particularly in religiously charged situations.

### Diaspora Influence

Stephen's speech shows familiarity with diaspora Jewish interpretations of scripture and may reflect theological perspectives that had developed among Jews living outside Palestine.

## Theological Significance

Stephen's life, ministry, and death hold profound theological significance for Christianity:

### Pneumatology (Doctrine of the Holy Spirit)

Stephen is repeatedly described as being "full of the Holy Spirit," demonstrating the early church's understanding that the Spirit:
- Empowered ordinary believers for ministry
- Provided wisdom for practical church leadership
- Enabled courage in the face of persecution
- Granted supernatural visions at critical moments

### Christology

Stephen's vision of "the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God" affirms:
- Jesus's divine status and heavenly exaltation
- Christ's active involvement with his followers during persecution
- The fulfillment of Jesus's own predictions about his ascension

### Ecclesiology (Church Structure)

The appointment of the seven deacons represents:
- The early church's practical adaptation to growth and needs
- The establishment of specialized ministry roles
- A model for servant leadership within the Christian community

### Eschatology

Stephen's martyrdom contributed to Christian understanding of:
- Death as "falling asleep" for believers
- The immediate reception of the believer's spirit by Christ
- The importance of final perseverance in faith

## Legacy and Influence

Stephen's witness and martyrdom had far-reaching consequences:

### Catalyst for Church Expansion

Acts 8:1 records that following Stephen's death, "a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria." This dispersion fulfilled Jesus's commission in Acts 1:8 and spread Christianity beyond Jerusalem.

### Influence on Paul

Saul (later Paul) witnessed Stephen's execution and may have been influenced by:
- Stephen's powerful spiritual example
- His theological understanding of salvation history
- His forgiveness of his killers
- His vision of the exalted Christ

Some scholars suggest that elements of Stephen's speech may have shaped Paul's later theological perspectives.

### Model for Christian Martyrdom

Stephen established a pattern for Christian martyrdom that would be followed by countless others, characterized by:
- Boldness in proclaiming truth
- Supernatural peace and vision during suffering
- Forgiveness of persecutors
- Commitment to Christ even unto death

### Liturgical Commemoration

Stephen is commemorated in various Christian traditions:
- **Western Christianity**: Feast day on December 26
- **Eastern Christianity**: Feast day on December 27
- **Oriental Orthodox Churches**: Additional commemorations throughout the year
