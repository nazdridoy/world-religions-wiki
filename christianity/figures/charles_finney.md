# Charles Finney - Father of Modern Revivalism

![Charles Finney](charles_finney.jpg)

Charles Grandison Finney (1792-1875) was one of the most influential American religious figures of the 19th century, whose innovative revival methods transformed American evangelicalism and whose theology emphasized human moral agency and social reform. As the leading figure of the Second Great Awakening, Finney pioneered techniques that made conversion a deliberate, immediate choice rather than a gradual process. His ministry led to mass conversions across the northeastern United States, sparked significant social reform movements, and established patterns of evangelism that continue to shape American religious practice. Finney's pragmatic approach to revival, emphasis on human free will, and integration of social reform with evangelism created a distinctly American form of Christianity that remains influential in evangelical circles worldwide.

## Early Life and Conversion

Born in rural Connecticut and raised in western New York's "burned-over district" (so named for its frequent religious revivals), Finney initially pursued a career in law. His dramatic conversion experience in 1821 set the pattern for his future ministry:

After struggling with religious questions for several days, Finney experienced what he described as a profound encounter with God in his law office in Adams, New York. He wrote in his memoirs:

"The Holy Spirit descended upon me in a manner that seemed to go through me, body and soul... like waves of liquid love... No words can express the wonderful love that was shed abroad in my heart."

Key aspects of his conversion shaped his later theology:
- It was sudden and dramatic rather than gradual
- It involved an immediate, conscious decision
- It produced immediate, visible results in his behavior
- It was understood as a direct encounter with the Holy Spirit

The day after his conversion, Finney announced to a client: "I have a retainer from the Lord Jesus Christ to plead his cause, and I cannot plead yours." He abandoned his legal career and began preparing for ministry.

## Revival Ministry and "New Measures"

After brief, informal theological training, Finney was licensed to preach by the Presbyterian Church in 1824. He quickly developed innovative revival methods that broke with traditional Calvinist approaches:

### The "New Measures"

Finney's controversial revival techniques included:

1. **Direct, colloquial preaching**: Abandoning formal theological language for plain speech directed at ordinary people
2. **The "anxious bench"**: Calling potential converts to sit in a front bench to receive special prayer and attention
3. **Protracted meetings**: Extending revival services over many days or weeks
4. **Public prayer for individuals by name**: Directly naming "sinners" during public prayers
5. **Allowing women to pray in mixed public gatherings**: Breaking with conventional restrictions on women's roles
6. **Immediate admission to church membership**: Not requiring extended periods of instruction before church membership

These methods were designed to create an immediate decision for Christ rather than waiting for God's sovereign timing. Finney justified them pragmatically: "The results justify my methods."

### Major Revivals

Finney's most significant revivals occurred between 1824 and 1835:

- **Western New York (1824-1832)**: His revivals in Rome, Utica, Auburn, and Rochester transformed entire communities
- **Eastern Cities (1827-1832)**: Successful campaigns in Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston established his national reputation
- **Rochester Revival (1830-1831)**: Perhaps his most famous revival, where an estimated 100,000 people were converted across the region

The Rochester revival demonstrated Finney's mature revival system and its social impact. Businesses closed during prayer meetings, taverns were converted into prayer rooms, and the character of the city was reportedly transformed. This revival became the model for his influential *Lectures on Revivals of Religion*.

## Theological Innovations

Finney's theology represented a significant departure from the Calvinist orthodoxy of his day:

### Moral Government Theology

Central to Finney's thought was his "moral government" framework:

- God governs the moral universe through natural laws similar to physical laws
- Sin is a voluntary transgression of known law
- Humans possess complete free will and moral ability
- Conversion is a change of ultimate intention from selfishness to benevolence
- Salvation requires complete moral reformation, not just forgiveness

### Rejection of Original Sin

Finney rejected the traditional doctrine of original sin:

- Humans are not born with a sinful nature inherited from Adam
- Sin consists only in voluntary acts, not an inherited condition
- Moral character cannot be transmitted from one person to another
- Each person is capable of obeying God without supernatural transformation of nature

### Doctrine of Perfectionism

Finney taught that Christians could achieve "entire sanctification" in this life:

- Perfect obedience to God's moral law is possible
- Christians should expect and seek complete victory over sin
- Sanctification, like conversion, comes through a decisive act of will
- The Holy Spirit enables but does not override human choice

### Pragmatic Approach to Doctrine

Finney evaluated theological positions by their practical effects:

- Doctrines that discouraged evangelistic effort were rejected
- Theological systems were judged by their ability to produce conversions
- The success of a method was seen as evidence of divine approval
- Biblical interpretation was guided by "common sense" rather than tradition

## Social Reform Activism

Finney insisted that genuine conversion must produce social action. His ministry catalyzed several reform movements:

### Abolitionism

Finney was a committed abolitionist:

- He refused communion to slaveholders at Broadway Tabernacle
- Oberlin College under his leadership became a center of abolitionist activity
- Many of his converts became leaders in the abolitionist movement
- He supported the Underground Railroad and advocated immediate emancipation

### Temperance Movement

Finney viewed alcohol as a major social evil:

- He required temperance pledges from converts
- His revivals often led to the closure of distilleries and taverns
- He saw temperance as a necessary component of Christian character

### Educational Reform

At Oberlin College, Finney implemented progressive educational ideas:

- Oberlin was the first American college to regularly admit women and African Americans
- The curriculum combined classical education with practical training
- Education was seen as preparation for Christian service and social reform

## Legacy and Influence

Finney's influence on American Christianity has been profound and enduring:

### Impact on American Evangelicalism

- Shifted evangelical theology toward Arminian emphasis on human free will
- Established the revival meeting as a central evangelical institution
- Developed techniques still used in modern evangelistic campaigns
- Helped create a distinctively American form of Christianity

### Educational Legacy

- Transformed Oberlin into a leading progressive institution
- Trained a generation of ministers, educators, and reformers
- Established a model of Christian higher education that integrated faith and social concern

### Social Reform Impact

- Connected evangelical piety with social reform
- Provided theological justification for Christian political engagement
- Influenced later movements from Prohibition to the modern Religious Right

### Global Influence

- His revival methods were adopted internationally
- His books, especially *Lectures on Revivals*, influenced evangelists worldwide
- His emphasis on immediate conversion shaped global evangelicalism

## Controversies and Criticisms

Finney's ministry and theology generated significant controversy:

### Theological Objections

Traditional Calvinists strongly opposed Finney's innovations:

- Princeton theologians like Charles Hodge accused him of Pelagianism (denying human depravity)
- Critics claimed he reduced conversion to human psychology rather than divine action
- His rejection of imputed sin and righteousness was seen as abandoning core Reformation doctrine
- His perfectionism was criticized as promoting spiritual pride

### Methodological Criticisms

Finney's "new measures" faced opposition even from fellow revivalists:

- Some saw his techniques as manipulative and focused on emotional excitement
- Critics argued that quick conversions led to shallow faith
- His pragmatic approach was seen as compromising theological integrity

### Historical Assessment

Modern historians and theologians remain divided on Finney's legacy:

- Some see him as having accommodated Christianity to American individualism
- Others credit him with revitalizing American Christianity at a crucial moment
- His connection of evangelism and social reform offers a model beyond the modern evangelical/liberal divide
- His emphasis on human agency continues to influence debates about conversion and sanctification

## Personal Life

Finney married three times, as two of his wives preceded him in death:
- Lydia Root Andrews (m. 1824, d. 1847) - supported his early ministry and raised their six children
- Elizabeth Ford Atkinson (m. 1848, d. 1863) - assisted in his work at Oberlin
- Rebecca Allen Rayl (m. 1865) - companioned him in his final decade

Despite his public role, Finney maintained a disciplined devotional life:
- He rose early for extended prayer
- He often fasted during revival campaigns
- He reported ongoing mystical experiences throughout his life

In his later years, Finney focused on teaching at Oberlin while continuing to lead revivals during vacations. He remained active in ministry until shortly before his death in 1875.
