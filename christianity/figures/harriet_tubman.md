## Religious Experiences and Mystical Faith

Tubman's Christianity was characterized by direct mystical experiences:

### Visions and Dreams

- Experienced vivid dreams and visions she understood as divine communication
- Reported seeing angelic figures and receiving specific guidance about routes, dangers, and timing

## Escape and Liberation Work

In 1849, Tubman escaped from slavery, an experience she always framed in religious terms:

- Later described her crossing into Pennsylvania: "When I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person. There was such a glory over everything... I felt like I was in Heaven."
- Returned approximately 13 times to slave territory to lead others to freedom
- Never lost a "passenger" on the Underground Railroad, which she attributed to divine protection
