# George Whitefield - Grand Itinerant of the Great Awakening

![George Whitefield](george_whitefield.jpg)

George Whitefield (1714-1770) was one of the most influential evangelists of the 18th century and a central figure in the transatlantic religious revival known as the Great Awakening. His dramatic preaching style, theological emphasis on the "new birth," and innovative open-air evangelism transformed the religious landscape of colonial America and Britain. Crossing denominational, social, and racial boundaries, Whitefield pioneered modern evangelistic methods while maintaining Calvinist theological convictions. His extraordinary oratorical gifts, tireless itinerant ministry, and skillful use of emerging media made him arguably the first international celebrity preacher, whose influence on evangelical Christianity continues to the present day.

## Early Life and Conversion

George Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, where his parents operated the Bell Inn. His father died when George was two, leaving his mother to run the inn while raising seven children. Young George occasionally worked as a servant at the inn, developing social skills that would later serve his ministry.

Despite financial limitations, Whitefield secured education at the prestigious Crypt School in Gloucester. He demonstrated early oratorical talent through his love of theater and public speaking, though he later renounced theatrical performances as spiritually harmful.

In 1732, Whitefield entered Pembroke College, Oxford, as a servitor (working his way through college by serving wealthier students). There he joined the "Holy Club," a small group of methodical religious students led by John and Charles Wesley. Though devout, Whitefield experienced intense spiritual struggle until his conversion in 1735:

"God was pleased to remove the heavy load, to enable me to lay hold on His dear Son by a living faith, and by giving me the Spirit of adoption, to seal me, as I humbly hope, even to the day of everlasting redemption."

This dramatic conversion experience of the "new birth" became the centerpiece of Whitefield's subsequent preaching.

## Early Ministry and Innovation

Ordained as a deacon in the Church of England in 1736, Whitefield quickly demonstrated extraordinary preaching gifts. His first sermon at Gloucester Cathedral reportedly "drove fifteen people mad" with concern for their souls. From the beginning, his preaching style was marked by:

- Dramatic delivery drawing on his theatrical background
- Vivid imagery and accessible language
- Emotional appeals alongside doctrinal content
- Emphasis on personal conversion rather than ritual observance

After brief missionary service in Georgia in 1738, Whitefield returned to England to be ordained as a priest and raise funds for an orphanage. Finding many churches closed to him due to his unconventional style and message, he made a pivotal innovation in 1739 by taking his preaching outdoors.

### Open-Air Preaching Revolution

Whitefield's first major open-air sermon occurred in February 1739 near Bristol, where he preached to coal miners. This revolutionary approach:

- Circumvented institutional control of pulpits
- Reached those who never attended church
- Allowed for vastly larger audiences (often 10,000-30,000 people)
- Created a more democratic religious environment

His success in field preaching soon inspired John Wesley to adopt the same approach, though Wesley was initially reluctant to preach outside church buildings.

## The Great Awakening

Between 1739 and 1770, Whitefield made seven evangelistic tours of the American colonies, becoming the human catalyst for the series of revivals known as the First Great Awakening. His impact was unprecedented:

### Colonial Impact

- He preached from Georgia to Maine, in every major colonial city
- He attracted the largest crowds ever assembled in colonial America
- He transcended denominational boundaries, preaching in any available venue
- He fostered intercolonial consciousness before American political identity formed

### Innovative Methods

Whitefield pioneered modern evangelistic techniques:

- **Advance Publicity**: He sent publicity ahead to cities he would visit
- **Media Engagement**: He cultivated relationships with newspaper publishers like Benjamin Franklin
- **Published Journals**: His journals and letters were bestsellers on both sides of the Atlantic
- **Merchandising**: His image appeared on commonly sold items (early "celebrity" marketing)
- **Interdenominational Cooperation**: He worked with various Protestant groups

### Theological Emphasis

Whitefield's message centered on several key themes:

- The necessity of the "new birth" (regeneration) through personal conversion
- The insufficiency of mere external religion or moral reformation
- The doctrine of justification by faith alone
- The sovereignty of God in salvation (Calvinistic emphasis)

## Theological Positions and Controversies

Though ordained in the Church of England, Whitefield's theology and practice generated significant controversy:

### Calvinistic Methodism

Whitefield's embrace of Calvinist predestination led to a painful split with John Wesley, who held Arminian views emphasizing human free will in salvation. This theological difference created two streams within the early Methodist movement:

- The larger Wesleyan branch (Arminian)
- The smaller Calvinistic Methodist branch led by Whitefield and the Countess of Huntingdon

Despite their theological differences, Whitefield and Wesley maintained respectful relations. Whitefield even requested that Wesley preach his funeral sermon, though Wesley outlived him by many years.

### Anglican Tensions

Though he remained an Anglican priest throughout his life, Whitefield's relationship with the established church was strained:

- Many Anglican clergy criticized his emotional preaching style
- His crossing of parish boundaries violated church protocol
- His association with dissenters (non-Anglican Protestants) raised suspicions
- His emphasis on personal conversion seemed to undermine institutional authority

### Colonial Religious Politics

In America, Whitefield's ministry generated both revival and division:

- The "Old Lights" (traditional clergy) opposed his emotional methods and criticized the disorder of revival meetings
- The "New Lights" embraced his emphasis on conversion experience and spiritual vitality
- This division contributed to denominational realignments in American Protestantism

## Social Impact and Reform

While primarily focused on evangelism, Whitefield's ministry had significant social dimensions:

### Orphanage Work

In 1740, Whitefield founded the Bethesda Orphanage near Savannah, Georgia:

- It was the first major charitable institution in the colony
- It combined humanitarian care with educational and spiritual formation
- It remained Whitefield's most enduring institutional legacy
- It required constant fundraising throughout his ministry

### Class and Race

Whitefield's ministry crossed significant social boundaries:

- He preached to aristocrats and coal miners with equal fervor
- He criticized slave owners for neglecting slaves' spiritual welfare
- He advocated for slaves' religious instruction and baptism
- Yet he also advocated for the legalization of slavery in Georgia and owned slaves himself at the orphanage

This complex position on slavery—condemning its abuses while accepting the institution itself—reflects the limitations of his social vision despite his broader humanitarian concerns.

## Preaching Style and Impact

Whitefield's oratorical gifts were legendary. Benjamin Franklin, initially skeptical, became an admirer after hearing Whitefield preach in Philadelphia. Franklin wrote that Whitefield's voice could be heard clearly by 30,000 people in the open air (though this estimate may be exaggerated).

### Delivery Characteristics

- Extraordinary vocal projection and control
- Dramatic gestures and facial expressions
- Strategic use of pauses and emphasis
- Ability to move seamlessly between terror and tenderness

### Content and Structure

- Vivid imagery and accessible illustrations
- Direct personal application to various listener types
- Christocentric focus regardless of the text
- Balance of doctrinal substance with emotional appeal

Actor David Garrick reportedly said he would give a hundred guineas to be able to say "Oh" as Whitefield did. This theatrical quality made his preaching unforgettable to listeners accustomed to dry, academic sermons.

## Personal Life and Character

Whitefield's personal life was marked by both admirable dedication and human limitations:

### Marriage and Family

In 1741, Whitefield married Elizabeth James, a widow significantly older than himself. Their relationship appears to have been more practical than romantic, as Whitefield believed he needed a wife who understood the demands of itinerant ministry. They had one child who died in infancy. Elizabeth died in 1768, two years before Whitefield's own death.

### Work Ethic and Health

Whitefield maintained an exhausting schedule throughout his ministry:

- He typically preached 40-60 hours per week
- He crossed the Atlantic thirteen times when sea travel was dangerous
- He continued preaching despite developing asthma in his later years
- His tireless pace likely contributed to his relatively early death at age 55

### Character Strengths and Weaknesses

Contemporary accounts and his own journals reveal a complex character:

- **Strengths**: Extraordinary work ethic, courage in the face of opposition, generosity to the poor, ability to work across denominational lines
- **Weaknesses**: Occasional impetuosity, tendency toward controversy, sometimes harsh judgment of opponents, blind spots regarding social issues like slavery

## Death and Legacy

Whitefield died on September 30, 1770, in Newburyport, Massachusetts, after preaching his final sermon despite severe asthma. True to his lifelong pattern, he literally preached until he could no longer stand. He was buried, according to his wishes, under the pulpit of the Presbyterian church in Newburyport, where his tomb can still be visited today.

His legacy continues in several dimensions:

### Evangelical Identity

Whitefield helped establish key characteristics of evangelical Christianity that persist today:

- Emphasis on personal conversion experience
- Innovative communication methods
- Interdenominational cooperation
- Entrepreneurial approach to ministry
- Balance of doctrinal content with emotional appeal

### American Religious Culture

His impact on American religion was particularly significant:

- He helped shift American Protestantism from formal, parish-based religion to a more voluntary, conversion-oriented approach
- He contributed to the democratization of American Christianity by taking religion outside institutional control
- He modeled religious leadership based on charisma and communication skill rather than institutional position
- He fostered intercolonial consciousness that preceded political unity

### Institutional Legacy

Though Whitefield did not found a denomination bearing his name (unlike Wesley), his institutional legacy includes:

- The Bethesda Orphanage (which continued until destroyed by fire in 1773)
- The Calvinistic Methodist connection in Wales
- The Countess of Huntingdon's Connection in England
- Numerous churches throughout Britain and America that were founded or strengthened through his ministry

## Historical Assessment

Historical evaluations of Whitefield have evolved over time:

### Contemporary Views

In his own era, opinions were sharply divided:

- Supporters saw him as a divinely appointed messenger revitalizing Christianity
- Critics viewed him as an enthusiast promoting dangerous emotional excess
- Even critics like Benjamin Franklin acknowledged his sincerity and humanitarian work

### Modern Scholarship

Recent scholarship has produced more nuanced assessments:

- Recognition of his pivotal role in creating modern evangelicalism
- Appreciation of his innovative communication methods
- Critical examination of his positions on social issues, particularly slavery
- Analysis of his contribution to American identity formation
- Study of his role in the commercialization of religion
