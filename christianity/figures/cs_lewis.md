# C.S. Lewis (1898-1963)

![C.S. Lewis](../images/figures/cs_lewis.jpg)

Clive Staples Lewis was a British writer, scholar, and lay theologian who became one of the most influential Christian apologists of the 20th century. Through his academic works, fictional writings, and radio broadcasts, Lewis brought Christian theology to a broad audience in accessible language without sacrificing intellectual rigor. His combination of reason, imagination, and clear prose continues to introduce countless readers to Christian faith while deepening the theological understanding of believers worldwide.

## Early Life and Conversion

Born in Belfast, Ireland, Lewis experienced early tragedy when his mother died from cancer when he was nine years old. This loss, combined with unhappy experiences at boarding school, contributed to Lewis's youthful atheism. After serving in World War I, where he was wounded in the Battle of Arras, Lewis completed his studies at Oxford University with highest honors in Classical Philosophy, Ancient History, and English Literature.

Despite his intellectual gifts, Lewis struggled with profound questions about meaning, suffering, and joy. Through conversations with Christian friends—notably J.R.R. Tolkien and Hugo Dyson—and his own reading, Lewis gradually moved from atheism to theism and finally to Christianity. He described his conversion in his spiritual autobiography *Surprised by Joy* (1955):

>"You must picture me alone in that room at Magdalen, night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet... In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England."

Lewis's conversion would shape the remainder of his life and work, as he became both an academic and one of Christianity's most articulate defenders.

## Academic Career

Lewis spent most of his academic career at Oxford University, where he taught as a Fellow of Magdalen College from 1925 to 1954. His scholarly works included:

- *The Allegory of Love* (1936) - A study of medieval romantic literature
- *English Literature in the Sixteenth Century, Excluding Drama* (1954) - His contribution to the Oxford History of English Literature
- *Studies in Words* (1960) - An examination of semantic change in language
- *The Discarded Image* (1964) - An introduction to medieval and Renaissance cosmology

In 1954, Lewis accepted the Chair of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge University, where he remained until shortly before his death. His academic reputation was based on his scholarly works rather than his Christian writings, though his faith informed his approach to literature.

## Christian Apologetics

Lewis's greatest contribution to Christianity came through his apologetic works, which defended and explained Christian faith to a skeptical modern audience. His major apologetic works include:

- *The Problem of Pain* (1940) - Addressing the theological problem of suffering
- *The Screwtape Letters* (1942) - A satirical exploration of temptation through letters from a senior demon to his nephew
- *Mere Christianity* (1952) - Originally delivered as BBC radio talks during World War II, presenting core Christian beliefs shared across denominations
- *Miracles* (1947) - A philosophical defense of the possibility of supernatural intervention
- *A Grief Observed* (1961) - A personal account of bereavement following his wife's death

Lewis's distinctive approach combined logical argument with analogy and imagination. He aimed to defend what he called "mere Christianity"—the core beliefs shared by all major Christian traditions rather than denominational peculiarities.

## Fiction and Imagination

Lewis believed imagination could communicate truth in ways logic alone could not. His fictional works, while entertaining, contain profound theological themes:

### Narnia Chronicles
His seven-book children's series beginning with *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* (1950) presents Christian themes through fantasy. Aslan the lion serves as a Christ figure who sacrifices himself for a traitor and conquers death through "deeper magic."

### Space Trilogy
This science fiction series (*Out of the Silent Planet*, *Perelandra*, *That Hideous Strength*) explores theological themes including temptation, sin, and redemption against a cosmic backdrop.

### Till We Have Faces
Lewis considered this retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth his most mature fiction work, exploring themes of divine love, jealousy, and spiritual blindness.

Lewis explained his approach to Christian fiction: "I thought I saw how stories of this kind could steal past a certain inhibition which had paralyzed much of my own religion in childhood... Could one not thus steal past those watchful dragons?"

## Theological Contributions

While not a formal theologian, Lewis made significant theological contributions:

1. **Accessible Explanation of Orthodox Belief**: Lewis presented difficult theological concepts in understandable terms without oversimplification
2. **Trilemma Argument**: His famous "Lord, Liar, or Lunatic" argument challenged views of Jesus as merely a good moral teacher
3. **Argument from Desire**: Lewis suggested that innate human longing for something beyond this world pointed to a transcendent reality
4. **Integration of Reason and Imagination**: He demonstrated how both logical argument and imaginative vision serve theological understanding
5. **Ecumenical Vision**: His concept of "mere Christianity" emphasized core beliefs shared across denominational boundaries

## Personal Life and Legacy

Lewis's personal life included his long friendship with fellow Inkling J.R.R. Tolkien, his care for Mrs. Moore (the mother of his wartime friend Paddy Moore), and his late-life marriage to American writer Joy Davidman, who died of cancer in 1960. His grief over her death, documented in *A Grief Observed*, represents some of his most personal and moving writing.

Lewis died on November 22, 1963—the same day as President John F. Kennedy—but his influence has only grown since his death. His books sell millions of copies annually, and adaptations of his works reach even larger audiences. Annual surveys consistently rank him among the most influential Christian writers, particularly among evangelicals, though his appeal extends across denominational lines. The clarity, imagination, and honesty of his writing continue to make him Christianity's most accessible apologist.
