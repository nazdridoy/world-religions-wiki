# Rudolf Bultmann - New Testament Scholar and Theological Interpreter

![Rudolf Bultmann](rudolf_bultmann.jpg)

Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976) was one of the 20th century's most influential biblical scholars and theologians whose work fundamentally transformed New Testament studies and Christian theology. As the principal architect of "demythologization," Bultmann sought to reinterpret the mythological elements of the New Testament to make its existential message meaningful for modern people shaped by scientific worldviews. His synthesis of historical-critical biblical scholarship with existentialist philosophy offered a radical reappraisal of early Christianity that continues to provoke both fierce criticism and fervent appreciation. Despite the controversy surrounding his work, Bultmann's legacy as a meticulous scholar, passionate teacher, and committed Lutheran who sought to preserve the essence of Christian faith for a modern age remains a towering landmark in theological thought.

## Biographical Development

### Early Life and Education

Born in Wiefelstede, Germany, Bultmann was raised in a Lutheran pastor's home, absorbing both the pietistic faith of his family and the rigorous academic tradition of German Protestantism. He studied theology at the universities of Tübingen, Berlin, and Marburg, learning from key figures in liberal Protestant scholarship including Adolf von Harnack and Johannes Weiss.

His intellectual formation occurred during a transformative period in German theological education when historical-critical approaches to the Bible were becoming standard and the "history of religions" school (Religionsgeschichtliche Schule) was reimagining early Christianity within its broader religious context.

### Academic Career and Influence

After brief teaching positions in Breslau and Giessen, Bultmann took up his career-defining post at the University of Marburg in 1921, where he would remain until his retirement in 1951. At Marburg, his intellectual development was profoundly shaped by his colleague and friend, the philosopher Martin Heidegger, whose existentialist philosophy would provide Bultmann with critical analytical tools.

Despite pressure from the Nazi regime, Bultmann remained in Germany throughout World War II, associating himself with the Confessing Church that opposed Hitler's attempts to control German Protestantism. His 1941 essay "New Testament and Mythology" was published during this period and laid out his program of demythologization.

After the war, Bultmann's influence expanded globally through his students (including notable figures like Ernst Käsemann, Günther Bornkamm, and Hans Conzelmann) and through translations of his works. He lectured widely in the United States and Europe, becoming one of the most discussed—and controversial—theologians of the mid-20th century.

## Major Scholarly Contributions

### Form Criticism

Bultmann was a pioneer of form criticism (Formgeschichte), a method that analyzes the pre-literary oral traditions behind the Gospels:

- **Oral Traditions**: Identified various forms (miracle stories, pronouncement stories, parables) that circulated orally
- **Sitz im Leben**: Traced how these forms were shaped by their "setting in life" within the early church
- **Community Creation**: Argued that much Gospel material reflects the needs and situations of early Christian communities rather than historical accounts of Jesus
- **The History of the Synoptic Tradition** (1921): His groundbreaking application of form criticism to the Synoptic Gospels

Through this work, Bultmann concluded that very little reliable historical information about Jesus could be recovered from the Gospels, which he saw primarily as proclamation (kerygma) rather than biography.

### Johannine Studies

Bultmann's commentary on the Gospel of John (1941) remains a landmark in New Testament scholarship:

- **Gnostic Background**: Argued that John draws on Gnostic language and concepts
- **Redaction Analysis**: Identified multiple sources and editorial layers
- **Theological Interpretation**: Emphasized John's existential message over historical reporting
- **Distinctive Voice**: Recognized John's unique theological perspective compared to the Synoptic Gospels

### Pauline Interpretation

Bultmann's existentialist reading of Paul transformed understanding of Pauline theology:

- **Anthropological Focus**: Emphasized Paul's understanding of human existence
- **Faith as Decision**: Interpreted Pauline faith as existential decision rather than intellectual assent
- **Freedom from Law**: Reinterpreted Paul's critique of law in existentialist terms
- **Authentic Existence**: Connected Pauline concepts of sin and grace to authentic/inauthentic existence

## Demythologization Program

### The Problem of Mythology

Bultmann's most controversial contribution was his program of demythologization, articulated in his 1941 essay "New Testament and Mythology":

- **Mythological Worldview**: Identified the New Testament's three-tiered cosmology (heaven above, earth, underworld below), supernatural interventions, and apocalyptic framework as mythology
- **Modern Impossibility**: Argued that modern people shaped by scientific thinking cannot meaningfully believe in such mythology
- **Existential Interpretation**: Proposed reinterpreting mythological elements to uncover their existential meaning
- **Kerygmatic Core**: Sought to preserve the essential Christian message while abandoning its mythological expression

### Method of Existential Interpretation

Drawing on Heidegger's philosophy, Bultmann developed an existentialist hermeneutic:

- **Self-Understanding**: Biblical texts reveal possibilities for authentic human existence
- **Decision**: The core of Christian faith is decision rather than intellectual assent to propositions
- **Encounter**: God meets humans in the moment of existential decision
- **Authentic Existence**: Salvation reinterpreted as movement from inauthentic to authentic existence

### The Historical Jesus and the Christ of Faith

Bultmann drew a sharp distinction between:

- **Jesus of History**: Largely irrecoverable through historical methods
- **Christ of Faith**: The risen Christ proclaimed in the kerygma
- **The "That"**: What matters is that Jesus existed, not the biographical details of his life
- **Eschatological Event**: Jesus's significance lies in being the eschatological event in which God acts decisively

## Theological System

### Dialectical Theology

Bultmann associated with the "dialectical theology" movement alongside Karl Barth, though their paths diverged significantly:

- **Crisis Theology**: Emphasized the radical otherness of God and crisis of human existence
- **Word of God**: God's Word encounters humans in the proclaimed message (kerygma)
- **Faith and History**: Maintained tension between historical investigation and faith's affirmations
- **Existential Dialectic**: Explored dialectical relationship between past revelation and present decision

### Understanding of Faith

For Bultmann, authentic Christian faith is:

- **Eschatological Existence**: Living in light of God's future already breaking into the present
- **Radical Trust**: Surrendering self-secured existence for dependence on God
- **Freedom**: Liberation from bondage to the past and anxiety about the future
- **Authenticity**: Embracing one's finitude and living with resolute openness to possibility

### Theological Legacy

Though controversial, Bultmann's work has had lasting impact on several areas:

- **Biblical Hermeneutics**: Pioneered existential interpretation of scripture
- **Theological Method**: Demonstrated ways to engage critically with tradition while preserving its core meaning
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Integrated philosophy, history, and theology
- **Honest Scholarship**: Modeled intellectual integrity in service of faith

## Critical Reception and Controversies

### Orthodox Critiques

Bultmann's work provoked strong reactions from traditional Christian quarters:

- **Historical Skepticism**: Criticized for excessive skepticism about historical knowledge of Jesus
- **Supernatural Denial**: Rejected for eliminating core Christian affirmations about miracles and resurrection
- **Individualism**: Accused of reducing Christianity to individual decision, neglecting community and tradition
- **Philosophical Captivity**: Charged with subordinating biblical message to Heideggerian categories

### Barthian Critique

Karl Barth and his followers criticized Bultmann for:

- **Anthropological Focus**: Making human existence rather than God's revelation the center
- **Natural Theology**: Implicitly developing a form of natural theology based on existential analysis
- **Historical Relativism**: Undermining the concrete historical character of God's revelation
- **Reductionism**: Diminishing the cosmic scope of salvation to individual authenticity

### Post-Bultmannian Developments

Ironically, many of Bultmann's own students challenged aspects of his approach:

- **New Quest for the Historical Jesus**: Ernst Käsemann initiated renewed interest in historical Jesus, arguing more could be known than Bultmann allowed
- **Salvation History**: Oscar Cullmann emphasized the historical continuity of God's saving actions
- **Apocalyptic Emphasis**: Scholars like Jürgen Moltmann recovered apocalyptic dimensions Bultmann had demythologized
- **Sociological Analysis**: Later scholars supplemented existentialist interpretation with social and political dimensions

## Personal Faith and Character

Despite his radical scholarship, Bultmann maintained a personal faith that integrated his intellectual work:

- **Churchman**: Remained active in Lutheran church life and preaching
- **Pastoral Concern**: His work was motivated by desire to make Christian faith accessible to modern minds
- **Personal Piety**: Maintained traditional prayer life and spiritual practices
- **Integrity**: Pursued scholarly truth without compromise, even when controversial

## Influence and Legacy

- **Methodological Rigor**: Established higher standards for critical engagement with biblical texts
- **Hermeneutical Awareness**: Heightened consciousness of interpretive presuppositions
- **Existential Relevance**: Connected academic theology to questions of meaning and existence
- **Teacher's Legacy**: Trained influential scholars who continued and modified his approaches

### Contemporary Resonances

Bultmann's concerns remain relevant in contemporary theology:

- **Scientific Worldview**: His wrestling with modern scientific consciousness anticipated current science-religion dialogues
- **Mythology in Religion**: His analysis of mythological language foreshadowed current discussions about religious language
- **Existential Meaning**: His focus on personal meaning remains pertinent amid contemporary meaning crises
- **Hermeneutical Questions**: His work on interpretation informs current hermeneutical theories
