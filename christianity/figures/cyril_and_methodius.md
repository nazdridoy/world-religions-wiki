# Cyril and Methodius - Apostles to the Slavs and Creators of the Slavic Alphabet

![Cyril and Methodius](cyril_methodius.jpg)

Saints Cyril (Constantine) and Methodius were 9th-century Byzantine Greek brothers and Christian missionaries who profoundly shaped the religious and cultural landscape of Slavic Europe. Through their missionary work, linguistic innovations, and theological translations, they brought Christianity to Slavic peoples in their own language and laid the foundations for Slavic literature and cultural identity. Their development of the Glagolitic alphabet—the precursor to what would later be known as Cyrillic—allowed for the first written form of Slavic languages and the translation of sacred texts, establishing a unique, indigenized form of Christianity in Eastern Europe that bridged Byzantine and Western traditions.

## Early Lives and Education

### Methodius (c. 815-885)

Born to a prominent military family in Thessalonica (modern Thessaloniki), Methodius initially pursued a career in Byzantine administration. He served as governor of a Slavic-inhabited province, likely in Macedonia, which gave him valuable experience with Slavic peoples and their language. Around 840, Methodius abandoned his secular career to become a monk at the monastery of Polychron on Mount Olympus in Bithynia.

### Cyril (Constantine) (c. 827-869)

The younger brother, born Constantine but later taking the monastic name Cyril, displayed exceptional intellectual gifts from an early age. After their father's death, the influential chancellor Theoktistos became his guardian and ensured he received an outstanding education at the imperial university in Constantinople. There, he studied under the renowned scholar Photios (later Patriarch of Constantinople) and became highly proficient in grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and multiple languages.

Constantine's brilliance earned him the title "Philosopher," and he was appointed as professor of philosophy at the imperial school in Constantinople. His education, linguistic ability, and theological sophistication prepared him perfectly for his later missionary work.

## Early Missions

### Mission to the Arabs

Before their historic Slavic mission, the brothers undertook diplomatic-religious assignments for the Byzantine Empire. Around 851, Constantine was sent on a mission to the Abbasid Caliphate, where he engaged in theological debates with Muslim scholars in Samarra (in modern Iraq).

### Khazar Mission

In 860, the Byzantine Emperor Michael III dispatched both brothers to the Khazar Khaganate north of the Black Sea in response to a request for a Christian missionary. During this mission, Constantine reportedly discovered in Crimea what he believed to be relics of Pope Clement I. The brothers' diplomatic skills were evident as they engaged in theological discussions with Jewish and Muslim representatives at the Khazar court, though their mission achieved limited success in converting the Khazars.

## Great Moravian Mission

The brothers' most significant work began in 862 when Prince Rastislav of Great Moravia sent a request to Byzantine Emperor Michael III:

>"Our people have rejected paganism and observe Christian law, but we do not have a teacher who can explain the true faith to us in our own language."

This request had profound geopolitical implications. Moravia was caught between the influences of the Frankish Empire (whose German missionaries operated there) and Constantinople. By requesting Byzantine missionaries who could teach in the Slavic tongue, Rastislav sought to preserve Moravian independence from Frankish dominance.

Emperor Michael III selected Constantine and Methodius for this mission, likely because:
- They were familiar with the Slavic language from their native Thessalonica, which had a substantial Slavic population
- They possessed outstanding linguistic and theological capabilities
- They had proven successful in previous diplomatic-religious missions

### Creation of the Glagolitic Alphabet

Before departing for Moravia in 863, Constantine created an alphabet specifically designed to represent Slavic sounds. This original alphabet, now called Glagolitic (from the Old Slavonic _glagolъ_, "word" or "speech"), was entirely new and consisted of 41 letters. Later, a simplified version evolved into what is now known as the Cyrillic alphabet, named in Constantine's honor.

This linguistic innovation allowed the brothers to undertake their most substantial achievement: translating religious texts into what became known as Old Church Slavonic. Before departing Constantinople, they translated selections from the Gospels, the Apostolos (Acts and Epistles), the Psalter, and various liturgical texts.

### Work in Great Moravia

Upon arriving in Moravia in 863, the brothers established an academy where they trained disciples in the new script and translations. Their approach was revolutionary—rather than imposing Greek or Latin as the language of worship, they:

1. Celebrated the liturgy in the local Slavic tongue
2. Translated biblical and liturgical texts into Slavonic
3. Trained local clergy who could minister in their native language

This approach made Christianity more accessible to the common people but provoked opposition from Frankish missionaries who adhered to the "trilingual heresy"—the belief that liturgy could only be conducted in Hebrew, Greek, or Latin.

## Opposition and Papal Approval

The brothers' mission faced significant resistance from German clergy who viewed the Slavonic liturgy as a threat to their influence in the region and argued that worship in vernacular languages was heretical. In 867, the brothers were summoned to Rome to defend their innovative approach.

Their journey to Rome was interrupted by a stay in Venice, where they engaged in a theological debate with Latin clerics who opposed liturgy in languages other than Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. Constantine eloquently defended the right of all peoples to worship in their native tongues.

Before reaching Rome, Pope Nicholas I, who had summoned them, died. His successor, Pope Hadrian II, received them warmly in 868. Several factors contributed to their favorable reception:

1. The brothers brought with them the alleged relics of Pope Clement I that Constantine had discovered in Crimea
2. Their theological explanations were sound and convincing
3. Their approach aligned with the pope's interest in limiting German ecclesiastical influence

In a monumental victory for their mission, Pope Hadrian II approved the Slavonic liturgy and ordered that their translations be placed on the altar of St. Mary Major Basilica in Rome, symbolically sanctioning Slavonic as a liturgical language.

## Later Years and Legacy

### Cyril's Death

Shortly after achieving papal approval, Constantine fell ill in Rome. He took monastic vows and the name Cyril shortly before his death on February 14, 869. He was buried in the Basilica of San Clemente in Rome, where his tomb remains an important pilgrimage site.

### Methodius as Archbishop

Pope Hadrian II consecrated Methodius as Archbishop of Sirmium (now Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) with jurisdiction over Great Moravia and Pannonia. When Methodius returned to continue his mission, he faced renewed opposition from Frankish clergy. In 870, he was imprisoned for two and a half years by Bavarian bishops until Pope John VIII secured his release.

Despite ongoing opposition, Methodius continued his work, extending translations to include most of the Bible and the church fathers' writings. He died on April 6, 885, in Great Moravia, having appointed his disciple Gorazd as his successor.

### Aftermath

Following Methodius's death, his disciples faced severe persecution from Frankish clergy with support from the new Moravian ruler, Svatopluk I. Many were sold into slavery, while others fled south to Bulgaria, Serbia, and Croatia, where they continued the Cyrillo-Methodian tradition.

This expulsion had the unintended consequence of spreading Slavonic literacy and Orthodox Christianity throughout the Balkans, laying the foundation for the distinctive religious and cultural identity of the South Slavic nations.

## Cultural and Religious Significance

The brothers' work had far-reaching consequences across multiple dimensions:

### Linguistic and Literary Impact

The creation of the Glagolitic alphabet and the subsequent development of the Cyrillic script provided Slavic peoples with their first writing system. This innovation:

- Enabled the emergence of Slavic literary culture
- Preserved unique aspects of Slavic oral tradition and cultural identity
- Influenced the development of multiple modern Slavic languages
- Created a cultural counterbalance to Greco-Roman dominance

Old Church Slavonic became the third major liturgical language of Christianity (after Greek and Latin) and remained the liturgical and literary language throughout Slavic Orthodox churches for centuries.

### Religious Significance

The brothers' approach to mission represented an early model of what would later be called "inculturation"—adapting the presentation of Christianity to local cultural contexts without compromising doctrinal substance. Their key innovations included:

- Celebrating liturgy in local languages rather than imposing foreign ones
- Training indigenous clergy rather than relying on foreign missionaries
- Translating scripture to make it directly accessible to converts
- Respecting local cultural forms while introducing Christian content

### Political and Historical Impact

The Cyrillo-Methodian mission established a complex religious-cultural frontier in Central and Eastern Europe. By legitimizing Slavonic as a liturgical language, they:

- Created religious and cultural autonomy for Slavic peoples
- Established a distinctive tradition that bridged Eastern and Western Christianity
- Provided the foundation for what would later develop into distinct Orthodox Slavic cultures
- Set precedents for vernacular liturgy that would resurface during the Reformation

## Veneration and Modern Recognition

Both brothers were canonized as saints by Eastern and Western churches, though through different historical processes. They are venerated as "Equal to the Apostles" in Orthodox tradition and as "Patrons of Europe" (along with Benedict of Nursia) in the Catholic Church (declared by Pope John Paul II in 1980).

Their legacy is celebrated across Slavic countries with particular prominence:

- In Bulgaria, May 24 is a national holiday celebrating their work (Bulgarian Education and Culture, and Slavonic Literature Day)
- In North Macedonia, their mission is commemorated on May 24 as "Saints Cyril and Methodius Day"
- In Russia, the brothers are honored as foundational figures in Russian Orthodox culture
- In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, they are revered as national saints

The Cyrillo-Methodian legacy remains an important point of ecumenical connection between Catholic and Orthodox churches, symbolizing their shared heritage before the East-West Schism.
