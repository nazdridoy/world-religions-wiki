# Clare of Assisi - Founder of the Poor Clares

![Clare of Assisi](clare_of_assisi.jpg)

Clare of Assisi stands as one of the most significant female figures in medieval Christianity and the first woman to write a monastic rule approved by the Catholic Church. As the founder of the Order of Poor Ladies, later known as the Poor Clares, she developed a radical vision of contemplative religious life characterized by absolute poverty, enclosure, and devotion. Her close spiritual partnership with Francis of Assisi reshaped female monasticism and left a lasting legacy that continues through the thousands of Poor Clare nuns who follow her rule today. Clare's unwavering commitment to apostolic poverty and her mystical spirituality make her one of the most compelling saints of the Franciscan tradition.

## Early Life and Conversion

Born in 1194 to the noble Offreduccio family in Assisi, Italy, Clare (Chiara) grew up amid the privilege of medieval aristocracy. Her father, Favarone di Offreduccio, was a wealthy knight, and her mother, Ortolana, was a devout woman who undertook pilgrimages to Rome, Santiago de Compostela, and the Holy Land. From an early age, Clare displayed exceptional devotion and charity, reportedly setting aside food from the family table to give to the poor.

The defining moment of Clare's life came when she heard Francis of Assisi preach during the Lenten season of 1212. Francis, who had recently established his new order of friars, was preaching a message of radical poverty and evangelical simplicity that resonated deeply with the 18-year-old noblewoman. After several secret meetings with Francis to discuss her spiritual calling, Clare made her decision to abandon her privileged life.

On Palm Sunday night in 1212, Clare left her family home and met Francis and his brothers at the Porziuncula, a small chapel in the valley below Assisi. There, in a dramatic ceremony that represented her marriage to Christ, Francis cut off Clare's hair and clothed her in a rough tunic and veil. To protect her from her family's attempts to forcibly retrieve her, Francis immediately placed Clare temporarily in the Benedictine convent of San Paolo delle Abbadesse.

## Founding of the Poor Ladies of San Damiano

When Clare's family discovered her whereabouts, they attempted to remove her by force, but Clare firmly resisted. She clung to the altar cloths and revealed her shorn head, a visible sign of her consecration. Eventually, her family relented, and Clare moved to another Benedictine monastery at Sant'Angelo in Panzo, where she was soon joined by her younger sister Catherine (later known as Sister Agnes).

Soon after, Francis established Clare and her earliest followers at the small church of San Damiano, which he had previously restored with his own hands. Here, Clare became abbess of the first community of the "Poor Ladies of San Damiano," later known as the Order of Saint Clare or the Poor Clares. The community grew quickly, with many noble women from Assisi and surrounding regions joining, including Clare's mother and another sister, Beatrice.

Clare's vision for her community was radical even by the standards of the time. When Pope Gregory IX offered to absolve her from her vow of absolute poverty, Clare famously replied, "Holy Father, I crave for absolution from my sins, but not from the obligation of following Jesus Christ." Her insistence on complete poverty for her order—owning no property even communally—was nearly unprecedented and faced significant resistance from church authorities concerned about the practical sustainability of such extreme austerity.

## The Rule of Saint Clare

Clare's most significant achievement was the creation and papal approval of her own monastic rule—a remarkable accomplishment for a woman in 13th-century Europe. For decades, she struggled with church authorities who attempted to impose more moderate, traditional rules on her community.

Initially, Cardinal Hugolino (later Pope Gregory IX) had written a rule based on the Benedictine model for Clare's community, allowing for communal property holdings. Clare, however, persistently sought the "Privilege of Poverty"—the right to own nothing—which she finally received from Pope Innocent IV in 1228.

After Francis's death, Clare spent nearly 27 years refining and defending her vision. Finally, just two days before her death in 1253, Pope Innocent IV approved Clare's own rule—making it the first religious rule written by a woman to receive papal approval. The Rule of Saint Clare emphasized:

- **Absolute Poverty**: No possessions individually or communally
- **Contemplative Prayer**: Centered on the Eucharist and the Passion of Christ
- **Enclosure**: Strict seclusion from the world
- **Community Life**: Characterized by equality and mutual service
- **Alignment with Franciscan Ideals**: Maintaining spiritual ties with the Friars Minor

Clare's rule created a distinctively feminine expression of Franciscan spirituality that balanced contemplation with the radical poverty that was central to Francis's vision.

## Spiritual Life and Mysticism

Clare's spirituality centered on what she called the "privilege of poverty" and intense devotion to the Eucharist and the Passion of Christ. She wrote, "Love that cannot suffer is not worthy of that name," reflecting her embrace of both physical austerities and the spiritual path of identification with Christ's suffering.

Her letters to Agnes of Prague, a Bohemian princess who founded a Poor Clare monastery, provide the most direct insight into Clare's spiritual teachings. These letters reveal Clare's mystical theology, particularly her understanding of the contemplative life as a "mirror" in which one gazes upon Christ:

"Place your mind before the mirror of eternity!
Place your soul in the brilliance of glory!
Place your heart in the figure of the divine substance!
And transform your entire being into the image of the Godhead itself
through contemplation!"

Clare's writings display profound theological depth, describing stages of contemplation that progress from gazing upon Christ's poverty in the manger, to following him in suffering, and ultimately to resting in his glory. This contemplative relationship with Christ was the foundation of Clare's spiritual life and the source of her remarkable courage and perseverance.

## Leadership and Influence

Although strictly enclosed within San Damiano, Clare's influence extended far beyond the monastery walls. As the founder of a new religious order, she maintained correspondence with other communities of Poor Ladies that were rapidly spreading throughout Europe. Her letters to Agnes of Prague provide guidance on both spiritual matters and practical aspects of implementing their austere rule.

Clare's leadership style differed markedly from the hierarchical norms of medieval abbesses. Though titled "abbess," she insisted on being called "sister" and served her fellow nuns in the most humble tasks. Contemporary accounts describe her washing the feet of returning lay sisters, serving at table, and caring personally for the sick.

Clare maintained a close spiritual relationship with Francis, consulting with him regularly until his death in 1226. After his passing, she became one of the principal guardians of his spiritual legacy, sometimes defending his original vision of absolute poverty even against modifications adopted by the Franciscan friars themselves.

During her nearly 40 years at San Damiano, Clare never left the enclosure. Yet her reputation for holiness, wisdom, and miraculous healings attracted visitors from all levels of society seeking her counsel and prayers.

## Miracles and Last Years

Clare is associated with several miracles, both during her lifetime and after her death. The most famous occurred in 1240-1241 when Saracen mercenaries employed by Emperor Frederick II were attacking Assisi. As they scaled the walls of San Damiano, Clare—though severely ill—had herself carried to the window with a monstrance containing the Blessed Sacrament. Upon raising the Eucharist toward the invaders, they reportedly fell back and fled, leaving the monastery unharmed.

On another occasion, when there was only half a loaf of bread to feed the entire community, Clare blessed it and miraculously multiplied it to satisfy everyone's hunger. These and other reported miracles contributed to her swift canonization.

In her later years, Clare suffered from persistent illness but continued to lead her community with remarkable fortitude. Even while bedridden, she reportedly worked embroidery to be made into altar cloths for churches in the valley.

As she approached death in 1253, she was visited by Pope Innocent IV, who finally approved her rule. She died on August 11, 1253, reportedly whispering to herself: "Go forth in peace, for you have followed the good road. Go forth without fear, for He who created you has sanctified you, has always protected you, and loves you as a mother. Blessed be You, O God, for having created me."

## Legacy and Influence

Clare was canonized remarkably quickly, just two years after her death, by Pope Alexander IV. Her body, which had been buried in the church of San Giorgio in Assisi, was transferred in 1260 to the newly built Basilica of Saint Clare, where it remains today. When her tomb was opened in 1850, her body was found incorrupt.

Clare's enduring legacy includes:

- **The Order of Saint Clare**: The Poor Clares continue as a contemplative Franciscan order with approximately 20,000 nuns worldwide in over 75 countries
- **Franciscan Spirituality**: Clare's interpretation of Francis's ideals helped shape the broader Franciscan spiritual tradition
- **Women's Leadership**: As the first woman to write an approved religious rule, she expanded possibilities for female agency within the Church
- **Contemplative Tradition**: Her emphasis on contemplative prayer and poverty influenced Western Christian mysticism
- **Eucharistic Devotion**: Her focus on the Eucharist contributed to the development of Eucharistic adoration in Catholic practice

Clare's theological writings, though limited in quantity, have been increasingly recognized for their mystical depth and originality. Her concept of the "mirror of eternity"—contemplating Christ as a mirror in which one sees both God and one's true self—represents a unique contribution to Christian mystical theology.

In 1958, Pope Pius XII designated Clare as the patron saint of television because she had reportedly been shown visions of distant Franciscan liturgies on the wall of her cell when she was too ill to attend—a form of "remote viewing" that suggested a parallel to modern television.

## Artistic Representations

Clare is typically depicted in art wearing the gray or brown habit of the Poor Clares with a white cord and black veil. She is often shown:

- Holding a monstrance or ciborium (referencing her miracle with the Saracens)
- With a lily, symbolizing purity
- With Francis of Assisi, reflecting their spiritual partnership
- With a book (her rule)
- With a lamp or torch (referencing her name, which means "light" or "clear")

Famous representations include works by Simone Martini, Pietro Lorenzetti, and the Franciscan Basilica frescoes.
