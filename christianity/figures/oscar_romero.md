# Óscar Romero - Martyred Archbishop and Voice of the Oppressed

![Óscar Romero](oscar_romero.jpg)

Óscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdámez (1917-1980) was a Salvadoran Roman Catholic archbishop who became an outspoken defender of the poor and a vocal critic of political violence during El Salvador's civil conflict. Initially considered a conservative choice for archbishop, Romero underwent a profound transformation following the assassination of his friend, Jesuit priest Rutilio Grande. He became increasingly outspoken against poverty, social injustice, assassinations, and torture amid escalating violence in El Salvador. His weekly radio broadcasts documenting human rights abuses became a trusted source of information for Salvadorans. Romero was assassinated while celebrating Mass on March 24, 1980, one day after delivering a sermon calling on soldiers to disobey orders to kill civilians. Canonized in 2018, he remains a powerful symbol of speaking truth to power and standing with the marginalized.

## Early Life and Ministry

Óscar Romero was born into a modest family in Ciudad Barrios, El Salvador. He demonstrated an early vocation to the priesthood and was sent to Rome for seminary studies in 1937. He was ordained in 1942 and returned to El Salvador where he served as a parish priest, seminary rector, and editor of the archdiocesan newspaper.

Known for his diligence and administrative skills, Romero was appointed auxiliary bishop of San Salvador in 1970, bishop of Santiago de María in 1974, and finally archbishop of San Salvador in 1977. His appointment as archbishop was welcomed by the government and wealthy elites who viewed him as conservative, pious, and unlikely to challenge the status quo.

## Transformation and Prophetic Ministry

Romero's outlook changed dramatically on March 12, 1977, when his friend, Jesuit priest Rutilio Grande, was murdered along with two companions while traveling to celebrate Mass. Grande had been organizing peasants in Aguilares to form self-reliant groups and become more politically aware. His assassination deeply affected Romero, who later said: "When I looked at Rutilio lying there dead, I thought, 'If they have killed him for doing what he did, then I too have to walk the same path.'"

In response to Grande's murder, Romero took unprecedented actions:
- Canceled all Masses throughout the archdiocese except for one unified Mass at the cathedral
- Refused to attend any government functions or meet with the president until Grande's murder was investigated
- Established a permanent record of human rights abuses through the archdiocesan legal aid center

His weekly Sunday homilies, broadcast by radio throughout the country, became a national phenomenon. In these broadcasts, he:
- Reported on human rights violations
- Named victims of state violence and disappearances
- Called for structural reforms to address poverty and injustice
- Denounced both left-wing and right-wing terrorism

## Theological Perspective

Romero's theological development was influenced by:

- **Vatican II**: Embraced the Council's call for the Church to be engaged with contemporary issues
- **Medellín Conference**: Applied Latin American bishops' "preferential option for the poor"
- **Liberation Theology**: While not formally aligned with liberation theology, shared its concern for structural justice
- **Catholic Social Teaching**: Grounded his critiques in traditional Catholic principles of human dignity

Contrary to his critics' claims, Romero was not a Marxist but rather drew from Catholic tradition to address injustice. He criticized both American-backed capitalism and Marxist solutions, seeking a distinctly Christian response to social problems.

## Opposition and Death

As Romero became more outspoken, he faced increasing opposition:
- Conservative bishops within El Salvador distanced themselves from him
- The Salvadoran government and military viewed him as a subversive
- He received multiple death threats
- The Vatican expressed concerns about his approach

Despite these pressures, Romero refused to be silenced. On March 23, 1980, he delivered his most famous homily, addressing soldiers directly: "In the name of God, and in the name of this suffering people whose laments rise to heaven each day more tumultuous, I beg you, I ask you, I order you in the name of God: Stop the repression!"

The following day, March 24, while celebrating Mass at a hospital chapel, Romero was shot through the heart by an assassin. Evidence later linked his assassination to Salvadoran military death squads, though no one was ever convicted of the murder. His funeral Mass drew an estimated 250,000 mourners and was itself disrupted by violence when explosions and gunfire in the square left dozens dead.

## Legacy and Canonization

After his death, Romero's legacy continued to evolve:
- **Political Symbol**: Became an icon for human rights movements throughout Latin America
- **Theological Influence**: Exemplified a church committed to justice and the poor
- **Controversy**: His path to sainthood was delayed for years due to Vatican concerns about politicization
- **Rehabilitation**: Pope Francis, the first Latin American pope, prioritized Romero's cause
- **Canonization**: Declared a martyr in 2015 and canonized as a saint on October 14, 2018

Romero's canonization represented a significant shift in the Catholic Church's understanding of martyrdom—recognition that he was killed out of "hatred for the faith" as expressed through his defense of the vulnerable, not merely for political reasons.

## Cultural Impact

Romero's life and martyrdom have had a profound cultural impact:
- **Literature**: Featured in numerous books, poems, and plays
- **Film**: His story told in the 1989 film *Romero* starring Raúl Juliá
- **Music**: Commemorated in songs by various artists
- **Art**: Depicted in murals and religious artwork throughout Latin America
- **Memorials**: Westminster Abbey in London includes a statue of Romero among its 20th-century martyrs

His words continue to inspire social justice movements around the world, with many activists drawing on his example of courage in confronting systemic injustice.

## Contemporary Relevance

Romero's witness remains relevant to contemporary issues:
- **Economic Inequality**: His critique of structural poverty speaks to ongoing disparities
- **Political Polarization**: Offers a model of principled engagement transcending partisan divides
- **Human Rights**: Provides a moral framework for addressing modern human rights abuses
- **Church-State Relations**: Exemplifies prophetic witness when political powers threaten human dignity
- **Refugee Crisis**: His advocacy for the displaced resonates with current migration challenges

Pope Francis has frequently cited Romero as an example of a pastor who was "close to the poor and to his people."
