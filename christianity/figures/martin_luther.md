![Martin Luther](../../images/martin_luther.jpg)

Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a German theologian, priest, and professor whose challenge to the Roman Catholic Church sparked the Protestant Reformation. His questioning of church practices, particularly the sale of indulgences, and his emphasis on salvation by faith alone rather than by good works or church sacraments, permanently altered the religious landscape of Europe and beyond. His translation of the Bible into German helped standardize the German language and made scripture directly accessible to ordinary people for the first time.

## Early Life and Education

Born to a copper miner's family in Eisleben, Saxony (part of the Holy Roman Empire), Luther's path to becoming a reformer included:

- Studies at the University of Erfurt, earning a Master of Arts degree (1505)
- A dramatic conversion experience during a thunderstorm, prompting him to become a monk
- Joining the Augustinian order despite his father's opposition
- Ordination as a priest (1507)
- Doctoral studies in theology at the University of Wittenberg
- Appointment as professor of biblical studies at Wittenberg (1512)

Luther's early spiritual life was marked by intense anxiety over his salvation. Despite rigorous monastic discipline, fasting, prayer, and confession, he found no peace. This personal struggle would significantly influence his theological breakthrough regarding justification by faith.

## The 95 Theses and Break with Rome

Luther's reformation movement began with his response to the sale of indulgences (documents said to reduce punishment for sins) by Johann Tetzel to finance the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Key events included:

- October 31, 1517: Luther posts his "Ninety-Five Theses" (Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences) on the door of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg
- 1518: Luther defends his positions at the Heidelberg Disputation
- 1519: Debates Johann Eck at the Leipzig Disputation, where Luther questions papal authority
- 1520: Publishes three influential treatises outlining his developing theology:
  - "To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation"
  - "On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church"
  - "On the Freedom of a Christian"
- June 15, 1520: Pope Leo X threatens excommunication in the papal bull "Exsurge Domine"
- December 10, 1520: Luther burns the papal bull
- January 3, 1521: Luther is excommunicated
- April 1521: Summoned before the Diet of Worms, Luther refuses to recant
- May 1521: The Edict of Worms declares Luther an outlaw

After the Diet of Worms, Luther was hidden at Wartburg Castle by his prince, Frederick the Wise of Saxony, where he translated the New Testament into German and continued writing.

## Theological Contributions

Luther's theology revolutionized Western Christianity with several key concepts:

### Justification by Faith Alone (Sola Fide)
- Salvation comes through faith in Christ, not through works or sacraments
- God imputes righteousness to believers rather than them earning it

### Scripture Alone (Sola Scriptura)
- The Bible is the sole authority for Christian doctrine
- Individual believers can and should read and interpret scripture
- Tradition, councils, and popes are subordinate to biblical authority

### Priesthood of All Believers
- All baptized Christians are spiritually equal before God
- Special ordination does not confer superior spiritual status
- Every Christian has direct access to God without priestly mediation

### Two Kingdoms Doctrine
- Distinction between God's spiritual kingdom (the church) and temporal kingdom (civil authority)
- Christians live simultaneously under both authorities
- Basis for later development of separation of church and state

## Later Life and Controversies

After establishing the reformation movement, Luther:

- Married former nun Katharina von Bora in 1525
- Had six children, establishing a model for Protestant clergy families
- Composed hymns, including "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God"
- Wrote extensively on theology, church practices, and societal issues
- Responded to the Peasants' War with harsh condemnation of rebellion
- Engaged in increasingly bitter polemics, particularly against Jews, Anabaptists, and the papacy
- Continued teaching at Wittenberg University
- Died in Eisleben, his birthplace, in 1546

Luther's later writings against Jews, particularly "On the Jews and Their Lies" (1543), have been a source of controversy and have been used to justify antisemitism. Modern Lutheran denominations have officially repudiated these views.

## Legacy and Influence

Luther's impact has been immense and multifaceted:

- **Religious**: Spawned the Protestant Reformation and numerous denominations
- **Political**: Contributed to the decline of the Holy Roman Empire and rise of territorial states
- **Cultural**: German Bible translation standardized the German language
- **Educational**: Advocated universal education to enable Bible reading
- **Musical**: Reformed church music, composed hymns, and elevated congregation participation
- **Social**: Established the married pastor model that became standard in Protestantism
- **Theological**: Reoriented Western Christianity around grace and scripture

His portrait of religious individualism and conscience has deeply influenced modern Western values beyond religion itself.
