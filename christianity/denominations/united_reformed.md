The United Reformed Church (URC) is a Protestant Christian denomination formed in the United Kingdom in 1972 through the union of the Presbyterian Church of England and the Congregational Church in England and Wales, with subsequent unions with the Re-formed Association of Churches of Christ (1981) and the Congregational Union of Scotland (2000). With approximately 46,000 members in around 1,300 congregations, the URC embodies a unique blend of Reformed theological heritage and congregational governance, while maintaining a distinctly progressive and ecumenical ethos. The denomination is characterized by its commitment to social justice, inclusive approach to ministry, congregational autonomy balanced with conciliar oversight, and ongoing engagement with contemporary ethical and theological issues.
