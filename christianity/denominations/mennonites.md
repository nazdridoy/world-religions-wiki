# Mennonites

![Mennonites](../../images/mennonites.jpg)

Mennonites are members of a Christian group belonging to the historic peace churches that emerged during the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. Named after Menno Simons (1496-1561), a former Dutch Catholic priest who became an influential Anabaptist leader, Mennonites are known for their emphasis on adult baptism, nonviolence, separation of church and state, and simple living. Today, more than 2.1 million Mennonites exist worldwide across a spectrum from highly traditional to progressive communities.

## Historical Development

### Anabaptist Origins (1520s)

Mennonites emerged from the radical wing of the Protestant Reformation:
- Swiss Brethren movement began in Zürich in 1525 with the first adult rebaptism
- Early leaders included Conrad Grebel, Felix Manz, and George Blaurock
- Rejected infant baptism as unbiblical, practicing believer's baptism instead
- Faced severe persecution from both Catholic and Protestant authorities
- Thousands were martyred for their faith (documented in Martyrs Mirror)

### Menno Simons' Leadership (1536-1561)

After the disastrous Münster Rebellion (1534-1535), Menno Simons provided crucial leadership:
- Renounced Catholic priesthood and joined the Anabaptists in 1536
- Emphasized nonviolence, rejecting the violent apocalypticism of Münster
- Developed theological foundation for peaceful Anabaptist movement
- Traveled extensively organizing congregations in the Netherlands and Germany
- Authored influential works including "Foundation of Christian Doctrine"

### Migration and Diversification

Persecution led to centuries of migration:
- Movement into Eastern Europe (Poland, Prussia, Russia) in the 17th-18th centuries
- Development of distinctive cultural traditions and German dialect (Plautdietsch)
- Major migrations to North America beginning in the late 17th century
- 19th century Russian Mennonite migrations to the United States, Canada, and Latin America
- 20th century growth in the Global South through mission work
