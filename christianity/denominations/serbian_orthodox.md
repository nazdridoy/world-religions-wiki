# Serbian Orthodox Church

![Serbian Orthodox Church](serbian_orthodox.jpg)

The Serbian Orthodox Church (Српска православна црква/Srpska pravoslavna crkva) is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Church primarily serving the Serbian people across Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and diaspora communities worldwide. With approximately 8 million adherents, it represents one of the historically significant national churches within Eastern Orthodoxy. The Church maintains Byzantine liturgical traditions while expressing a distinctly Serbian cultural character shaped by centuries of history, including periods of Ottoman occupation, national revival, Communist suppression, and post-Yugoslav reorganization. Canonically recognized in 1219 under its first archbishop Saint Sava, the Serbian Orthodox Church continues to play a central role in Serbian national identity, culture, and spiritual life.
