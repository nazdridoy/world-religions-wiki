# Global Pentecostalism

![Global Pentecostalism](global_pentecostalism.jpg)

Global Pentecostalism represents one of the most dynamic and rapidly growing expressions of Christianity in the world today. Characterized by an emphasis on the direct experience of the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues (glossolalia), divine healing, prophecy, and emotional worship, Pentecostalism has expanded from its early 20th-century origins to become a major force shaping contemporary Christianity. With an estimated 500-600 million adherents worldwide, Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity is particularly influential in Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia, where it continues to transform religious landscapes and cultural expressions.
