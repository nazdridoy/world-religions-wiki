# Global Christian Forum

![Global Christian Forum gathering](gcf_meeting.jpg)

The Global Christian Forum (GCF) is an innovative ecumenical initiative established in the late 1990s that brings together representatives from the broadest range of Christian traditions worldwide. Unlike other ecumenical bodies, the GCF uniquely encompasses participants from Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Anglican, Evangelical, Pentecostal, and independent churches, including many who have historically remained outside formal ecumenical structures. Operating with a lean organizational structure and focusing on relationship-building rather than institutional integration, the GCF creates space for open conversation and mutual recognition through its distinctive methodology of sharing faith stories. This approach has enabled unprecedented dialogue between Christian traditions that previously had limited interaction, making the GCF a significant development in 21st-century ecumenical relations.
