The Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) is the largest conservative Presbyterian denomination in the United States, representing a theologically Reformed, evangelical expression of Christianity. With approximately 1,900 congregations and 380,000 members, the PCA maintains a significant presence in American Protestantism, particularly in the Southeast. Founded in 1973 as a conservative alternative to mainline Presbyterianism, the denomination emphasizes biblical inerrancy, Reformed theology, evangelistic mission, and traditional social values while maintaining Presbyterian polity and Reformed worship.
