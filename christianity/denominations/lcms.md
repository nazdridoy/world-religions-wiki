# Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod

![Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod](lcms.jpg)

The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod (LCMS) is a conservative confessional Lutheran denomination in the United States, representing one of the largest traditionally confessional Lutheran bodies in America with approximately 1.8 million baptized members. Founded in 1847 by German immigrants seeking to preserve orthodox Lutheran theology and practice, the LCMS is distinguished by its firm commitment to the authority of Scripture, adherence to the Lutheran Confessions as contained in the Book of Concord, historic liturgical worship, and a congregational polity balanced with strong denominational structure. The LCMS maintains significant educational and missionary enterprises worldwide while consistently defending traditional Christian doctrines and practices against theological liberalism, maintaining its position as a theologically conservative alternative within American Lutheranism.
