# Cultural Catholicism

![Cultural Catholic celebration](cultural_catholicism.jpg)

Cultural Catholicism refers to the social, cultural, and ethnic expressions of Catholic identity that exist independently of strict religious adherence or regular sacramental participation. It encompasses individuals and communities who identify with Catholic traditions, celebrations, values, and aesthetics as part of their cultural heritage, even while potentially maintaining varied levels of formal religious practice or doctrinal belief. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in historically Catholic societies in Europe, Latin America, and among diaspora communities, where Catholicism has deeply influenced national and ethnic identities, social customs, artistic expressions, and moral frameworks over centuries, creating a Catholic cultural identity that persists even amid declining formal religious practice.
