The Salvation Army is a Protestant Christian denomination and international charitable organization founded in 1865 by William and Catherine Booth in London, England. Structured with a quasi-military organizational pattern, the Salvation Army combines evangelical Protestant Christianity with extensive social services, operating in over 130 countries worldwide and serving millions through its ministries, relief efforts, and community programs.

## Origins and Development

The Salvation Army emerged from the Christian Revival Society, later known as the East London Christian Mission, established by Methodist minister William Booth. Key developments include:

- William Booth's initial work among the urban poor in London's East End in 1865
- Catherine Booth's influential role in shaping the organization's theology and women's leadership
- Adoption of military terminology and structure in 1878, becoming "The Salvation Army"
- Development of distinctive uniforms, brass bands, and public evangelism
- Expansion to the United States in 1880, followed by rapid international growth
- Integration of social welfare with evangelism in response to urban poverty
- Establishment of the "War Cry" publication (1879) for outreach and fundraising
- Development of extensive disaster relief capabilities throughout the 20th century
- Evolution into one of the world's largest non-governmental providers of social services
