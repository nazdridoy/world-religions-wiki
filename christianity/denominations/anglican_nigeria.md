# Anglican Church of Nigeria

![Anglican Church of Nigeria](anglican_nigeria.jpg)

The Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) is the largest Anglican province in the worldwide Anglican Communion, with over 18 million members. Founded through British missionary work in the 19th century, it has developed into a distinctly African expression of Anglicanism known for its evangelical theology, rapid growth, and influential role in global Anglican affairs. The Church has taken strong conservative theological positions, particularly regarding biblical authority, traditional marriage, and sexuality, which has led to significant tensions with more progressive Anglican provinces in the Global North.
