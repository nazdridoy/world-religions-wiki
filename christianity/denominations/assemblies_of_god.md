# Assemblies of God

![Assemblies of God](../../images/assemblies_god.jpg)

The Assemblies of God (AG) is one of the largest Pentecostal denominations in the world, with approximately 69 million adherents worldwide. Founded in 1914 in Hot Springs, Arkansas, it emerged during the early Pentecostal revival in the United States.

## Origins and Development

The Assemblies of God formed as various independent Pentecostal ministers and congregations sought organizational unity following the Azusa Street Revival (1906-1909). The founding convention in April 1914 brought together about 300 people from diverse backgrounds who shared experiences of Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.

Key founding figures included E.N. Bell (the first chairman), J. Roswell Flower, and D.W. Kerr. Unlike some Pentecostal groups of the era, the AG founders intentionally created a cooperative fellowship rather than a hierarchical denomination, emphasizing congregational governance while maintaining doctrinal unity.

## Core Beliefs

The Assemblies of God adheres to Pentecostal theology with these distinctive beliefs:

- **Baptism in the Holy Spirit**: A post-conversion experience evidenced initially by speaking in tongues
- **Divine Healing**: Belief that physical healing is provided in Christ's atonement
- **Gifts of the Spirit**: Active operation of all spiritual gifts in the contemporary church
- **Premillennial Eschatology**: Belief in the imminent return of Christ
- **Evangelistic Mission**: Strong emphasis on worldwide evangelism and missions

The denomination maintains a balance between Pentecostal distinctives and broader evangelical theology, affirming the inspiration of Scripture, the Trinity, salvation by grace through faith, and water baptism by immersion.

## Structure and Governance

The Assemblies of God operates with a unique combination of:

- **Congregational Autonomy**: Local churches own their property and select their pastors
- **Presbyterian Elements**: District and national leadership bodies provide oversight and credentialing
- **Episcopal Functions**: General Superintendent and Executive Presbytery offer denominational leadership

This balanced approach has helped the AG maintain doctrinal stability while allowing contextual flexibility, contributing to its global growth.

## Global Presence

From its American origins, the Assemblies of God has become a truly global movement with:

- **Strong Growth** in Latin America, Africa, and Asia
- **Indigenous Leadership** emphasized in national churches
- **Missionary Networks** connecting global AG bodies
- **Educational Institutions** on six continents

The World Assemblies of God Fellowship serves as a fraternal organization connecting independent national AG bodies rather than functioning as a central governing authority.

## Contemporary Issues

As the denomination navigates the 21st century, it faces several challenges:

- Balancing Pentecostal distinctives with broader evangelical identity
- Addressing cultural shifts while maintaining doctrinal foundations
- Navigating political diversity among its constituency
- Emphasizing racial reconciliation and multicultural ministry
- Developing leadership for a new generation
