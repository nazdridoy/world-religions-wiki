# World Council of Churches

![World Council of Churches headquarters in Geneva](wcc_headquarters.jpg)

The World Council of Churches (WCC) stands as the broadest and most inclusive ecumenical organization in contemporary Christianity, bringing together churches, denominations and church fellowships in more than 110 countries and territories throughout the world. Founded in 1948 in Amsterdam, the WCC represents over 350 member churches spanning Protestant, Anglican, Orthodox, and other traditions, encompassing more than 580 million Christians globally. While the Roman Catholic Church is not a member, it cooperates closely with the Council. As a fellowship of churches seeking unity, common witness and service, the WCC works to overcome historical divisions through theological dialogue, shared mission, advocacy for justice and peace, and coordinated humanitarian response. Despite facing challenges from both conservative criticism and institutional limitations, the WCC continues to serve as Christianity's primary instrument for visible church unity and common Christian voice in global affairs.
