# Church of Scotland

![Church of Scotland General Assembly](church_of_scotland.jpg)

The Church of Scotland (Scots: Kirk o Scotland, Scottish Gaelic: Eaglais na h-Alba) is the national church of Scotland and the country's largest Protestant denomination. Established during the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century, it is Presbyterian in polity and Reformed in theology. Often referred to as "The Kirk," it maintains a distinctive combination of state recognition without state control, serving as the national church while maintaining independence in spiritual matters. With approximately 300,000 members (as of 2022) and over 1,000 congregations throughout Scotland, the Church of Scotland plays a significant role in Scottish religious, cultural, and social life despite declining attendance in recent decades. Its governance through courts (Kirk Sessions, Presbyteries, and General Assembly) and emphasis on the authority of Scripture reflects its Presbyterian heritage derived from the work of John Knox and the broader Reformed tradition.
