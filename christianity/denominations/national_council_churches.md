![National Council of Churches Logo](../images/ncc_logo.jpg)

The National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, commonly known as the National Council of Churches (NCC), is an ecumenical partnership of 38 Christian faith groups in the United States. Representing Protestant, Anglican, Orthodox, Evangelical, historic African American, and Living Peace church traditions, the NCC serves as one of the leading voices for Christian unity and cooperative ministry in American religious life.

## Overview

Founded in 1950, the National Council of Churches continues the work of several predecessor ecumenical organizations dating back to the early 20th century. The Council's member communions include more than 40 million individuals across over 100,000 congregations nationwide. As the most inclusive ecumenical body in the United States, the NCC works to promote unity among Christians while respecting the distinctive identities of its diverse member churches.

## Historical Development

### Ecumenical Predecessors (1908-1950)

The NCC emerged from several earlier cooperative Christian movements:

- **Federal Council of Churches (1908)**: Formed to address social issues from a united Christian perspective
- **International Council of Religious Education (1922)**: Focused on coordinating Sunday School curricula
- **Foreign Missions Conference (1893)**: Coordinated Protestant overseas mission work
- **Home Missions Council (1908)**: Coordinated domestic mission work
- **National Protestant Council on Higher Education (1911)**: Addressed Christian higher education

These and other cooperative bodies merged in 1950 to form the National Council of Churches, creating a more comprehensive ecumenical structure.

### Formation and Early Growth (1950-1965)

The NCC was officially constituted in November 1950 in Cleveland, Ohio, with 25 member denominations. During its early years, the Council:

- Developed the widely used Revised Standard Version of the Bible (1952)
- Established cooperative broadcasting ventures
- Coordinated relief and development work
- Addressed racial justice during the early Civil Rights era
- Facilitated unprecedented ecumenical dialogue

### Social Engagement Period (1965-1990)

During this era, the NCC became increasingly involved in social issues:

- Strong advocacy during the Civil Rights Movement
- Opposition to the Vietnam War
- Support for economic justice initiatives
- Addressing environmental concerns
- Engagement with international human rights

This period also saw increasing tensions with more conservative Christians who viewed the NCC as too politically progressive.

### Restructuring and Renewal (1990-Present)

Facing financial challenges and changing religious demographics, the NCC underwent significant restructuring:

- Reduction in staff and programmatic scope
- Refocused mission on core ecumenical concerns
- Relocation from the "God Box" in New York to more modest facilities
- Development of new models of ecumenical cooperation
- Renewed emphasis on faith formation and Christian unity

## Organization and Structure

### Governance

The NCC is governed according to the following structure:

- **Governing Board**: Representatives from all member communions
- **Presidium**: Composed of heads of communion from member churches
- **President/General Secretary**: Chief executive officer
- **Committees and Commissions**: Address specific areas of concern
- **Convening Tables**: Gather around shared interests and ministries

Decisions are made through a deliberative process that respects the diversity of theological perspectives among member churches.

### Membership

Current membership includes 38 member communions representing:

- Mainline Protestant denominations (Presbyterian, Lutheran, Episcopal, Methodist)
- Historic Peace Churches (Quakers, Brethren, Mennonite)
- Orthodox jurisdictions (Greek Orthodox, Orthodox Church in America)
