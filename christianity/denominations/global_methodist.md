The Global Methodist Church (GMC) is a Methodist denomination officially launched on May 1, 2022. It emerged as a conservative alternative to the United Methodist Church following long-standing theological debates over human sexuality, biblical authority, and doctrinal fidelity. The denomination represents one of the most significant realignments in American Methodism since the 19th century.

## Origins and Formation

The GMC was formed after decades of increasing tension within the United Methodist Church, particularly regarding LGBTQ+ inclusion and marriage equality. After the UMC's 2019 Special General Conference affirmed traditional positions on marriage and ordination, progressive resistance intensified. When the Protocol of Reconciliation and Grace Through Separation was proposed in 2020 (but later stalled due to pandemic-related delays), conservative Methodist leaders began planning for a new denomination.

The Wesleyan Covenant Association served as the primary organizing body behind the formation of the GMC, with significant input from groups like Good News, the Confessing Movement, and the Institute on Religion and Democracy.

## Theological Distinctives

The Global Methodist Church positions itself as maintaining historic Wesleyan theology with several key emphases:

- **Biblical Authority**: Affirming the Bible as the inspired, authoritative Word of God and the primary rule for faith and practice
- **Traditional Marriage**: Defining marriage exclusively as between one man and one woman
- **Wesleyan Soteriology**: Emphasizing personal salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, sanctification, and holiness
- **Historic Creeds**: Strong commitment to the Apostles' Creed, Nicene Creed, and other historic Christian formulations
- **Connectionalism**: Maintaining a connectional polity while reducing bureaucracy compared to the UMC

## Structure and Governance

The GMC maintains an episcopal form of government with some significant modifications from the UMC model:

- **Transitional Leadership Council**: Initially guided the denomination until its first convening conference
- **Bishops**: Serve for limited terms rather than lifetime appointments
- **Streamlined Structure**: Fewer boards and agencies than the UMC
- **Local Church Autonomy**: Greater property rights and decision-making for local congregations
- **Simplified Book of Discipline**: More concise governing document with clearer theological boundaries

## Global Presence

While initially strongest in the United States, particularly in the Southeast and Midwest regions, the GMC has attracted congregations and conferences from:

- Africa (especially Nigeria, Kenya, and parts of central Africa)
- Eastern Europe
- The Philippines
- Parts of Latin America

## Challenges and Controversies

The GMC has faced several challenges in its formation and early existence:

- **Disaffiliation Process**: Complex and sometimes contentious legal processes for congregations leaving the UMC
- **Property Disputes**: Disagreements over church property and assets during transitions
- **Identity Formation**: Establishing a distinct identity beyond being "not the UMC"
- **Balancing Global Voices**: Ensuring proportional representation from outside North America
- **Creating New Infrastructure**: Building denominational systems from scratch while supporting transitioning churches
