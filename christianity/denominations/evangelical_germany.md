# German Evangelicalism

![German Evangelicalism](../images/evangelical_germany.jpg)

German Evangelicalism (German: *Evangelische Kirche*) refers primarily to the Protestant church bodies that emerged from the Reformation in German-speaking lands, comprising both Lutheran and Reformed traditions which have largely united under common ecclesiastical structures. Unlike English usage where "evangelical" often designates conservative Protestant groups, the German term encompasses mainstream state and regional Protestant churches with a range of theological positions. German Evangelicalism has played a pivotal role in Protestant Christianity worldwide, shaping theological discourse, academic biblical scholarship, and church-state relations across Europe and beyond.

## Historical Development

### Reformation Origins
German Evangelicalism began with Martin Luther's reforming work in Wittenberg in the early 16th century, which sparked a broad movement challenging Roman Catholic theology and practice. While Luther's influence dominated in northern German territories, Reformed churches inspired by Zwingli and Calvin established themselves in western and southwestern regions.

### Territorial Churches
Following the 1555 Peace of Augsburg and later the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the principle of *cuius regio, eius religio* ("whose realm, his religion") established the right of rulers to determine the confession of their territories. This led to the development of state-sponsored territorial churches (*Landeskirchen*) rather than a unified national church.

### Union Movement
Beginning in Prussia in 1817 under King Frederick William III, many Lutheran and Reformed churches merged to form United Evangelical churches (*Evangelische Kirche der Union*). This union movement spread to other regions, though some Lutheran churches maintained their confessional independence.

### Church Under Nazism
During the Third Reich (1933-1945), German Protestant churches faced the challenge of the Nazi-aligned "German Christian" movement and state pressure. The Confessing Church (*Bekennende Kirche*), led by figures like Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Niem√∂ller, emerged as a resistance movement upholding traditional Christian doctrine against Nazi influence.

### Post-War Developments
After World War II, German Evangelicalism reorganized with the formation of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) in 1948, which united most regional Protestant churches. Churches in East Germany operated under communist restrictions until reunification in 1990 brought the eastern and western church bodies back together.

## Ecclesiastical Structure

### Regional Church Bodies
German Evangelicalism operates primarily through twenty regional churches (*Landeskirchen*), each with its own distinct territory, traditions, and governance. These include united, Lutheran, and Reformed churches, though most are united in character.

### The EKD
The Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) serves as an umbrella federation of the regional churches, providing coordination, representation, and cooperation while respecting the autonomy of its member churches. It is governed by a synod, a council, and chaired by an elected bishop or president.

### United, Lutheran, and Reformed Distinctions
Within the EKD structure:
- United churches combine Lutheran and Reformed traditions
- Lutheran churches maintain traditional Lutheran confessional documents
- Reformed churches uphold Calvinist theological principles
- All recognize each other's ministries and sacraments despite theological differences

### Church and State Relations
Unlike the American separation model, German Evangelicalism maintains a "cooperative separation" with the state. Regional churches have public corporation status, and the state collects church taxes (*Kirchensteuer*) from registered members on behalf of the churches.

## Theological Traditions

### Liberal Protestant Legacy
German Evangelicalism has been significantly shaped by 19th-century liberal Protestant scholarship, including historical-critical approaches to biblical interpretation and theological modernism. Influential figures included Friedrich Schleiermacher, Adolf von Harnack, and Rudolf Bultmann.

### Confessional Movements
In response to theological liberalism, confessional movements emphasizing traditional Lutheran and Reformed theology emerged. These include the Confessional Church Movement (*Bekenntnisbewegung*) and various pietistic renewal groups.

### Barthian Influence
The "dialectical theology" of Karl Barth and others provided a theological alternative to both liberalism and fundamentalism, emphasizing God's transcendence and the centrality of divine revelation in Christ. This approach remains influential in German theological education.

### Contemporary Theological Diversity
Modern German Evangelicalism encompasses a wide spectrum of theological positions, from progressive to conservative, with ongoing debates regarding biblical interpretation, ethical issues, and interreligious dialogue.

## Contemporary Expressions

### Worship Life
German Evangelical churches typically follow a liturgical worship pattern based on Luther's German Mass or Reformed liturgical traditions. While traditional hymns and liturgical forms remain central, contemporary worship elements have been incorporated in many congregations.

### Public Engagement
German Evangelicalism maintains a strong voice in public discourse on social, ethical, and political issues, issuing statements through the EKD and regional church leadership on matters ranging from refugee policy to bioethics.

### Diaconal Work
Practical social ministry through diaconal institutions represents a major aspect of German Evangelicalism's public presence. Diakonie Deutschland, the social welfare organization of German Protestant churches, is one of the largest welfare organizations in the country.

### Ecumenical Relations
German Evangelical churches actively participate in ecumenical dialogues with Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and other Protestant churches, both domestically and internationally, often taking leadership roles in the World Council of Churches and other ecumenical bodies.

## Challenges and Prospects

### Membership Decline
Like many European churches, German Evangelicalism faces significant membership decline due to secularization, demographic changes, and disaffiliation. Church membership has dropped from about 42% of the German population in 1990 to around 25% today.

### Financial Adjustments
Declining membership has led to reduced church tax revenue, prompting structural reforms, church building closures, and ministry consolidation within regional churches.

### Theological Identity
German Evangelicalism continues to navigate tensions between maintaining historical Protestant distinctives while engaging contemporary culture and addressing modern ethical questions.

### Global Relationships
While maintaining its distinctive character, German Evangelicalism increasingly engages with global Christianity, particularly with growing churches in the Global South, seeking to balance its European theological heritage with new contextual expressions of faith.
