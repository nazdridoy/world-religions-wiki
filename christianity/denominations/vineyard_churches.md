# Vineyard Churches

![Vineyard worship service](vineyard_churches.jpg)

The Vineyard Church movement is a network of evangelical churches that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, known for blending evangelical theology with charismatic practices in what they call "empowered evangelicalism." Founded by John Wimber after his departure from Calvary Chapel, the movement is characterized by its contemporary worship music, practical teaching, emphasis on the present work of the Holy Spirit, and commitment to church planting. The Vineyard promotes a "radical middle" theological position that balances Word and Spirit, emphasizing the Kingdom of God as already present but not yet fully realized. With over 2,400 churches in more than 95 countries, the Vineyard has become influential in both charismatic renewal and contemporary worship music.
