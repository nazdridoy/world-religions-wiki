# Old Believers

![Old Believers](old_believers.jpg)

The Old Believers (Russian: Старове́ры or Старообря́дцы, Starovery or Staroobryadtsy) represent a collection of traditionalist Orthodox Christian groups that separated from the official Russian Orthodox Church following the ecclesiastical reforms of Patriarch Nikon in the mid-17th century. Rejecting innovations in liturgical practice, texts, and ritual, Old Believers maintained what they considered the authentic traditions of Russian Orthodoxy against state-enforced changes. Despite centuries of persecution, exile, and marginalization, Old Believer communities preserved distinctive liturgical practices, cultural traditions, and religious art forms. With an estimated 1-2 million adherents worldwide today, primarily in Russia, Eastern Europe, the Baltic states, North and South America, and Australia, Old Believers remain a living testament to religious conviction and cultural preservation in the face of overwhelming opposition.
