# New Monasticism

![New Monastic community gathering](new_monasticism.jpg)

New Monasticism represents a contemporary Christian movement characterized by intentional communities seeking to embody ancient monastic practices within modern contexts. Emerging primarily in Protestant and post-denominational settings since the late 20th century, New Monasticism is marked by commitments to shared life, spiritual disciplines, social justice, and presence in marginalized neighborhoods. While drawing inspiration from traditional Catholic and Orthodox monasticism, these communities adapt monastic practices for lay practitioners often living in urban settings. Neither a denomination nor a formal organization, New Monasticism functions as a network of independent communities united by common values and a desire to integrate contemplation and activism as a witness against individualistic and consumer-oriented expressions of Christianity.
