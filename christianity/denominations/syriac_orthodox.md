# Syriac Orthodox Church

![Syriac Orthodox Church](syriac_orthodox.jpg)

The Syriac Orthodox Church (officially the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch) is one of the most ancient Christian communities, tracing its origins to the earliest Christian presence in Antioch where "the disciples were first called Christians" (Acts 11:26). As a member of the Oriental Orthodox communion, it maintains a distinctive theological position, liturgical tradition, and cultural heritage deeply rooted in Semitic Christianity. The church preserves the use of Syriac (a dialect of Aramaic similar to the language Jesus spoke) in its liturgy and theological expression. Despite centuries of persecution and declining numbers in its Middle Eastern homeland, the church has maintained an unbroken succession of patriarchs from the Apostolic era and has established growing diaspora communities worldwide. With approximately 5 million adherents globally, the Syriac Orthodox Church represents one of the most significant living links to the earliest expressions of Christianity.
