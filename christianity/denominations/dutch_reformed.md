# Dutch Reformed Church

![Dutch Reformed Church building](dutch_reformed.jpg)

The Dutch Reformed Church (Nederlandse Hervormde Kerk) represents one of the most significant branches of Reformed Protestantism, emerging from the 16th-century Protestant Reformation in the Netherlands. Deeply influenced by the theological perspectives of John Calvin and shaped by its unique Dutch context, this tradition played a foundational role in the religious, cultural, and political development of the Netherlands and later spread globally through Dutch colonial expansion. Characterized by its Calvinist theology, presbyterian governance, and emphasis on covenantal theology, the Dutch Reformed tradition has evolved through multiple denominational expressions while maintaining core theological distinctives. Today, its legacy continues through various denominations worldwide, including the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, the Reformed Church in America, and various conservative Dutch Reformed bodies.
