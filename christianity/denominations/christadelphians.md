# Christadelphians

![Christadelphian meeting hall](christadelphians.jpg)

The Christadelphians are a distinctive Christian denomination founded in the 19th century by John Thomas, who developed a unique theological system emphasizing a return to the beliefs of 1st-century Christianity as he understood them. The name "Christadelphian" means "Brothers and Sisters in Christ." Distinguished by their non-trinitarian theology, literal interpretation of Scripture, lay leadership, rejection of military service, and anticipation of Christ's imminent return to establish God's Kingdom on earth, Christadelphians have maintained a distinct identity outside mainstream Christianity. With approximately 50,000 members worldwide organized into autonomous ecclesias (congregations), they maintain a commitment to Bible study, doctrinal purity, and separation from both political involvement and what they consider the theological corruptions of mainstream Christianity.
