# The Episcopal Church

![The Episcopal Church](episcopal_church.jpg)

The Episcopal Church is the principal American expression of Anglicanism, representing a unique blend of Catholic and Protestant traditions. With approximately 1.8 million members across 6,400 congregations, it maintains a significant presence as a mainline Protestant denomination in the United States, with additional dioceses in Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Taiwan. Known for its liturgical worship, intellectual openness, and progressive social positions, The Episcopal Church embodies the "middle way" (via media) approach characteristic of the wider Anglican Communion, balancing tradition with innovation in both theology and practice.
