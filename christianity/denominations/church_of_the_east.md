# Church of the East

![Church of the East](church_of_the_east.jpg)

The Church of the East, also known as the Assyrian Church of the East or historically as the Persian Church or Nestorian Church, represents one of the most ancient Christian traditions. Developing in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq and Iran) and along the Silk Road, this church expanded across Asia before experiencing periods of dramatic decline. Distinguished by its unique Christological position, East Syriac liturgical tradition, and remarkable missionary history, the Church of the East developed largely outside Byzantine and Western Roman spheres of influence. Today, after periods of persecution and diaspora, it continues as a living witness to an ancient Christian tradition with approximately 400,000 adherents worldwide.
