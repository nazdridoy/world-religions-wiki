# House Church Movement

![House church gathering](house_church.jpg)

The House Church Movement represents a return to small, home-based Christian communities that meet in private residences rather than dedicated religious buildings. Drawing inspiration from both early church practices and contemporary critiques of institutional Christianity, house churches emphasize participatory worship, mutual ministry, relational discipleship, and simplicity. Neither a denomination nor a unified organization, this diverse movement spans theological traditions from conservative evangelical to progressive emergent expressions. With significant growth in regions facing persecution and in post-Christian Western contexts, house churches offer a decentralized, flexible approach to Christian community that challenges traditional ecclesiastical hierarchies while emphasizing the priesthood of all believers and direct spiritual experience in everyday settings.
