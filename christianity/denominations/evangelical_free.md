# Evangelical Free Church

![Evangelical Free Church](../images/evangelical_free.jpg)

The Evangelical Free Church is a Protestant denomination with Scandinavian roots that emerged from pietistic revival movements in the late 19th century. The denomination consists of autonomous congregations united by a commitment to the authority of Scripture and evangelical theology while maintaining freedom in non-essential matters. Today, the Evangelical Free Church of America (EFCA) includes approximately 1,500 churches across the United States, with sister organizations in other countries, making it a significant evangelical denomination known for its theological conservatism and congregational governance.

## Historical Development

### Scandinavian Origins
The Evangelical Free Church emerged among Swedish and Norwegian-Danish immigrants to North America in the late 19th century. These immigrants had been influenced by pietistic revivals in their homelands that emphasized personal faith and biblical authority over state-church formalism.

### American Formation
Formed officially in 1950 through the merger of the Swedish Evangelical Free Church (organized in 1884) and the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Free Church Association (organized in 1912), the unified denomination represented a consolidation of like-minded congregationalist bodies with similar theological positions.

### Growth Period
The post-World War II era saw significant growth for the EFCA, as it expanded beyond its Scandinavian ethnic roots to become a more mainstream evangelical denomination. This growth accelerated in the 1970s-1990s through intentional church planting efforts.

## Theological Distinctives

### Statement of Faith
The EFCA maintains a statement of faith focusing on core evangelical beliefs, including:
- The inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture
- The Trinity
- The deity of Christ
- Substitutionary atonement
- Salvation by grace through faith
- The necessity of personal conversion
- The physical return of Christ

### Free Church Principles
The denomination upholds several key "free church" principles:
- Local church autonomy
- Congregational governance
- Believer's baptism
- Freedom in non-essential doctrines
- Priesthood of all believers

### Middle Position
The EFCA is often characterized as occupying a middle position between fundamentalism and theological liberalism, maintaining doctrinal rigor while avoiding extremes of separatism or accommodation to secular culture.

## Organizational Structure

### Congregational Governance
Each EFCA church is self-governing, calling its own pastors and determining its own programs, budget, and ministry priorities. Church properties are owned locally rather than by the denomination.

### Association for Support
The denomination functions as an association of autonomous churches that voluntarily cooperate for mutual encouragement, accountability, and shared ministry initiatives.

### District Structure
The EFCA in North America is organized into regional districts that provide resources, guidance, and fellowship opportunities to member churches while respecting local church autonomy.

## Contemporary Ministry

### Educational Institutions
Trinity International University in Deerfield, Illinois, serves as the denomination's flagship educational institution, including Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, which has educated influential evangelical leaders across denominational lines.

### Global Mission
EFCA ReachGlobal (formerly EFCA International Mission) coordinates international mission efforts across more than 90 countries, focusing on church planting, leadership development, and holistic ministry approaches.

### Church Multiplication
The denomination maintains a strategic focus on planting new churches, with initiatives aimed at multiethnic and urban contexts, as well as revitalizing established congregations.

## Contemporary Positions

### Theological Conservatism
The EFCA maintains theologically conservative positions on core doctrines, revising its statement of faith in 2008 to clarify its continued commitment to premillennialism and the inerrancy of Scripture.

### Complementarianism
The denomination officially holds to a complementarian view of gender roles, though individual churches have some latitude in how this is applied in local contexts.

### Cultural Engagement
While maintaining traditional evangelical moral positions, the EFCA encourages thoughtful engagement with contemporary culture rather than rigid separatism.
