The African Methodist Episcopal Church is a historically Black Protestant denomination with Methodist theology and episcopal governance. Founded in 1816 by Richard Allen in Philadelphia, the AME Church emerged from the struggle against racism within American Methodism and has grown to approximately 2.5 million members across more than 7,000 congregations worldwide. As the first independent Black denomination in the United States, the AME Church pioneered Black religious self-determination while maintaining a theological balance of spiritual renewal and social justice that continues to shape its distinctive witness in contemporary society.
