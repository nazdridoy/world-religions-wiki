Churches of Christ represent a conservative branch of the Restoration Movement, distinguished by their commitment to restoring New Testament Christianity through literal biblical interpretation, a cappella worship, congregational autonomy, and an emphasis on baptism by immersion for the forgiveness of sins.

## Historical Development

### Emergence as a Distinct Movement

- **1800s**: Developed as part of the broader Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement
- **1832**: Alexander Campbell's "Millennial Harbinger" and Barton W. Stone's "Christian Messenger" promoted restoration ideals
- **1849**: Controversy over missionary societies began dividing the movement
- **1880s-1900s**: Increasing disputes over instrumental music in worship
- **1906**: Formal recognition of division when Churches of Christ were listed separately in the U.S. Religious Census
- **1920s-1940s**: Formation of distinctive identity under leaders like David Lipscomb and J.W. McGarvey

### Modern Development

- **1950s-1960s**: Rapid growth in the post-WWII era, particularly in the American South
- **1970s-present**: Debates over institutionalism and fellowship issues
- **1990s-present**: Some congregations adopting more contemporary approaches while others maintain traditional practices
- **2000s-present**: Diminishing emphasis on sectarianism among some congregations; continued debates over women's roles

## Core Beliefs and Practices

### Distinctive Theological Positions

- **Biblical Authority**: Strict adherence to the New Testament as the only guide for church practice
- **Baptism**: Immersion of adults for the remission of sins as essential for salvation
- **Lord's Supper**: Weekly communion observed every Sunday
- **Worship**: A cappella singing only; rejection of instrumental music based on New Testament silence
- **Church Organization**: Autonomous congregations led by elders and deacons; no denominational hierarchy
- **Soteriology**: Emphasis on obedient faith; salvation through grace but requiring human response
- **Eschatology**: Generally amillennial; varied views on end times

### Worship Practices

- **Sunday Assembly**: Centered around five acts of worship derived from scripture:
  1. A cappella singing
  2. Prayer
  3. Communion (Lord's Supper)
  4. Giving (collection)
  5. Preaching/teaching
- **Simplicity**: Plain worship spaces, often without religious symbols or imagery
- **Congregational Singing**: Four-part harmony common, without instrumental accompaniment
- **Scripture Reading**: Emphasis on public reading of Bible texts

## Organizational Structure

- **Congregational Autonomy**: Each congregation is self-governing
- **Eldership**: Plurality of elders (also called bishops or pastors) oversee each congregation
- **Deacons**: Serve under elders in various ministries
- **Preachers/Ministers**: Usually hired by congregations, without ordination in the traditional sense
- **No Central Headquarters**: No formal denominational organization or ecclesiastical authority
- **Cooperation**: Voluntary association between congregations for missions, education, and benevolence

## Educational Institutions

Churches of Christ maintain several colleges and universities that have played a significant role in shaping the movement:

- **Abilene Christian University** (Texas)
