# Anglicanism

Anglicanism represents a distinctive tradition within Christianity that emerged from the English Reformation of the 16th century. As a communion of churches with approximately 85 million members worldwide, Anglicanism occupies a unique middle position in Christianity, often described as a "via media" (middle way) between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Distinguished by its retention of Catholic order and liturgy while embracing Protestant theology, Anglicanism has evolved into a global family of churches characterized by diverse expressions, shared history, and common patterns of worship centered on the Book of Common Prayer tradition. Today, the Anglican Communion spans 165 countries through 42 autonomous provinces, maintaining unity through common heritage rather than centralized authority.
