The Lausanne Movement is a global evangelical network focused on world evangelization and holistic mission. Emerging from the 1974 International Congress on World Evangelization held in Lausanne, Switzerland, it has become one of the most significant platforms for evangelical cooperation and theological reflection on mission in the contemporary world. While not a denomination itself, the Lausanne Movement connects leaders, organizations, and churches across denominational lines through its congresses, forums, working groups, and publications, influencing evangelical approaches to mission, evangelism, and social engagement globally.

## Origins and Development

The Lausanne Movement has developed through several key stages:

- Initiated through the vision of evangelist Billy Graham and British theologian John Stott

- Second Lausanne Congress in Manila, Philippines (1989), producing the Manila Manifesto
- Regional consultations and issue-specific forums throughout the 1980s-2000s
- Cape Town 2010: Third Lausanne Congress bringing together 4,000 leaders from 198 countries
