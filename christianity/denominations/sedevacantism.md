# Sedevacantism

![Sedevacantist chapel](sedevacantism.jpg)

Sedevacantism (from the Latin *sede vacante*, meaning "the seat being vacant") is a position held by a minority of traditionalist Catholics who claim that the papal seat has been vacant since the death of Pope Pius XII in 1958 or John XXIII in 1963. Sedevacantists reject the authority and legitimacy of the post-Vatican II popes, considering them heretics who have departed from Catholic doctrine and thus invalidly hold office. While representing a small fraction of those identifying as Catholic, sedevacantist groups maintain a visible presence, especially in North America and parts of Europe, operating independent chapels, publishing houses, and seminaries that seek to preserve what they believe to be authentic pre-Vatican II Catholicism.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early Development (1960s-1970s)

- Emerged as a reaction to the changes introduced by the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965)
- Initial questioning of papal authority during Paul VI's papacy (1963-1978)
- Early proponents included clergy distressed by liturgical and doctrinal changes
- First formal sedevacantist positions articulated following promulgation of Novus Ordo Mass (1969)
- Early theoretical development by theologians like Fr. Joaquín Sáenz y Arriaga in Mexico
- Formation of small scattered communities rejecting Vatican II and post-conciliar popes
- Heavily influenced by traditional Catholic theology of the papacy and heresy
- Divergence from other traditionalist groups who accepted papal legitimacy despite criticisms

### Development and Expansion (1980s-1990s)

- Growth of organized sedevacantist communities, particularly in the United States
- Emergence of competing sedevacantist bishops with claimed apostolic succession
- Theological refinement of position through books and periodicals
- Development of various theories regarding the vacancy of the papal office
- Establishment of sedevacantist seminaries and religious communities
- Increasing distance from mainstream Catholicism and other traditionalist groups
- Internal divisions over theological and jurisdictional questions
- Growth of internet presence spreading sedevacantist arguments

### Contemporary Developments (2000s-Present)

- Continued existence as small but committed minority within traditionalist Catholicism
- Slight growth through conversions and modest internal population growth
- Ongoing theological debates with other Catholic traditionalist movements
- Development of more nuanced positions on complex canonical questions
- Impact of Pope Benedict XVI's papacy and subsequent resignation
- Response to Pope Francis and perception of accelerating changes
- Generational transition as movement passes to those with no direct memory of pre-Vatican II Church
- Challenges of maintaining institutional viability with limited numbers

## Theological Positions

### Core Theological Premise

- Application of traditional Catholic teaching that a heretic cannot validly hold ecclesiastical office
- Belief that Vatican II and subsequent papal teachings contain heresies
- Appeal to bull *Cum Ex Apostolatus Officio* of Pope Paul IV (1559)
- Assertion that apparent popes since Pius XII or John XXIII were never truly popes
- View that the Church is in an extended period of crisis predicted in Scripture
- Claim to represent the true Catholic Church during this extraordinary situation
- Rejection of *una cum* Masses (those mentioning the current pope in the Canon)
- Belief in visible nature of the Church despite apparent absence of pope

### Sedevacantist Arguments

- Alleged contradictions between pre-Vatican II teaching and post-Vatican II reforms
- Religious liberty as contradicting traditional Catholic doctrine
- Ecumenism as undermining the Church's unique claims
- Changes to sacramental forms rendering them possibly invalid
- Liturgical reforms seen as Protestant-influenced or invalid
- Canonical arguments about papal elections and qualifications
- Theological arguments about the nature and effects of heresy
- Historical precedents of papal claimants later judged antipopes

### Variations of Sedevacantist Position

- **Total Sedevacantism**: All post-Pius XII or post-John XXIII popes invalid
- **Partial Sedevacantism**: Some post-Vatican II popes valid, others not
- **Sedeprivationism**: Post-Vatican II popes materially but not formally popes
- **Conclavism**: Claim that valid alternative popes have been elected
- **Home Alone**: Rejection of all currently available clergy as compromised
- **Material Pope Thesis**: Pope validly elected but prevented from exercising authority
- **Cassiciacum Thesis**: Pope has legitimate election but lacks authority due to heresy
- **Resignationism**: Theory that Pope Benedict XVI's resignation was invalid

### Critique of Vatican II

- Rejection of Council as containing doctrinal errors and ambiguities
- Specific criticism of *Dignitatis Humanae* on religious liberty
- Objection to *Nostra Aetate* on relations with non-Christian religions
- Criticism of *Lumen Gentium*'s ecclesiology
- Rejection of *Unitatis Redintegratio* on ecumenism
