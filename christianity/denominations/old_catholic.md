# Old Catholic Church

![Old Catholic Church](../images/old_catholic_church.jpg)

The Old Catholic Church represents a group of autonomous Christian churches that broke away from the Roman Catholic Church primarily in response to the declaration of papal infallibility at the First Vatican Council in 1870. While maintaining Catholic traditions, liturgy, and sacraments, Old Catholics reject papal supremacy and certain post-Reformation Catholic doctrines.
