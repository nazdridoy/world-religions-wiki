# Eastern Catholic Churches

![Eastern Catholic Church](eastern_catholic_church.jpg)

The Eastern Catholic Churches comprise 23 distinct, self-governing (sui juris) particular churches in full communion with the Pope and the worldwide Catholic Church. While recognizing papal authority, these churches maintain their own Eastern liturgical, theological, spiritual, and canonical traditions, many of which are shared with Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox churches. With approximately 18 million members worldwide, Eastern Catholic Churches represent a unique bridge between Eastern and Western Christianity, embodying the Catholic Church's diversity while maintaining its unity.
