# Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church

![Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church](ethiopian_orthodox.jpg)

The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church represents one of the oldest continuous Christian traditions in the world, dating back to the 4th century. As a member of the Oriental Orthodox communion, it has maintained distinctive theological positions, liturgical practices, and cultural expressions shaped by Ethiopia's unique historical context. The word "Tewahedo" means "unified" or "made one," reflecting the church's non-Chalcedonian Christology which maintains that Christ's divine and human natures are united in one nature without separation, confusion, or alteration. With approximately 36 million adherents primarily in Ethiopia and Eritrea (before the ecclesiastical split), the church embodies a remarkable synthesis of biblical, Jewish, and indigenous African elements in its worship, calendar, and spiritual life.
