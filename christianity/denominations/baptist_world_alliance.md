# Baptist World Alliance

![Baptist World Alliance gathering](bwa_gathering.jpg)

The Baptist World Alliance (BWA) is a global fellowship of Baptist churches and organizations established in 1905 in London, England. Representing over 49 million baptized believers and a community of more than 176,000 churches worldwide, the BWA connects 246 member bodies from 128 countries and territories. Unlike a denominational structure with authority over member bodies, it functions as a voluntary fellowship promoting unity, mission cooperation, human rights advocacy, and aid distribution. The BWA provides a platform for global Baptist cooperation while respecting the autonomy of member organizations and churches, embodying the Baptist principles of local church independence within a framework of fellowship and mutual support.
