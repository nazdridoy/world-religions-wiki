The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a Protestant Christian denomination distinguished by its observance of Saturday as the Sabbath, its emphasis on the imminent Second Coming of Christ, and its holistic approach to human health and well-being. Founded formally in 1863, the church has grown to approximately 22 million baptized members worldwide, operating one of the largest Protestant educational and healthcare systems globally.

## Origins and Development

The Seventh-day Adventist Church emerged from the Millerite movement of the 1840s in the United States. Key developments include:

- The Great Disappointment of 1844, when William Miller's prediction of Christ's return failed to materialize
- Formation of a small group of Millerites who reinterpreted the 1844 date as the beginning of Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary
- Leadership of James and Ellen G. White, Joseph Bates, and J.N. Andrews
- Ellen G. White's role as a prophetess providing spiritual guidance through her visions
- Formal organization as the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists in 1863
- Development of health reform principles and establishment of the first sanitarium in 1866
- Expansion of educational institutions beginning with Battle Creek College in 1874
- Growth of international missionary efforts from the 1870s onward
- Significant organizational restructuring in 1901-1903
- Theological developments through the 20th century while maintaining distinctive doctrines
- Emergence as a global church with majority membership in the Global South

## Core Beliefs

Seventh-day Adventist theology combines Protestant Christianity with several distinctive doctrines:

- **Sabbath Observance**: Recognition of Saturday (the seventh day) as the biblical Sabbath
- **Second Advent**: Expectation of Christ's literal, visible, and imminent return
- **Great Controversy**: Cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan as the context for understanding history
- **Sanctuary Doctrine**: Christ's ongoing high priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary
- **State of the Dead**: Belief in "soul sleep" rather than immediate afterlife
- **Spirit of Prophecy**: Recognition of Ellen G. White's prophetic gift
- **Health Message**: Emphasis on wholistic health including dietary guidelines
- **Three Angels' Messages**: End-time proclamation from Revelation 14
- **Investigative Judgment**: Pre-advent judgment beginning in 1844
- **Conditional Immortality**: Eventual annihilation rather than eternal torment for the wicked

While maintaining these distinctives, the church affirms fundamental Christian doctrines including the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, and the authority of Scripture.

## Structure and Governance

The Seventh-day Adventist Church operates with a representative form of church governance:

- **General Conference**: Worldwide administrative body headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland
- **Divisions**: 13 regional subdivisions of the General Conference
- **Union Conferences/Missions**: Regional administrative units
- **Local Conferences/Missions**: Primary administrative units overseeing local churches
- **Local Churches**: Congregations led by pastors and local elected boards
- **Representative System**: Decision-making through elected delegates at various levels
- **Ordination of Ministers**: Following period of training and evaluation
- **Position on Women's Ordination**: Ongoing discussion with regional variations
- **Centralized Doctrinal Authority**: Fundamental Beliefs established by General Conference

The church maintains a global identity while allowing some contextual adaptation in different cultural settings.
