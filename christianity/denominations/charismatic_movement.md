![Charismatic Worship](../../images/charismatic_worship.jpg)

The Charismatic Movement represents a significant renewal movement within Christianity that emphasizes the active presence of the Holy Spirit, spiritual gifts, and experiential faith. Beginning in the 1960s, it spread across denominational boundaries, bringing Pentecostal experiences into mainline Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox churches while creating new independent congregations and networks. With an estimated 500 million adherents globally, the Charismatic Movement constitutes one of the fastest-growing segments of Christianity in the 20th and 21st centuries.
