# Neo-Evangelicalism

![Neo-Evangelicalism](../images/neo_evangelical.jpg)

Neo-Evangelicalism (often simply called "evangelicalism" in contemporary contexts) emerged in the mid-20th century as a movement seeking to reposition conservative Protestantism in American society. Led initially by theologians like Harold Ockenga, Carl F.H. Henry, and Billy Graham, neo-evangelicalism sought a middle path between the separatist fundamentalism of the early 20th century and the perceived theological liberalism of mainline denominations.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early Formation
Neo-evangelicalism began formally in 1942 with the formation of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE), representing a conscious break from fundamentalist separatism. The movement gained momentum in the post-World War II era when Billy Graham's crusades reached millions and Christianity Today magazine (founded 1956) provided intellectual leadership.

### Theological Positioning
The movement maintained core evangelical beliefs (biblical authority, salvation through Christ alone, the necessity of personal conversion, and active evangelism) while engaging more openly with broader society and scholarship. Neo-evangelicals sought to maintain orthodox theology while rejecting what they saw as the anti-intellectual and culturally isolated stance of fundamentalism.

### Institutional Expression
Neo-evangelicalism found expression through influential institutions including:
- Fuller Theological Seminary (founded 1947)
- Wheaton College
- Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
- Christianity Today magazine
- Evangelistic organizations like Youth for Christ and Campus Crusade for Christ (now Cru)

## Key Characteristics

### Intellectual Engagement
Unlike earlier fundamentalism, neo-evangelicalism embraced scholarly engagement with modern thought, producing significant works in theology, philosophy, and biblical studies. Leaders emphasized the importance of Christian scholarship and intellectual credibility.

### Social Concern
While maintaining emphasis on personal conversion, neo-evangelicals increasingly recognized the social dimensions of the gospel. This led to growing involvement in addressing issues like poverty, racism, and human rights alongside traditional evangelistic efforts.

### Cultural Relevance
Neo-evangelicals sought more constructive engagement with culture rather than withdrawal. This eventually manifested in contemporary worship styles, media engagement, and efforts to translate Christian faith into culturally relevant forms while maintaining theological distinctives.

### Political Engagement
Initially politically diverse, neo-evangelicalism became increasingly associated with conservative politics in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s with the rise of the Religious Right and Moral Majority, though significant politically progressive evangelical voices remained.

## Contemporary Expressions

### The Evangelical Coalition
Today's evangelical landscape reflects the neo-evangelical movement's influence, with large non-denominational churches, parachurch ministries, and educational institutions carrying forward its theological and cultural priorities while adapting to contemporary contexts.

### Global Growth
The neo-evangelical approach has spread globally, contributing to explosive growth in evangelical Christianity across the Global South, combining traditional theology with contextual adaptations.

### Fragmentation and Redefinition
In recent decades, the movement has experienced significant internal tensions over issues including:
- Cultural engagement strategies
- Political alignments
- Gender roles and sexuality
- Racial justice and reconciliation
- Theological boundaries
