Calvary Chapel is an evangelical church movement with roots in the Jesus Movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Founded by Pastor Chuck Smith in Costa Mesa, California, the movement is characterized by its contemporary worship style, verse-by-verse Bible teaching, casual atmosphere, and autonomous church governance. Calvary Chapel occupies a theological middle ground between Pentecostalism and traditional evangelicalism, emphasizing both biblical teaching and the present-day work of the Holy Spirit. With thousands of affiliated churches worldwide, Calvary Chapel has become one of the most significant non-denominational Christian movements of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
