# Greek Orthodox Church

![Greek Orthodox Church](greek_orthodox.jpg)

The Greek Orthodox Church comprises several autocephalous (self-governing) churches that share a common Greek Byzantine heritage but function as distinct ecclesiastical entities. The Church of Greece serves as the predominant religious institution in Greece, while the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople exercises jurisdiction over Greek Orthodox communities in parts of Greece, Turkey, and much of the global diaspora. Additionally, the ancient Patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem maintain Greek-speaking hierarchical leadership despite serving primarily Arab Orthodox populations. These Greek Orthodox churches collectively preserve Byzantine liturgical, theological, and cultural traditions, maintaining a distinctive Greek expression of Eastern Orthodoxy while participating in the broader communion of Orthodox churches worldwide.
