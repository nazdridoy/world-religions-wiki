# Progressive Christianity

![Progressive Christianity worship gathering](progressive_christianity.jpg)

Progressive Christianity represents a theological movement and approach to the Christian faith characterized by a willingness to question tradition, acceptance of human diversity, emphasis on social justice, and environmental stewardship. Rather than a distinct denomination, it functions as a broad and inclusive orientation spanning multiple church traditions. Emerging from 19th century liberal theology and evolving through 20th century social gospel and liberation movements, Progressive Christianity distinguishes itself by interpreting scripture through historical-critical methods, emphasizing Jesus's social teachings over dogmatic formulations, and actively engaging with contemporary social issues. While maintaining core Christian elements like the centrality of Jesus and communal worship, it welcomes theological diversity, interfaith dialogue, and ongoing reformation of religious thought and practice.
