# Restorationism

![Restorationist Church](restorationist_church.jpg)

Restorationism, also known as the Restoration Movement or Primitivism, encompasses a diverse array of Christian movements united by their goal of restoring primitive Christianity by returning to what they understand as the original practices and teachings of the early church. Emerging primarily in the United States during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century, these movements rejected denominationalism and ecclesiastical traditions in favor of biblical literalism and congregational autonomy. Distinguished by their emphasis on baptism by immersion, weekly communion, congregational governance, and rejection of creeds, Restorationist groups have grown into significant religious bodies with approximately 13 million adherents worldwide. While sharing common roots, these movements have developed distinct theological emphases, organizational structures, and cultural expressions.
