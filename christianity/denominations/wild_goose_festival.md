The Wild Goose Festival is a progressive Christian gathering that emerged in 2011 as an intersection of spirituality, justice, music, and art. Named after the Celtic metaphor for the Holy Spirit, the festival represents not a denomination but rather a movement bringing together Christians from diverse traditions who share commitments to social justice, inclusivity, environmental stewardship, interfaith dialogue, and creative expressions of faith. Held annually in Hot Springs, North Carolina, the festival has become a significant gathering point for progressive and emergent expressions of Christianity in North America.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Inspiration
Wild Goose was inspired by the UK's Greenbelt Festival, which since 1974 has celebrated arts, faith, and justice. The American adaptation emerged through conversations among progressive Christian leaders, including Brian McLaren, Jim Wallis, Phyllis Tickle, and others seeking an alternative to both the religious right and secular left.

### First Gathering
The inaugural Wild Goose Festival was held in June 2011 in Shakori Hills, North Carolina, attracting approximately 1,500 participants for a four-day event featuring music, speakers, workshops, and spiritual practices outside conventional church settings.

### Development and Growth
After its initial years at Shakori Hills, the festival relocated to Hot Springs, North Carolina, in 2013. It has continued as an annual summer event, expanding its programming while maintaining its core identity as an open, inclusive gathering focused on justice, spirituality, music, and art.

## Core Values and Characteristics

Social justice forms a central concern at Wild Goose, with programming addressing:
- Racial reconciliation and anti-racism
- LGBTQ+ inclusion and rights
- Climate justice and environmental stewardship

## Festival Experience

- Multiple smaller venues hosting concurrent workshops and discussions
- Intentional spaces for prayer, meditation, and spiritual practice

- Opportunities for attendee-led sessions
- Communal art-making and ritual participation
- Emphasis on conversation and relationship-building
- Blurred boundaries between presenters and participants

The festival's location along the French Broad River in the Appalachian Mountains provides:
- Camping as the primary accommodation

- River access for swimming and recreation
- Rustic conditions emphasizing simplicity and sustainability
- Connection with creation as part of the spiritual experience

## Theological and Ecclesial Context

### Post-Evangelical Identity
Many participants and organizers come from evangelical backgrounds but have moved toward progressive theological positions while maintaining spiritual practices and biblical engagement from their evangelical roots.

### Denominational Diversity
The festival deliberately crosses denominational boundaries, drawing participants from:
- Progressive mainline Protestant traditions
- Post-evangelical and emergent communities
- Catholic and Orthodox backgrounds

### Emergent Church Connection
Wild Goose has significant connections to the Emergent Church movement (though not limited to it), sharing its emphasis on:
- Questioning traditional doctrinal formulations
- Embracing postmodern epistemological perspectives
- Valuing community and conversation over dogmatic certainty

### Interreligious Openness

## Contemporary Significance

### Alternative Christian Witness
In an American context where Christianity is often associated with conservative politics, Wild Goose offers a visible alternative Christian presence focused on justice, inclusion, and environmental stewardship.
