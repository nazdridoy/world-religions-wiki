The Methodist Church in Britain is the largest Wesleyan Methodist denomination in the United Kingdom, with approximately 164,000 members across 4,000 churches. Founded on the spiritual revival led by John Wesley in the 18th century, British Methodism represents the original context from which worldwide Methodism emerged. Historically characterized by its emphasis on personal faith, social holiness, and service to the marginalized, the denomination has played a significant role in British religious and social history. Though experiencing numerical decline in recent decades, the Methodist Church in Britain continues to exert influence through its commitment to social justice, ecumenical relationships, and thoughtful engagement with contemporary issues, while maintaining its distinctive Wesleyan theological heritage that emphasizes God's grace available to all people.
