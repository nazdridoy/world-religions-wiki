# National Baptist Convention

![National Baptist Convention church gathering](national_baptist_convention.jpg)

The National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. is one of the largest predominantly African American Christian denominations in the United States and the largest Baptist denomination among Black Americans. Founded in 1895, it emerged from the consolidation of three national Baptist conventions, uniting Black Baptists who sought religious autonomy and self-determination in the post-Reconstruction era. The National Baptist Convention has played a significant role in the spiritual life of African Americans and has been instrumental in social justice movements, particularly during the Civil Rights era. Today, it continues its mission of evangelism, education, and community service while maintaining its historic commitment to addressing the needs and concerns of the Black community in America.
