# Post-Denominationalism

![Diverse Christian Worship](post_denominational_worship.jpg)

Post-denominationalism represents a significant shift in Christian identity and organization that has emerged since the late 20th century, characterized by decreasing emphasis on traditional denominational affiliation and increasing focus on transdenominational networks, shared practices, and theological commonalities. This movement reflects broader cultural trends toward institutional skepticism, personal spiritual customization, and networked rather than hierarchical organization. While not rejecting the historical contributions of denominations, post-denominational Christianity prioritizes missional effectiveness, contextual relevance, and spiritual authenticity over denominational distinctives or loyalty. Growing from both evangelical and progressive roots, this approach has manifested in independent churches, multisite networks, house church movements, emerging church experiments, and digital faith communities. Post-denominationalism challenges traditional theological education, ministerial credentials, and ecclesiastical structures while offering possibilities for both renewed Christian unity and concerning theological incoherence.
