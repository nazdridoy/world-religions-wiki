The Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRCNA) is a Protestant Christian denomination with strong Dutch Reformed roots, approximately 230,000 members in about 1,000 congregations across the United States and Canada. Founded by Dutch immigrants in 1857, the denomination has developed from an insular ethnic church into a diverse body that balances Reformed theological tradition with contemporary engagement. The CRCNA is characterized by a robust intellectual tradition, commitment to education, strong missional focus, and a balanced approach to social engagement through a Reformed worldview.
