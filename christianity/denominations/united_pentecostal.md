![United Pentecostal Church worship service](united_pentecostal.jpg)

The United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI) is a Oneness Pentecostal denomination founded in 1945 through the merger of the Pentecostal Church Incorporated and the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ. Distinguished by its rejection of the traditional Trinity doctrine in favor of Modalism (or "Oneness" theology) and its emphasis on baptism in Jesus' name only, the UPCI represents one of the largest Apostolic Pentecostal organizations globally. The denomination is characterized by expressive worship, strict holiness standards, speaking in tongues as evidence of Spirit baptism, and a strong missionary focus. With approximately 5.2 million constituents worshipping in over 42,000 churches across 228 countries and territories, the UPCI maintains distinctive theological positions and cultural practices that set it apart from mainstream Trinitarian Pentecostalism.
