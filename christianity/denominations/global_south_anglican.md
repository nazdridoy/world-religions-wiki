The Global South Anglican movement represents a significant realignment within the worldwide Anglican Communion, consisting primarily of provinces from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This coalition of Anglican churches has emerged as a major force advocating for traditional theological positions and addressing the shifting demographic center of Anglican Christianity from the Global North to the Global South.

## Overview

The Global South Anglican movement encompasses Anglican provinces primarily from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and parts of Oceania. These provinces represent the majority of the world's estimated 85 million Anglicans, with particularly large constituencies in Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda. The movement emerged in response to theological shifts in Western Anglican churches and represents a more theologically conservative approach to Anglican Christianity, particularly regarding biblical authority, human sexuality, and traditional doctrine.

## Historical Development

### Colonial Foundations (19th-Early 20th Centuries)

The Anglican presence in the Global South began through missionary activities during the colonial era:

- British colonial expansion brought Anglicanism to Africa, Asia, and other regions
- Formation of dioceses and provinces initially under European leadership
- Development of indigenous clergy and leadership
- Growth of contextual theological education
- Foundations of national Anglican churches with ties to Canterbury

### Post-Colonial Period (1950s-1970s)

As nations gained independence, Anglican churches underwent significant transitions:

- Transfer of leadership to indigenous bishops and clergy
- Development of contextual liturgies and theological approaches
- Rapid growth in many regions, especially Africa
- Continued relationships with Western Anglican bodies through financial support
- Increased participation in global Anglican structures

### Formation of Distinct Identity (1980s-1990s)

Global South Anglican churches began developing a more distinctive identity:

- Growing theological divergence from Western Anglican liberalism
- Emergence of strong evangelical and Anglo-Catholic expressions
- Economic challenges amid rapid church growth
- Increasing confidence in articulating theological positions
- Initial concerns about Western theological developments

### Organized Movement (1997-Present)

The formal Global South movement developed through several key events:

- First South-to-South Encounter held in Kuala Lumpur (1997)
- Publication of the Kuala Lumpur Statement on sexuality and scripture
- Lambeth Conference tensions (1998) over Resolution 1.10 on sexuality
- Subsequent Global South Encounters developing organizational structures
- Formation of the Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches (GSFA)
- Provincial responses to the consecration of Gene Robinson (2003)
- Development of the Jerusalem Declaration (2008)
- Establishment of the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON)
- Growth of alternative oversight structures for traditionalist Anglicans
