# Oriental Orthodoxy

![Oriental Orthodox Church](oriental_orthodox_church.jpg)

Oriental Orthodoxy is one of the oldest Christian traditions, representing a family of churches that separated from the main body of Christianity following the Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE. With approximately 60 million adherents worldwide, primarily in Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Armenia, Syria, and India, Oriental Orthodox churches maintain distinctive theological positions, liturgical practices, and cultural expressions while sharing core Christian beliefs. Despite often being confused with Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy represents a separate communion with its own historical development, theological emphases, and ecclesiastical structures.
