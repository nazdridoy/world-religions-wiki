![Southern Baptist Convention](southern_baptist_church.jpg)

The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) is the largest Protestant denomination in the United States and the largest Baptist group in the world, with over 14 million members and approximately 47,000 churches. Founded in 1845, the SBC is known for its strong emphasis on evangelism, missions, biblical authority, congregational governance, and baptism of believers by immersion. While maintaining historical Baptist principles like religious liberty and the priesthood of all believers, the SBC has evolved into a conservative evangelical denomination with significant influence in American religious and cultural life.
