# Global Shifts in Christianity

![World Christianity Map](global_christianity_map.jpg)

Christianity has undergone dramatic demographic, theological, and cultural transformations in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that represent perhaps the most significant reshaping of the faith since the Reformation. The most profound change has been Christianity's center of gravity shifting from the Global North (Europe and North America) to the Global South (Africa, Asia, and Latin America), where the overwhelming majority of Christians now live. This "southward shift" has transformed not only where Christians reside but how Christianity is expressed, interpreted, and practiced. Alongside this geographic realignment, other significant shifts include the explosive growth of Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity, declining religious affiliation in traditionally Christian societies, the digital revolution's impact on religious practice, and changing patterns of mission and evangelism. These interrelated developments have created a more diverse, polycentric global faith with profound implications for Christianity's future trajectory.
