# Eastern Orthodoxy

![Eastern Orthodox Church](orthodox_cathedral.jpg)

Eastern Orthodoxy is the second-largest Christian denomination worldwide with approximately 220-300 million adherents, primarily in Eastern Europe, Greece, Russia, and the Middle East. Known officially as the Orthodox Catholic Church, it claims to be the original Christian Church established by Christ and the apostles, preserved through continuous and unbroken apostolic succession. Characterized by its rich liturgical tradition, distinctive theology, emphasis on mystical experience, and conciliar form of church governance, Eastern Orthodoxy represents one of the three major branches of Christianity alongside Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.
