# Anglican Church in North America

![Anglican Church in North America](acna.jpg)

The Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) is a conservative Anglican denomination formed in 2009 by former members of the Episcopal Church in the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada. With approximately 134,000 members in over 1,000 congregations across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, ACNA represents a significant realignment in North American Anglicanism. The denomination was established in response to perceived theological liberalization in mainstream Anglican provinces, particularly regarding biblical authority, Christology, and human sexuality.

## Historical Development

- Watershed moment: Consecration of Gene Robinson as first openly gay bishop in TEC in 2003
- Series of departures from TEC and Anglican Church of Canada by conservative parishes and dioceses
- Various Anglican bodies formed, including the Anglican Mission in America, Convocation of Anglicans in North America, and others
- Provincial Assembly in Bedford, Texas formed ACNA in June 2009
- Robert Duncan (former Episcopal Bishop of Pittsburgh) elected as first Archbishop
- Recognition by Global South Anglican provinces, though not officially by Canterbury

### Growth and Development
