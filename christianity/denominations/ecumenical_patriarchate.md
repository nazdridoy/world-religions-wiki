# Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople

![Ecumenical Patriarchate](ecumenical_patriarchate.jpg)

The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is the senior patriarchate of the Eastern Orthodox Church and serves as the spiritual center for approximately 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. Located in Istanbul (historically Constantinople), Turkey, the Patriarchate holds a position of primacy among the autocephalous (self-governing) Orthodox churches, exercising a coordinating role while respecting their administrative independence. Despite significant historical challenges including the fall of Byzantium, Ottoman rule, and modern geopolitical pressures, the Ecumenical Patriarchate continues to fulfill its ancient role as "first among equals" in Orthodox Christianity, promoting unity, inter-Orthodox cooperation, and ecumenical dialogue with other Christian denominations.
