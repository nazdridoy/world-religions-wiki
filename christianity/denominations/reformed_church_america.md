# Reformed Church in America

![Reformed Church in America building](reformed_church_america.jpg)

The Reformed Church in America (RCA) is one of the oldest Protestant denominations in the United States, with roots extending back to the Dutch colonial settlement of New Amsterdam (now New York City) in 1628. As the American expression of the Dutch Reformed tradition, the RCA embodies a moderate form of Calvinistic theology, combining Reformed doctrinal commitments with an historically ecumenical spirit. The denomination follows a presbyterian governance structure while maintaining congregational elements, and emphasizes both Word and sacrament in worship. With approximately 196,000 members across 877 congregations primarily concentrated in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, the RCA today faces significant challenges regarding denominational unity while continuing its historical commitments to global mission, church planting, and leadership development.
