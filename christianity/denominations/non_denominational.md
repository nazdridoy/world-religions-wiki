# Non-Denominational Christianity

![Non-Denominational Christianity](non_denominational.jpg)

Non-Denominational Christianity represents a significant and rapidly growing segment of Protestant Christianity characterized by autonomous congregations that intentionally avoid formal affiliation with established denominations. With an estimated 12-15 million adherents in the United States alone across thousands of independent congregations, non-denominational Christianity has become a major religious force, especially since the 1990s. Typically evangelical in theology while rejecting denominational labels, these churches emphasize direct biblical authority, contemporary worship styles, entrepreneurial leadership, and freedom from traditional ecclesiastical structures.

## Overview and Identity

- **Independent Governance**: Autonomous congregations without formal denominational ties
- **Biblical Authority**: Strong emphasis on Scripture as primary authority
- **Evangelical Theology**: Generally conservative Protestant beliefs without denominational distinctives
- **Contemporary Worship**: Modern music and communication styles
- **Entrepreneurial Leadership**: Innovative, often charismatic pastoral leadership
- **Minimalist Ecclesiology**: Simplified church structures and practices
- **Pragmatic Ministry**: Practical approaches focused on growth and relevance
- **Conversion Emphasis**: Focus on personal decision and relationship with Christ
- **Baptistic Practices**: Adult believer's baptism by immersion typically practiced
- **Network Relationships**: Informal connections rather than formal denominational structures
