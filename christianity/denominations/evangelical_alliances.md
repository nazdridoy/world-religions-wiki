Evangelical alliances are networks, associations, and formal organizations that unite evangelical churches, denominations, and institutions across traditional denominational boundaries, promoting cooperative mission, shared theological commitments, and collective influence in society.

## Historical Development

### Origins

The modern evangelical alliance movement emerged in the mid-19th century as a response to several factors:

- Growing secularization and challenges to traditional Christianity
- Desire for cooperation beyond denominational divisions
- Need for united witness in increasingly pluralistic societies
- Recognition of shared evangelical identity despite institutional differences

The World's Evangelical Alliance (now World Evangelical Alliance) was founded in London in 1846 as the first major international evangelical body, bringing together Christians from various Protestant denominations who shared core evangelical commitments.

### Expansion and Growth

- **19th century**: Formation of national evangelical alliances in Britain, United States, and European countries
- **Early 20th century**: Development through missionary conferences and cooperative evangelism
- **Post-WWII era**: Significant growth under the leadership of figures like Billy Graham
- **Late 20th century**: Global expansion, particularly in the Global South
- **21st century**: Emergence of regional alliances and specialized networks

## Theological Foundations

### Evangelical Identity Markers

Evangelical alliances typically unite around core theological commitments:

- **Biblicism**: Strong emphasis on biblical authority and sufficiency
- **Crucicentrism**: Focus on Christ's atoning work on the cross
- **Conversionism**: Necessity of personal conversion and spiritual rebirth
- **Activism**: Commitment to evangelism, mission, and social engagement

### Organizational Statements

Most evangelical alliances articulate their theological positions through:

- Statement of faith defining boundaries of fellowship
- Position papers on contemporary issues
- Consensus documents on contested theological matters
- Affirmations of historic Christian orthodoxy
