# Liberation Theology Movements

![Liberation Theology](liberation_theology.jpg)

Liberation theology represents a diverse family of theological movements that emerged primarily in the Global South during the mid-20th century, emphasizing the Christian gospel as a message of freedom from unjust economic, political, and social conditions. Originating in Latin America in the 1960s and subsequently developing parallel expressions in other contexts, liberation theology interprets Christian faith through the experiences of the poor and oppressed, arguing that God has a "preferential option for the poor" and that the church must actively work toward their liberation from systemic injustice. While controversial and diverse in its expressions, liberation theology has profoundly influenced religious discourse, ecclesial practices, and social movements worldwide.
