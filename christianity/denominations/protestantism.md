Protestantism is one of the three major branches of Christianity, encompassing a diverse array of denominations, theological traditions, and worship styles. Emerging in 16th-century Europe during the Reformation, Protestantism was initially a reform movement challenging certain doctrines, practices, and structures of the Roman Catholic Church. Today, with an estimated 800-900 million adherents worldwide, Protestantism represents a significant and highly diverse Christian tradition characterized by an emphasis on Scripture, justification by faith, the priesthood of all believers, and continual reformation according to biblical principles.
