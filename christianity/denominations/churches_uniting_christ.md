# Churches Uniting in Christ

![Churches Uniting in Christ logo](cuic_logo.jpg)

Churches Uniting in Christ (CUIC) is an ecumenical organization in the United States formed in 2002 as the successor to the Consultation on Church Union (COCU), which operated from 1962 to 2002. It represents one of the most significant formal ecumenical endeavors among American Protestant denominations, bringing together churches from diverse traditions including Methodist, Episcopal, Presbyterian, Reformed, and historically African American denominations. While not a full organic union of its member churches, CUIC focuses on mutual recognition, addressing racial justice, and fostering visible unity in mission and ministry. Despite challenges in implementation, CUIC continues to work toward greater Christian unity while respecting denominational distinctions, embodying both the possibilities and difficulties of ecumenical work in the American religious landscape.
