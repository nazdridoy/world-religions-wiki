# Liberal Catholic Movements

![Liberal Catholic service](liberal_catholic.jpg)

Liberal Catholic movements encompass a diverse spectrum of individuals, organizations, and informal groups within or related to Roman Catholicism that advocate for progressive theological perspectives, inclusive practices, and reforms within Church structure and teaching. While maintaining core Catholic sacramental life and traditions, liberal Catholics generally support greater inclusivity regarding gender roles, sexual ethics, democratic governance, and openness to modern scholarly insights. These movements range from officially recognized reform-minded organizations operating within the Church to independent communities that maintain Catholic liturgical traditions while departing from Vatican authority on certain doctrinal matters.
