American Baptist Churches USA (ABCUSA) is one of the most historically significant Protestant denominations in the United States, with roots tracing back to the earliest Baptist presence in America in the 17th century. As the spiritual heir to the first Baptist church in America founded by Roger Williams in 1638, ABCUSA represents the moderate-to-progressive wing of the Baptist family in the United States. Known for its emphasis on religious liberty, local church autonomy, and social justice advocacy, the denomination maintains a diverse membership of approximately 5,000 congregations and 1.3 million members. ABCUSA embodies a "unity in diversity" approach, allowing for theological breadth while maintaining commitment to core Baptist distinctives and principles.
