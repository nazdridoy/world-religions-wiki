# Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church

![Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church](malankara_orthodox.jpg)

The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, also known as the Indian Orthodox Church, represents one of Christianity's most ancient traditions developed within a distinctly Indian cultural context. Tracing its origins to the evangelistic work of the Apostle Thomas in 52 CE, this autonomous Oriental Orthodox church maintains a unique synthesis of Eastern Syrian liturgical traditions and Indian cultural expressions. With approximately 2.5 million adherents primarily in the Indian state of Kerala, along with growing diaspora communities worldwide, the Malankara Orthodox Church has preserved its apostolic lineage and distinctive identity despite centuries of external pressures from colonial powers and other Christian traditions. Its history of defending indigenous ecclesiastical independence while maintaining communion with the wider Oriental Orthodox family provides a compelling model of contextual Christianity that developed independently of Western missionary influence.
