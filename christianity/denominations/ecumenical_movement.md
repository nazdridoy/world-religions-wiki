# Ecumenical Movement

![World Council of Churches Assembly](ecumenical_assembly.jpg)

The ecumenical movement represents one of Christianity's most significant developments in the modern eraâ€”a global effort to heal divisions among Christian denominations and restore visible unity to the church. Emerging from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this movement seeks to fulfill Jesus's prayer "that they may all be one" (John 17:21) through dialogue, cooperation, and reconciliation across denominational boundaries. While not aiming to create organizational uniformity, the ecumenical movement fosters mutual recognition, shared mission, and theological conversation among diverse Christian traditions. Despite facing challenges from both conservative and progressive directions, the movement has transformed inter-denominational relationships and established enduring structures for Christian unity.
