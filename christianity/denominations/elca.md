# Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA)

![ELCA logo and church](elca_church.jpg)

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States, with approximately 3.3 million baptized members across nearly 9,000 congregations. Formed in 1988 through the merger of three Lutheran bodies, the ELCA represents a progressive expression of American Lutheranism characterized by ecumenical engagement, theological education, social activism, and global mission partnerships. While maintaining its Lutheran theological heritage centered on justification by faith, the ELCA has developed distinctively open positions on biblical interpretation, ministry, sexuality, and interfaith relations that distinguish it from more conservative Lutheran bodies in the American religious landscape.
