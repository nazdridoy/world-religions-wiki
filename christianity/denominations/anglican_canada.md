![Anglican Church of Canada](anglican_canada.jpg)

The Anglican Church of Canada (ACC) is the Canadian expression of Anglicanism, representing the third largest Christian denomination in Canada with approximately 359,000 members in over 1,700 congregations. Founded in 1787 as the "Church of England in the Dominion of Canada," it has evolved into an autonomous province of the worldwide Anglican Communion that reflects Canadian cultural diversity while maintaining historic Anglican traditions. The denomination has been at the forefront of progressive social and theological movements within global Anglicanism, particularly regarding Indigenous reconciliation, inclusive liturgy, and LGBTQ+ affirmation.
