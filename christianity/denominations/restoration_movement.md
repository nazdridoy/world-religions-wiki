The Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Movement or the American Restoration Movement) emerged in the early 19th century as an effort to restore the church to its primitive New Testament pattern, rejecting denominationalism and creeds in favor of biblical authority alone.

## Historical Development

The Restoration Movement began through the parallel efforts of Barton W. Stone in Kentucky and Thomas and Alexander Campbell in Pennsylvania and Virginia. These leaders independently sought to abandon denominational labels and traditions and return to what they considered the essential practices of the first-century church.

### Key Events

- **1801**: Barton W. Stone witnessed the Cane Ridge Revival in Kentucky, which convinced him of the need for Christian unity
- **1807-1809**: Thomas Campbell formed the Christian Association of Washington and wrote the "Declaration and Address," calling for Christian unity
- **1812**: Alexander Campbell (Thomas' son) began advocating for baptism by immersion
- **1832**: The Stone and Campbell movements formally united
- **1906**: The movement officially split into Churches of Christ and Disciples of Christ
- **1920s-1950s**: Further divisions led to the formation of Christian Churches/Churches of Christ (independent)

## Core Beliefs

The Restoration Movement was founded on several key principles:

1. **Biblical Authority**: "Where the Scriptures speak, we speak; where the Scriptures are silent, we are silent"
2. **Christian Unity**: Belief that divisions among Christians should be healed through return to New Testament practices
3. **Congregational Autonomy**: Each congregation is self-governing
4. **Baptism by Immersion**: Baptism of adult believers by full immersion as essential
5. **Weekly Communion**: The Lord's Supper celebrated every Sunday
6. **Rejection of Creeds**: No formal creeds beyond the Bible itself

## Major Branches

Over time, the movement divided into three main branches:

### Churches of Christ

The most conservative branch, emphasizing a cappella (non-instrumental) worship and strict adherence to New Testament patterns. Churches of Christ reject any organization beyond the local congregation and practice autonomy.

### Disciples of Christ (Christian Church)

The most progressive branch, now functioning as a mainstream Protestant denomination with ecumenical involvement. The Disciples maintain congregational governance while participating in wider church structures.

### Christian Churches/Churches of Christ (Independent)

A middle group maintaining Restoration principles while accepting instrumental music. These churches emphasize evangelism, biblical preaching, and maintain a network of Bible colleges and missions organizations while remaining independent.

## Practices

Restoration Movement churches typically practice:

- Weekly communion (Lord's Supper)
- Baptism by immersion for the forgiveness of sins
- Congregational singing (some branches without instruments)
- Autonomous congregational governance
- Bible-centered preaching
- Elder/deacon leadership structure

## Contemporary Influence

Though not among the largest Christian movements, Restoration churches have significantly influenced American religious culture through:

- Emphasis on biblical authority
- Promotion of Christian unity
- Development of influential Bible colleges and universities
- Conservative biblical scholarship
- Simple worship forms
- Congregational church governance

## Geographical Distribution

The movement remains strongest in the United States, particularly in:

- The American Midwest and South
- Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri
- Growing presence in Africa, especially through missions work
- Expanding influence in Asia and Latin America
