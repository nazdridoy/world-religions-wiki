# The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel

![Foursquare Church worship service](foursquare.jpg)

The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, commonly known as the Foursquare Church, is a Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1923 by evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. The name "Foursquare" represents the church's four core beliefs about Jesus Christ: Savior, Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, Healer, and Soon-Coming King. Distinguished by its female founder during an era when women rarely led denominations, Foursquare has grown into a global movement with over 8.8 million members in more than 90,000 churches across 146 countries. The denomination combines Pentecostal expressions with evangelical theology, emphasizing both charismatic gifts and biblical teaching, while maintaining a moderately structured denominational organization that balances local church autonomy with global connectedness.
