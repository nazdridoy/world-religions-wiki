# The Wesleyan Church

![The Wesleyan Church](wesleyan_church.jpg)

The Wesleyan Church is an evangelical, holiness Christian denomination with historical roots in John Wesley's Methodist movement and the 19th-century American holiness revival. With approximately 400,000 members in over 5,000 churches worldwide, the Wesleyan Church emerged from the 1968 merger of the Wesleyan Methodist Church and the Pilgrim Holiness Church. The denomination emphasizes personal conversion, holy living, scriptural authority, and social action, maintaining Wesley's balance of personal and social holiness. While preserving traditional Wesleyan-Arminian theology, the church has adapted to contemporary cultural contexts through modern worship styles, global missions, and educational institutions.
