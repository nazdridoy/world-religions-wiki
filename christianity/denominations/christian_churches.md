# Independent Christian Churches / Churches of Christ

![Christian Churches](../images/christian_churches.jpg)

The Independent Christian Churches, also known as "Christian Churches/Churches of Christ," represent the middle branch of the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement, positioned between the a cappella Churches of Christ and the denominationally-structured Disciples of Christ. Maintaining the Restoration Movement's original vision of Biblical authority and Christian unity while embracing local church autonomy, these congregations are distinguished by accepting instrumental music in worship while rejecting formal denominational structures.

## Historical Development

- **1906**: Initial formal separation when Churches of Christ (a cappella) were listed separately in U.S. Religious Census
- **1920s-1930s**: Growing distinctions from the increasingly liberal Disciples of Christ

### Emergence as a Distinct Movement
