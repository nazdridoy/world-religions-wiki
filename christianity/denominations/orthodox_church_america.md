# Orthodox Church in America

![Orthodox Church in America](orthodox_church_america.jpg)

The Orthodox Church in America (OCA) is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Church with approximately 100,000 adherents across North America. Established through Russian missionary work in Alaska in 1794, it received autocephaly (self-governing status) from the Moscow Patriarchate in 1970, though this status remains contested by some Orthodox jurisdictions. The OCA maintains Eastern Orthodox theology and Byzantine liturgical traditions while expressing these within an American cultural context. Distinguished by its multi-ethnic composition, commitment to English-language worship, and indigenous American leadership, the OCA represents a unique experiment in Orthodox Christianity's adaptation to North American religious landscape while preserving Orthodox theological and liturgical tradition.
