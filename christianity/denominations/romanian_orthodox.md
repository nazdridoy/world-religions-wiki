# Romanian Orthodox Church

![Romanian Orthodox Church](romanian_orthodox.jpg)

The Romanian Orthodox Church (Biserica Ortodoxă Română) is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Church with approximately 16 million adherents, making it the second-largest Orthodox Church after the Russian Orthodox Church. Serving primarily the Romanian people in Romania and Moldova as well as diaspora communities worldwide, it maintains Byzantine liturgical and theological traditions while expressing a distinctly Romanian cultural character. The Church traces its apostolic origins to St. Andrew's missionary work in ancient Scythia Minor (modern Dobrogea), represents one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing Orthodox churches today, and plays a significant role in Romanian national identity, cultural heritage, and contemporary social life.
