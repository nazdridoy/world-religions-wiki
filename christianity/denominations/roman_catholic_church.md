![Roman Catholic Church](st_peters_basilica.jpg)

The Roman Catholic Church is the largest Christian Church in the world with approximately 1.3 billion members, comprising about half of all Christians globally. Led by the Pope, who serves as the Bishop of Rome and successor to Saint Peter, the Church maintains that it is the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church founded by Jesus Christ. With a rich theological tradition spanning two millennia, a complex hierarchical structure, and a global presence across six continents, the Roman Catholic Church represents the largest unified religious institution in the world.

## Overview and Identity

The Roman Catholic Church is distinguished by several key characteristics:

- **Papal Primacy**: Recognition of the Pope as supreme head of the Church and successor to St. Peter
- **Episcopal Structure**: Hierarchical organization with bishops who trace their authority through apostolic succession
- **Seven Sacraments**: Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony
- **Liturgical Tradition**: Centered on the Mass (Eucharistic celebration) as the source and summit of Christian life
- **Magisterium**: Teaching authority vested in the Pope and bishops in communion with him
- **Sacred Tradition**: Alongside Scripture as a source of divine revelation
- **Marian Devotion**: Special veneration of Mary, the Mother of God
- **Universality**: Global presence with both unity in essential doctrine and diversity in cultural expression
- **Religious Orders**: Monastic and apostolic communities dedicated to specific charisms and missions
- **Social Teaching**: Comprehensive body of doctrine addressing human dignity and social justice
