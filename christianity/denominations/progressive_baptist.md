# Progressive National Baptist Convention

![Progressive National Baptist Convention service](progressive_baptist.jpg)

The Progressive National Baptist Convention (PNBC) is a mainline African American Baptist denomination formed in 1961 amidst the Civil Rights Movement. The convention emerged when a group led by Dr. L. Venchael Booth and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. broke away from the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. over issues related to civil rights activism and leadership. PNBC's formation was directly tied to the civil rights struggle, as it provided Dr. King and other activist clergy an organizational base from which to pursue social justice. With approximately 2,000 churches and 1.5 million members, PNBC is distinguished by its progressive approach to Baptist faith that emphasizes social justice, political action, and community transformation alongside spiritual development. The convention maintains its commitment to being the "voice for the voiceless" in contemporary social issues while upholding Baptist principles and African American religious traditions.
