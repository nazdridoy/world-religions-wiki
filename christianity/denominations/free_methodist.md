The Free Methodist Church is an evangelical, holiness denomination founded in 1860 that emerged from American Methodism, emphasizing Wesleyan teachings on sanctification, freedom of the Spirit in worship, free pews for all social classes, freedom from slavery, and freedom of lay involvement in church governance. With approximately 1.2 million members in over 80 countries, the Free Methodist Church maintains a balance of personal piety and social justice, theological orthodoxy and practical ministry, and global engagement with local congregational emphasis.
