![United Methodist Church](united_methodist_church.jpg)

The United Methodist Church (UMC) is a global mainline Protestant denomination with approximately 12 million members worldwide, making it one of the largest Protestant denominations. Founded in 1968 through the union of the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church, the UMC stands in the Wesleyan tradition with its emphasis on both personal holiness and social holiness, balancing evangelical fervor with social action. With a connectional polity, representative governance system, and broadly centrist theological position, the UMC has long been characterized by its commitment to discipleship, education, missions, social justice, and ecumenical cooperation.
