# Armenian Apostolic Church

![Armenian Apostolic Church](armenian_apostolic.jpg)

The Armenian Apostolic Church, officially the Armenian Holy Apostolic Orthodox Church, is one of the world's oldest Christian communities, tracing its foundation to the apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew in the 1st century CE. As the national church of Armenia, it has played a pivotal role in preserving Armenian identity, language, and culture throughout centuries of foreign domination, persecution, and diaspora. A member of the Oriental Orthodox communion, the Armenian Church is distinguished by its unique liturgical traditions, art, architecture, and theological perspectives. With approximately 9 million adherents worldwide, the church maintains two catholicosates—Etchmiadzin and Cilicia—along with two patriarchates in Jerusalem and Constantinople, serving Armenian communities across the globe while bearing witness to an unbroken Christian tradition that predates the establishment of many major Christian denominations.
