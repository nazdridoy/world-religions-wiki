# Christian Churches Together

![Christian Churches Together logo](../images/cct_logo.jpg)

Christian Churches Together (CCT) is a unique ecumenical forum in the United States that brings together evangelical, historic Protestant, Orthodox, Catholic, and Pentecostal/Charismatic traditions in an unprecedented level of inclusive dialogue and cooperation.

## Historical Development

### Formation and Vision

Christian Churches Together was officially launched in 2006 after several years of planning and consultation. Its development was motivated by:

- Recognition of the fragmented nature of American Christianity
- Desire for a more inclusive ecumenical body than existing organizations
- Need for a space where diverse Christian traditions could engage in relationship-building
- Commitment to respectful dialogue across significant theological differences

The founding vision emphasized creating a new kind of ecumenical space rather than replacing existing ecumenical organizations like the National Council of Churches.

### Organizational Structure

CCT developed a distinctive structure designed to ensure balanced representation:

- **Five Family Structure**: Participating churches organized into five "families" (Evangelical/Pentecostal, Historic Protestant, Historic Black, Orthodox, and Catholic)
- **Consensus Decision-Making**: Requiring agreement across all five families
- **Equal Voice Model**: Ensuring smaller traditions have meaningful representation
- **Relationship-Centered Approach**: Prioritizing relationship building over institutional structure

## Theological Framework

### Unity in Diversity

CCT is built on several key theological principles:

- Affirmation of the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds as expressions of common faith
- Recognition of baptism as the foundation of Christian unity
- Acknowledgment of significant theological differences while seeking common ground
- Commitment to Jesus' prayer "that they may all be one" (John 17:21)

### Mission Statement

The organization articulates its purpose through a four-fold commitment:

1. **Celebrating** a common confession of faith in the Triune God
2. **Discerning** the guidance of the Holy Spirit through prayer and theological dialogue
3. **Witnessing** together to the good news of salvation in Christ
4. **Serving** the common good through advocacy for justice and peace

## Major Activities and Initiatives

- Equal voice for historically marginalized communities
- Focus on relationship over institutional structure
- Commitment to hearing all theological perspectives

### Complementary Ecumenism

CCT positions itself as complementary to other ecumenical organizations:

- Fills gaps left by more narrowly defined ecumenical bodies
- Creates space for traditions not comfortable in other ecumenical forums
- Focuses on relationship-building rather than formal agreements
- Emphasizes lived experience alongside theological formulations

## Challenges and Limitations

- Securing stable funding across diverse constituencies
- Maintaining momentum between annual gatherings

### Theological Tensions

- Addressing historical wounds and mutual suspicion
- Reconciling different understandings of church authority

### Participation Gaps

- Limited engagement from some evangelical and Pentecostal bodies
- Challenges in securing consistent denominational commitment
- Navigating representation of non-denominational Christianity
- Engaging younger generations in ecumenical dialogue

## Impact and Significance

### Mutual Recognition
