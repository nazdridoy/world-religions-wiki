# Bulgarian Orthodox Church

![Bulgarian Orthodox Church](bulgarian_orthodox.jpg)

The Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Българска православна църква, Balgarska pravoslavna tsarkva), officially the Bulgarian Orthodox Church – Bulgarian Patriarchate, is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Church with approximately 6-8 million adherents primarily in Bulgaria and Bulgarian diaspora communities. With roots dating back to the 9th century Christianization of Bulgaria, it played a crucial role in forming Bulgarian national identity, developing Slavic literacy, and preserving Bulgarian culture during five centuries of Ottoman rule. The Church follows Eastern Orthodox theology and liturgical practices while maintaining distinctive Bulgarian traditions, architecture, and music. As the traditional religious institution of Bulgaria, it continues to navigate its role in post-Communist society while addressing challenges of secularization, demographic decline, and modernization.
