# Russian Orthodox Church

![Russian Orthodox Church](russian_orthodox.jpg)

The Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), officially the Moscow Patriarchate, is the largest autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Christian church. With over 100 million faithful worldwide, it exerts significant religious, cultural, and sometimes political influence across Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and other countries with historical Russian presence. Emerging as a metropolia of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in the 10th century, it gained autocephalous status in 1448 and was elevated to a patriarchate in 1589. The church endured complex relations with the state throughout imperial Russia, survived Soviet persecution, and experienced a remarkable revival after 1991. Today, it remains a central institution in Russian national identity while navigating the challenges of modernity and geopolitical tensions.
