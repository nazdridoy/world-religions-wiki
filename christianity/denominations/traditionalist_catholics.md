# Traditionalist Catholic Groups

![Traditionalist Catholics at Latin Mass](traditionalist_catholics.jpg)

Traditionalist Catholicism comprises various groups, movements, and individuals within or adjacent to the Roman Catholic Church who adhere to traditional Catholic beliefs, liturgy, and practices, particularly those prevalent before the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). These groups range from those in full communion with Rome to schismatic organizations that reject the legitimacy of recent popes. What unites them is their commitment to preserving traditional Catholic liturgy, particularly the Tridentine Mass (Latin Mass), and their skepticism or outright rejection of many post-Vatican II reforms, which they view as compromising authentic Catholic teachings and traditions.
