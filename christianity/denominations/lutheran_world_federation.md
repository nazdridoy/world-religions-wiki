The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) is a global communion of Lutheran churches founded in 1947. Representing over 77 million Christians in 148 member churches across 99 countries, the LWF serves as the primary international organization connecting Lutheran denominations worldwide. While respecting the autonomy of individual member churches, the LWF facilitates cooperation in theological dialogue, humanitarian response, ecumenical engagement, and shared witness to the gospel of Jesus Christ. As a communion grounded in the Reformation principles of justification by faith alone, the LWF balances theological heritage with contemporary social engagement.
