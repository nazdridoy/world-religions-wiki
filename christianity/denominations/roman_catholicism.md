Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination with approximately 1.3 billion members worldwide. As the oldest continuously functioning international institution in the world, the Roman Catholic Church traces its origins directly to Jesus Christ and the apostles, particularly St. Peter, whom Catholics consider the first Pope. Characterized by its hierarchical structure centered on the papacy, rich sacramental and liturgical tradition, and extensive theological development, Roman Catholicism represents one of the three major branches of Christianity alongside Eastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism.
