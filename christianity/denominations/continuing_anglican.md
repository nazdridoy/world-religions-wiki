# Continuing Anglican Movement

![Continuing Anglican Church](continuing_anglican.jpg)

The Continuing Anglican Movement refers to a group of churches that separated from the Anglican Communion in the 1970s and 1980s in response to theological liberalization and liturgical changes in mainstream Anglicanism, particularly in the Episcopal Church in the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada. These traditionalist Anglican bodies maintain pre-1970s Anglican theology, practices, and liturgies, rejecting women's ordination, same-sex relationships, and modernist theological trends. While small in size compared to mainstream Anglican churches, continuing Anglican jurisdictions have maintained a significant presence in North America and increasingly worldwide.

## Historical Development

### St. Louis Congress and Formation (1977-1980)

- Response to the Episcopal Church's 1976 General Convention approving women's ordination
- St. Louis Congress meeting in September 1977 with approximately 2,000 traditionalists
- Adoption of the "Affirmation of St. Louis" as founding document
- Commitment to traditional Anglican theology, liturgy, and moral teaching
- Formation of the Anglican Church of North America (not the current ACNA)
- Consecration of four bishops in Denver in January 1978
- Early divisions between newly formed continuing jurisdictions
- Establishment of parishes across the United States and Canada

### Proliferation and Division (1980-2007)

- Formation of multiple continuing Anglican jurisdictions
- Establishment of Anglican Catholic Church, Anglican Province of Christ the King, United Episcopal Church
- Further splits over personalities, churchmanship, and canonical issues
- Development of distinctive identities within the movement
- Growth of international mission work and overseas dioceses
- Development of theological education institutions
- Publication of traditional prayer books and liturgical resources
- Limited cooperation between various jurisdictions

### Convergence and Realignment (2007-present)

- Increasing efforts toward reunification and intercommunion
- Formation of the Traditional Anglican Communion as global federation
- Unsuccessful attempt by some groups to enter Roman Catholic communion through Anglican Ordinariate
- Significant intercommunion agreements in 2017 (G-4 Concordat) between major continuing bodies
- Growing distinction from later conservative Anglican movements (like ACNA)
- Development of international presence beyond North America
- Stabilization of institutional structures and succession
- Rapprochement with some continuing churches and Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions

## Key Theological Distinctives

### Theological Conservatism

- Adherence to the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral
- Seven ecumenical councils as doctrinal authorities
- Affirmation of the Thirty-Nine Articles (with varying emphases)
- High view of Scripture as divinely inspired and authoritative
- Rejection of theological liberalism and modernism
- Traditional moral theology on marriage, sexuality, and sanctity of life
- Classical Christology and Trinitarian theology
- Traditional sacramental theology

### Liturgical Traditionalism

- Use of traditional prayer books (1928 BCP in America, 1962 BCP in Canada)
- Rejection of modernized liturgical reforms
- Strong emphasis on liturgical precision and rubrical adherence
- Preservation of Cranmerian language and Coverdale Psalter
- High churchmanship in most continuing jurisdictions
- Traditional church music and hymnody
- Maintenance of liturgical seasons and calendar
- Emphasis on ceremonial integrity

### Ecclesiastical Polity

- Traditional episcopal governance
- Male-only ordained ministry
- Three-fold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons
- Claim to valid apostolic succession
- Synodical governance with clerical and lay participation
- Independence from Canterbury and secular Anglican structures
- Traditional parish organization and governance
- Diocesan and provincial structures often crossing national boundaries

## Major Continuing Anglican Bodies

### The G-4 Concordat Churches

- **Anglican Catholic Church (ACC)**: One of the original continuing Anglican churches founded after the St. Louis Congress, with traditional Anglo-Catholic worship and global presence
- **Anglican Church in America (ACA)**: North American province of the Traditional Anglican Communion, balancing evangelical and catholic elements
- **Anglican Province of America (APA)**: Founded in 1995 by bishops from the ACA, emphasizing traditional Anglican worship with moderate ceremonial
- **Diocese of the Holy Cross (DHC)**: Anglo-Catholic body in communion with the ACC, emphasizing traditional liturgical and theological positions

### Other Significant Bodies

- **Anglican Province of Christ the King (APCK)**: Traditional high church jurisdiction based primarily in western United States
- **United Episcopal Church of North America (UECNA)**: More central churchmanship with emphasis on 1928 BCP
- **Orthodox Anglican Church (OAC)**: More evangelical expression of continuing Anglicanism
- **Traditional Anglican Communion (TAC)**: International federation of continuing churches (now diminished after many joined Roman Catholic ordinariates)

## Contemporary Issues and Challenges

### Institutional Challenges

- **Small Size**: Most jurisdictions have limited membership and resources
- **Aging Congregations**: Demographic challenges with older membership
- **Property Issues**: Many congregations lack permanent church buildings
- **Geographic Distribution**: Widely scattered parishes making episcopal oversight difficult
- **Limited Visibility**: Low public profile compared to mainstream Anglican churches
- **Financial Constraints**: Limited funding for clergy support and institutional development
- **Succession Planning**: Ensuring continuity of episcopal leadership and clergy
- **Seminary Education**: Developing and maintaining theological formation programs

### Ecumenical Relationships

- Continuing Anglican churches maintain various external relationships:
- **Eastern Orthodoxy**: Dialogue with various Orthodox jurisdictions, particularly non-Chalcedonian churches
- **Roman Catholicism**: Complex relationship following creation of Anglican Ordinariates
- **ACNA and Global South Anglicans**: Limited cooperation despite theological similarities
- **Traditional Western Rite**: Preservation of Anglican patrimony in broader Catholic tradition
- **Old Catholic Churches**: Intercommunion with some independent Old Catholic bodies
- **Polish National Catholic Church**: Dialogue and limited intercommunion
- **Non-Canterbury Anglicans**: Relationships with other traditional Anglican groups worldwide
