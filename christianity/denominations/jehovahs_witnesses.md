Jehovah's Witnesses are a distinctive restorationist Christian denomination founded in the late 19th century. Known for their door-to-door evangelism, publishing activities, and particular theological positions, they have grown from a small Bible study group into a global organization with approximately 8.7 million active members (called "publishers") across 240 countries and territories.

## Origins and Development

The movement began as a small Bible study group in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now part of Pittsburgh) in the 1870s, led by Charles Taze Russell. Key developments include:

- Formation of Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1884 (later Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society)
- Russell's leadership focused on Bible chronology and prophetic interpretation
- Joseph Franklin Rutherford's presidency (1917-1942) brought major organizational changes
- Adoption of the name "Jehovah's Witnesses" in 1931, based on Isaiah 43:10-12
- Nathan Knorr's leadership (1942-1977) expanded global missionary work and publishing
- Development of the Governing Body structure in the 1970s
- Significant doctrinal refinements throughout their history
- Expansion from a primarily American movement to a global organization

## Core Beliefs

Jehovah's Witnesses hold several distinctive theological positions:

- **Monotheism**: Strict belief in Jehovah (God) as the only true God
- **Non-Trinitarian**: View Jesus as God's first creation, a created being rather than God incarnate
- **Biblical Authority**: Emphasis on the Bible as God's Word, using their New World Translation
- **God's Kingdom**: Belief that God's Kingdom is a literal government that will rule earth
- **1914 Chronology**: Teaching that Christ's invisible presence began in 1914
- **Limited Salvation**: Belief that only 144,000 "anointed" ones go to heaven, while faithful others will live forever on a paradise earth
- **Non-participation**: Abstention from politics, military service, and many holidays
- **Blood Doctrine**: Refusal of blood transfusions based on biblical commands to "abstain from blood"
- **Imminent End**: Expectation of the imminent destruction of the present world system at Armageddon

## Structure and Governance

The organization operates under a hierarchical structure:

- **Governing Body**: A small group of senior men (currently eight) who provide spiritual direction
- **World Headquarters**: Based in Warwick, New York, coordinates global activities
- **Branch Committees**: Regional oversight bodies
- **Circuit Overseers**: Travel to congregations providing oversight and encouragement
- **Congregations**: Local bodies led by bodies of elders (all male)
- **Publishers**: Active members who engage in evangelizing work

All leadership positions are filled by men, reflecting their interpretation of biblical gender roles. The organization is highly centralized, with uniform literature, meeting formats, and teachings worldwide.

## Global Presence

From their American origins, Jehovah's Witnesses have expanded to become a truly global religion:

- Strong presence in North and South America, particularly in the United States and Brazil
- Significant growth in Africa, Mexico, and parts of Asia
- Notable resilience and growth despite persecution in some regions
- Extensive translation work (publishing in over 1,000 languages)
- Major construction projects for Kingdom Halls (meeting places) and branch offices
- International conventions regularly held across multiple countries
- Legal challenges in various nations regarding blood transfusions, military service, and religious recognition

## Contemporary Issues

As the organization navigates the 21st century, it faces several challenges:

- Addressing child protection policies and historical cases of abuse
- Navigating medical ethics particularly regarding blood transfusions
- Balancing technological adaptation with traditional methods of ministry
- Maintaining doctrinal unity in an increasingly information-rich environment
- Addressing former member activism and criticism
- Responding to declining growth rates in developed nations
- Continuing persecution in some regions, including Russia
