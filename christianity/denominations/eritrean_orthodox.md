# Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church

![Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church](eritrean_orthodox.jpg)

The Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church is an Oriental Orthodox church with approximately 2.5 million adherents, primarily in Eritrea and in diaspora communities worldwide. Having obtained autocephalous (self-governing) status in 1993 following Eritrea's independence from Ethiopia, the church maintains the same theological positions, liturgical practices, and cultural expressions as its parent Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, from which it separated primarily for geo-political rather than theological reasons. The word "Tewahedo" means "unified" or "made one," referring to the church's non-Chalcedonian Christology that emphasizes the complete union of Christ's divine and human natures. Despite its relatively recent independent status, the Eritrean Orthodox Church preserves ancient Christian traditions that trace back to the 4th century evangelization of the Aksumite Empire, making it one of the world's oldest continuous Christian traditions.
