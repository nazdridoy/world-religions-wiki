# Coptic Orthodox Church

![Coptic Orthodox Church](coptic_orthodox.jpg)

The Coptic Orthodox Church, also known as the Church of Alexandria, is one of the oldest Christian bodies in the world, tracing its origins directly to the apostle Mark who brought Christianity to Egypt in the 1st century CE. As part of the Oriental Orthodox communion, it separated from the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches following the Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE over Christological differences. Despite centuries of persecution under various regimes, the Coptic Church has preserved ancient Christian traditions, liturgy, art, and monasticism. Today, with approximately 10-15 million adherents globally, the church represents Egypt's largest Christian community and maintains a growing international presence.
