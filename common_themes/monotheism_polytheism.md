# Monotheism vs Polytheism

This page explores how different religions approach the concept of divine beings, from strict monotheism to complex polytheistic systems.

## Spectrum of Belief

Rather than a simple binary, religious beliefs about divine beings often fall on a spectrum:

1. **Strict Monotheism**: One God only; no other divine beings exist
2. **Henotheism**: Focus on one God while acknowledging others exist
3. **Monolatry**: Worship of one God while accepting the existence of others
4. **Polytheism**: Multiple gods with distinct identities and roles
5. **Pantheism**: Divine is identical with the universe
6. **Panentheism**: Divine pervades the universe but extends beyond it
7. **Animism**: Natural objects, phenomena, and the universe itself possess souls
