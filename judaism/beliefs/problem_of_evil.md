![Rabbi comforting mourners](problem_of_evil.jpg)

The problem of evil—how to reconcile the existence of evil and suffering with belief in an all-powerful, all-knowing, and benevolent God—represents one of the most profound theological challenges within Judaism. Throughout its long history, Jewish thought has developed multiple approaches to theodicy (justifying God's ways in the face of evil) that reflect the tradition's emphasis on both intellectual inquiry and lived religious experience. From biblical wrestling with divine justice to post-Holocaust theology, Judaism offers diverse and nuanced responses to the question of why a good God permits evil in the world.
