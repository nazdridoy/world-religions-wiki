The concept of the "End of Days" (Acharit HaYamim) in Judaism refers to a future transformative era that will mark the culmination of human history as we know it. Unlike apocalyptic visions in some other religious traditions that emphasize destruction, Judaism's End of Days is primarily characterized by profound positive transformation: universal peace, justice, divine knowledge, and the perfection of the world. While interpretations vary across different Jewish movements and historical periods, this concept has remained a source of hope and inspiration throughout Jewish history.
