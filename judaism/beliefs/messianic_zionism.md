Messianic Zionism represents a distinctive theological and political movement within Judaism that interprets modern Zionism—particularly the establishment of the State of Israel and subsequent territorial expansions—as part of an unfolding divine process leading toward ultimate redemption. This perspective fuses traditional Jewish messianic expectations with contemporary nationalist politics, creating a powerful religious-political synthesis with significant implications for Israeli society and Middle Eastern geopolitics.

## Historical Development

### Theological Foundations

The movement builds upon traditional concepts:

- **Traditional Messianism**: Historic Jewish belief in eventual redemption and ingathering of exiles
- **Three-Stage Redemption**: Classical rabbinical framework of exile, return, and messianic fulfillment

- **Kabbalistic Concepts**: Mystical ideas about cosmic repair (tikkun) through settlement
- **Biblical Promise**: Divine covenant guaranteeing the Land to Abraham's descendants
