The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and its subsequent development have generated diverse, complex, and often passionate religious responses within Judaism. The modern state has forced Jewish religious thinkers to confront fundamental theological questions about divine providence, messianism, Jewish peoplehood, and the relationship between religious tradition and secular political sovereignty in unprecedented ways.

## Orthodox Perspectives

### Religious Zionist Views

Religious Zionism embraces the state as religiously significant:

- **Beginning of Redemption**: State formation as "first flowering" (atchalta d'geulah) of messianic process
- **Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1865-1935)**: Foundational thinker seeing divine purpose in secular Zionism
- **Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook (1891-1982)**: Interpreted territorial expansion after 1967 as messianic advancement
- **Special Divine Providence**: Viewing Israel's military victories as miraculous
- **Religious Significance Despite Secularism**: Finding hidden holiness within secular state institutions

### Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) Responses

Multiple positions exist within Haredi Judaism:

- **Principled Anti-Zionism**: Satmar and allied groups rejecting state as religiously illegitimate
- **Pragmatic Non-Zionism**: Agudath Israel accepting state's reality while rejecting Zionist ideology
- **Three Oaths Interpretation**: Invoking talmudic passage against "forcing the end" (Ketubot 111a)
- **Practical Accommodation**: Participating in political system while maintaining ideological distance
- **Demographic Growth**: Increasing Haredi presence and political influence within state
