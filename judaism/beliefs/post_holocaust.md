![Holocaust memorial and Torah](post_holocaust.jpg)

Post-Holocaust theology (also known as Holocaust theology or post-Shoah theology) represents the profound religious and philosophical responses that emerged within Judaism following the systematic murder of six million Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during World War II. The unprecedented scale and nature of this catastrophe challenged fundamental Jewish theological assumptions and prompted a radical rethinking of traditional beliefs about God, covenant, suffering, and redemption. The theological responses to the Holocaust continue to shape contemporary Jewish thought and remain a central concern in religious discourse.

## Historical Context

### The Catastrophe

The historical background of theological responses:

- **Scholarly Impact**: Death of rabbis, teachers, and religious leadership
- **Systematic Nature**: Industrial, state-sponsored genocide targeting Jews for complete annihilation

### Immediate Religious Responses
