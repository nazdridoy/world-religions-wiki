# Environmental Ethics - Jewish Perspectives on Creation Care

![Nature and Jewish teachings](environmental_ethics.jpg)

Jewish environmental ethics draws upon centuries of textual tradition, theological concepts, and legal frameworks to address humanity's relationship with the natural world. While the term "environmental ethics" is modern, Judaism has long maintained principles governing human interaction with creation, offering a distinctive perspective that balances human needs with responsibilities toward nature, animals, and future generations.

## Biblical Foundations

### Creation Narratives

Genesis provides foundational concepts:

- Creation as fundamentally good (ki tov) and divinely valued
- Humans formed from earth (adamah), indicating kinship with the natural world
- Humans given dual mandate to "work/till" (l'ovdah) and "protect/guard" (l'shomrah) the garden (Genesis 2:15)
- Dominion (radah) over creation interpreted as responsible stewardship rather than exploitation
- All creatures blessed by God and declared "very good"

### Agricultural Laws

The Torah establishes principles of environmental sustainability:

- **Shabbat**: Weekly rest extending to land, animals, and all creation
- **Shmita/Sabbatical Year**: Land's seventh-year rest preventing soil depletion
- **Yovel/Jubilee**: Fiftieth-year restoration of land ownership
- **Pe'ah**: Leaving corners of fields unharvested for wildlife and the poor
- **Bal Tashchit**: Prohibition against needless destruction, first applied to fruit trees (Deuteronomy 20:19-20)

### Animal Welfare

Biblical concern for animals appears throughout:

- Animals included in Sabbath rest requirement
- Prohibition against muzzling an ox while it treads grain
- Requirement to help an enemy's overburdened animal
- Command to send away a mother bird before taking eggs (shiluach haken)
- Prohibition against yoking different species together (kilayim)

## Rabbinic Development

### Bal Tashchit Expansion

The rabbis extended the fruit tree prohibition into a broader principle:

- Talmudic discussions applying principle to various resources
- Prohibition against wasting oil, clothing, buildings, water, and food
- Exemptions for genuine human need while maintaining core principle
- Proportionality emphasized in evaluating legitimate use versus waste
- Application to indirect and passive destruction

### Urban Environmental Regulations

The Mishnah and Talmud developed detailed environmental zoning laws:

- Requirements for distance between potentially polluting activities and dwellings
- Regulations governing waste disposal
- Protection of shared water resources
- Noise pollution controls
- Community responsibilities for infrastructure maintenance

### Tzaar Baalei Chayyim

The rabbinic principle of preventing animal suffering:

- Prohibition against causing unnecessary pain to animals
- Requirement to feed animals before oneself
- Regulations on humane treatment in agricultural settings
- Discussion of animal consciousness and sensitivity
- Balance between human needs and animal welfare

## Medieval Philosophical Perspectives

### Maimonides' Approach

Moses Maimonides (1138-1204) developed several relevant perspectives:

- Environmental destruction seen as failure of intellectual and moral virtue
- Nature's perfect order and design as evidence of divine wisdom
- Human health connected to environmental conditions
- Moderation in resource use as religious virtue
- Compassion toward animals as spiritual discipline preventing cruelty toward humans

### Kabbalistic Views

Mystical tradition added cosmic dimensions:

- Creation as divine self-limitation (tzimtzum) creating space for environment
- Natural world containing divine sparks awaiting elevation
- Human actions affecting cosmic harmony through complex systems
- Trees and plants as channels for divine energy
- Physical creation as external manifestation of spiritual reality

### Practical Guidance

Medieval codes addressed everyday environmental concerns:

- Regulations on water usage and rights
- Community responsibility for clean public spaces
- Smoke and pollution abatement requirements
- Guidelines for sustainable land use
- Balance between development and conservation

## Modern Jewish Environmental Thought

### Early Modern Voices

As environmental awareness grew, Jewish thinkers responded:

- Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook's vision of harmony between humanity and nature
- Martin Buber's extension of I-Thou relationship to natural world
- Samson Raphael Hirsch's interpretation of bal tashchit as respect for creation's purpose
- Sabbath as ongoing environmental testimony against exploitation

### Contemporary Theological Approaches

Modern Jewish environmentalism offers varied theological foundations:

- **Covenant**: Expanded to include responsibility for earth
- **Partnership**: Humans as God's partners in ongoing creation
- **Stewardship**: Resource management on behalf of divine owner
- **Justice**: Environmental issues as matters of social ethics
- **Holiness**: Creation as revelation of divine presence

### Eco-Kosher Movement

Integration of environmental concerns with traditional practice:
