# Creator and Sustainer: God's Relationship to Existence

![Creation scene from Hebrew manuscript](creation_manuscript.jpg)

In Jewish theology, God is understood not only as the Creator who brought the universe into being, but also as the continuous Sustainer who maintains existence at every moment. This dual concept—God as both the original source of all being and the ongoing power that sustains reality—forms a fundamental aspect of Jewish religious thought.

## Creation: The Divine Origin of Existence

### Biblical Foundation

The Hebrew Bible begins with the powerful declaration of God's creative activity:

> "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1)

The creation narratives in Genesis establish several key theological principles:
- Creation ex nihilo (from nothing) rather than from pre-existing matter
- Divine intentionality and purpose behind the universe
- The goodness of the created world ("God saw that it was good")
- Humans created in the divine image as the pinnacle of creation
- The establishment of order (seder) from chaos (tohu va-vohu)

### Theological Significance

God as Creator has profound implications in Jewish thought:
- The universe is contingent, not self-sufficient or eternal
- God transcends nature as its source rather than being part of it
- All existence ultimately depends on divine will
- Creation establishes God's sovereignty over all that exists
- The fact of creation grounds the concept of covenant

### Creation and Time

Jewish tradition understands creation as marking the beginning of time itself:
- God exists beyond time while creating temporal reality
- The traditional Jewish calendar counts years "from the creation of the world"
- The Sabbath commemorates both creation and divine rest
- Creation is not merely a past event but an ongoing relationship

## Sustaining the World: Continuous Creation

### Divine Providence

Jewish thought emphasizes that God's creative work is ongoing:
- "He who daily renews the work of creation" (from morning prayers)
- The concept of hashgachah (divine providence) overseeing the world
- The universe requires continuous divine sustenance to exist
- Without ongoing divine will, existence would revert to nothingness

### Gradations of Providence

Different Jewish thinkers have proposed various understandings of how God sustains the world:
- **General providence**: God maintains natural laws and systems
- **Particular providence**: God's special attention to individuals or the Jewish people
- **Hashgachah pratit**: Individualized divine supervision of people's lives
- **Natural causation**: God working through natural processes rather than miracles

## Philosophical Developments

Jewish philosophers have refined these concepts through the ages:

### Maimonides' Approach

Moses Maimonides (1138-1204) articulated:
- God as the "Prime Mover" and "Necessary Existent"
- Creation as an act of divine will rather than necessity
- Natural processes as the normal mode of divine governance
- Rejection of any notion of physical labor or effort in God's creative act
- Interpretation of anthropomorphic biblical descriptions as metaphors

### Crescas' Critique

Hasdai Crescas (c.1340-1410/11) offered an alternative view:
- Creation motivated by divine love and goodness
- God's direct involvement in particulars
- Critique of purely naturalistic or rational approaches
- Divine will and knowledge extending to individual events

### Kabbalah and Creation

Jewish mystical tradition developed elaborate creation theories:
- **Tzimtzum**: God's self-contraction to make space for creation
- **Sefirot**: Divine emanations through which creation occurs
- **Continuous divine flow**: Creation as constant divine streaming into reality
- **Divine sparks**: Elements of divine light embedded in all creation

## Biblical and Rabbinic Imagery

Jewish tradition employs various images for the creator-sustainer:

### Creator as Craftsman

Biblical texts sometimes portray God as a skilled artisan:
- Potter forming humans from clay (Genesis 2:7)
- Architect measuring and designing the universe (Proverbs 8:27-29)
- Artist painting the heavens (Job 26:7-14)
- Builder constructing with wisdom (Proverbs 3:19)

### Sustainer as Parent

God's sustaining role often appears in parental imagery:
- Nurturing provider of food and necessities (Psalm 104:27-28)
- Compassionate caregiver (Psalm 145:15-16)
- Mother who does not forget her children (Isaiah 49:15)
- Father who carries the people (Deuteronomy 1:31)

### King and Ruler

Royal metaphors emphasize divine sovereignty:
- Ruler establishing laws of nature (Jeremiah 33:25-26)
- King commanding the elements (Psalm 148:5-6)
- Governor appointing times and seasons (Genesis 8:22)
- Sovereign over all creation (Psalm 24:1-2)

## Creation in Jewish Liturgy

Jewish prayer continually acknowledges God's creative and sustaining roles:

### Daily Prayers

- Morning blessings thank God "who spoke and the world came into being"
- The first blessing before the Shema praises God "who forms light and creates darkness"
- The Amidah refers to God who "sustains the living with kindness"
- Prayers recognize God "who renews each day the work of creation"

### Sabbath Significance

The Sabbath specifically commemorates creation:
- Kiddush (sanctification) recalls God as Creator
- The day itself instituted as a memorial to creation (Exodus 20:11)
- Sabbath rest mirrors divine rest after creation
- The Havdalah ceremony distinguishes between sacred and ordinary, reflecting divine ordering of creation

## Practical Implications

The concept of God as Creator-Sustainer has several practical dimensions:

### Environmental Ethics

Jewish environmentalism draws on creation theology:
- Humans as stewards not absolute owners (bal tashchit - prohibition against needless destruction)
- Responsibility to preserve God's creation
- Recognition of the intrinsic value of all created beings
- Sabbatical and Jubilee years as allowing the land to rest

### Social Ethics

Divine creation grounds Jewish social ethics:
- Human dignity based on creation in God's image
- Fundamental equality of all humans as divine creations
- Care for the vulnerable as imitating God's sustaining care
- Just treatment of others as recognizing their divine origin

### Personal Religious Life

These concepts shape individual religious experience:
- Gratitude to God as the source of existence
- Trust in divine providence
- Awareness of dependence on divine sustenance
- Recognition of purpose in a divinely designed universe

## Modern Jewish Approaches

Contemporary Jewish thought has reinterpreted these traditional concepts:

### Dialogue with Science

Modern Jewish thinkers have addressed the relationship between creation theology and science:
- Non-literal readings of Genesis creation accounts
- Understanding days of creation as epochs or phases
- Seeing evolution as God's method of creating diversity
- Natural laws as the consistent expression of divine will

### Process Theology

Some modern Jewish thinkers have adopted elements of process thought:
- God as involved in the ongoing creative process
- Divine persuasion rather than coercion
- Creation as collaborative rather than unilateral
- God affected by and responding to the created world

### Post-Holocaust Theology

After the Holocaust, some Jewish thinkers reconsidered divine providence:
- Questions about God's sustaining presence in times of catastrophe
- Theories of divine self-limitation
- Emphasis on human responsibility for mending the world
- Interpretations focusing on covenant partnership rather than divine control

## Denominational Perspectives

Different Jewish movements approach these concepts distinctively:

### Orthodox Judaism

- Generally maintains traditional understanding of literal divine creation
- Emphasizes ongoing divine providence
- Various approaches to harmonizing tradition with modern science
- Strong emphasis on God's continuous oversight of the world

### Conservative Judaism

- Often accepts evolutionary science while maintaining divine role in creation
- Views biblical accounts as sacred myth conveying theological truth
- Emphasizes God working through natural processes
- Balanced approach to providence and human autonomy

### Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism

- Often interpret creation accounts metaphorically
- May understand God's creative role in naturalistic terms
- Focus on human partnership in ongoing creation
- Emphasis on ethical implications rather than metaphysical claims
