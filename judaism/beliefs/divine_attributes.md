# Divine Attributes in Judaism

![Ancient Hebrew text describing God](divine_attributes_text.jpg)

Judaism has developed a rich theological tradition articulating the attributes or characteristics of God. While maintaining that God ultimately transcends human comprehension, Jewish sources have described divine qualities to help human understanding and guide religious practice.

## Foundational Concepts

### Balancing Knowledge and Mystery

Judaism approaches divine attributes with a paradoxical stance:
- God is ultimately unknowable in essence
- Yet God can be known through attributes and actions
- Human language is necessarily limited in describing God
- Negative theology (describing what God is not) is often employed

### Sources of Divine Attributes

Jewish conceptions of divine attributes derive from multiple sources:
- **Biblical descriptions**: Names and actions of God in Tanakh
- **Rabbinic elaborations**: Talmudic and midrashic discussions
- **Liturgical formulations**: Descriptions in prayer texts
- **Philosophical explorations**: Medieval rationalist approaches
- **Mystical traditions**: Kabbalistic understandings

## Biblical Divine Attributes

The Hebrew Bible presents several key attributes of God:

### Thirteen Attributes of Mercy

Exodus 34:6-7 provides a pivotal description of God's attributes of mercy (middot harachamim):

> "The LORD, the LORD, a God compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in kindness and faithfulness, extending kindness to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin..."

These attributes, recited on holy days and times of repentance, emphasize God's compassion, patience, and forgiveness.

### Other Biblical Attributes

Additional divine qualities found in biblical texts include:
- **Justice** (tzedek) - "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?" (Genesis 18:25)
- **Holiness** (kadosh) - "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts" (Isaiah 6:3)
- **Eternity** - "God is the eternal King" (Jeremiah 10:10)
- **Omnipresence** - "Where can I go from Your spirit?" (Psalm 139:7)
- **Omnipotence** - "Is anything too wondrous for the LORD?" (Genesis 18:14)
- **Jealousy** - "For the LORD your God is a jealous God" (Deuteronomy 5:9)

## Philosophical Approaches

Medieval Jewish philosophers systematized and reinterpreted divine attributes:

### Maimonides' Negative Attributes

Moses Maimonides (Rambam, 1138-1204) argued in his "Guide for the Perplexed" that positive attributes cannot truly apply to God:
- Positive descriptions inevitably limit God's perfection
- Attributes should be understood as what God is not (e.g., God is "wise" means God lacks no wisdom)
- Only negative attributes and descriptions of actions are permissible
- God's essence is absolutely simple and indivisible

### Saadia Gaon's Essential Attributes

Saadia Gaon (882-942) identified three essential divine attributes:
- **Life** (chayim)
- **Power** (koach)
- **Knowledge** (da'at)

He taught these are not additions to God's essence but different ways of expressing the unity of divine being.

### Judah Halevi's Approach

Judah Halevi (c.1075-1141) emphasized:
- God's attributes revealed through historical intervention
- The God of Abraham rather than the philosophers' abstract God
- Divine attributes known through revelation and experience

## Kabbalistic Understanding

Jewish mysticism offers a complex understanding of divine attributes:

### Sefirot as Divine Qualities

The Kabbalah describes ten sefirot (divine emanations) manifesting God's attributes:
- **Keter** (Crown) - Divine will and transcendence
- **Chochmah** (Wisdom) - Beginning of conscious thought
- **Binah** (Understanding) - Processing and comprehension
- **Chesed** (Loving-kindness) - Boundless love and mercy
- **Gevurah** (Strength) - Judgment and restraint
- **Tiferet** (Beauty) - Harmony and compassion
- **Netzach** (Victory) - Endurance and triumph
- **Hod** (Splendor) - Humility and gratitude
- **Yesod** (Foundation) - Connection and continuity
- **Malchut** (Kingdom) - Divine presence in the world

The sefirot represent how God's infinite light becomes manifest in creation while maintaining God's essential unity.

## Rabbinic Perspectives

The Talmud and midrashic literature offer numerous perspectives on divine attributes:

### God's Attributes of Justice and Mercy

Rabbinic literature often distinguishes between:
- **Middat Hadin** - The attribute of justice/judgment
- **Middat Harachamim** - The attribute of mercy/compassion

These are not seen as contradictory but as complementary aspects of divine governance.

### Imitatio Dei: Ethical Implications

A key rabbinic teaching ties divine attributes to human ethics:
- "Just as God is gracious and compassionate, so you too should be gracious and compassionate" (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 133b)
- Divine attributes provide a model for human ethical behavior
- Humans are called to imitate God's attributes (imitatio dei)

## Liturgical Expressions

Jewish prayer expresses divine attributes through formulaic praise:

### The Amidah and Divine Attributes

The central Amidah prayer addresses God through specific attributes:
- "Great, mighty, and awesome God"
- "God who bestows good kindnesses"
- "Shield of Abraham"
- "The God who revives the dead"

These liturgical formulations shape the worshipper's conception of divine qualities.

## Modern Jewish Approaches

Contemporary Jewish thought has reinterpreted divine attributes:

### Martin Buber's I-Thou Relationship

Martin Buber (1878-1965) emphasized:
- God known through relationship rather than attributes
- The "eternal Thou" encountered through authentic dialogue
- Divine qualities experienced rather than intellectually defined

### Process Theology

Some modern Jewish thinkers have proposed more dynamic views:
- God's nature includes both unchanging and changing aspects
- Divine attributes respond to human actions and world events
- God experiences the world and is affected by it

### Feminist Re-evaluation

Jewish feminist theology has:
- Questioned exclusively masculine imagery for God
- Recovered biblical and rabbinic feminine divine attributes
- Expanded language for divine qualities beyond traditional formulations

## Theological Tensions

Several tensions exist in Jewish understanding of divine attributes:

### Transcendence vs. Immanence

- God as utterly beyond human comprehension vs. intimately involved with creation
- Divine unknowability vs. personal relationship
- Abstract perfection vs. responsive presence

### Justice vs. Mercy

- God as righteous judge vs. compassionate parent
- Strict accountability vs. loving forgiveness
- Consequences for actions vs. unconditional love

### Universality vs. Particularity

- God of all creation vs. God of Israel
- Divine concern for all humanity vs. special relationship with the Jewish people
- Universal ethical demands vs. particular covenantal obligations
