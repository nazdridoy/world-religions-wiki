# Divine Names in Judaism

![Hebrew script of God's name](divine_names_script.jpg)

In Judaism, the names used for God are far more than mere labels or identifiers—they represent profound theological concepts and reflect various aspects of the divine being, attributes, and relationship with humanity. Jewish tradition treats these names with immense reverence and has developed elaborate traditions regarding their pronunciation, writing, and interpretation.

## The Tetragrammaton: The Ineffable Name

### YHVH (יהוה)

The most sacred name of God in Judaism is the four-letter name known as the Tetragrammaton:
- Written with the Hebrew letters Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh (יהוה)
- Never pronounced as written in Jewish tradition since the destruction of the Temple
- Traditionally referred to as "Hashem" (The Name) or "Shem Hameforash" (The Explicit Name)

In liturgy and Torah readings, this name is pronounced as "Adonai" (My Lord), and in casual conversation, observant Jews often use substitutes like "Hashem" (The Name).

### Origins and Meaning

The Tetragrammaton first appears prominently in Exodus 3:13-15 when God reveals the name to Moses at the burning bush:
- Connected to the Hebrew root meaning "to be" (היה / הוה)
- Often interpreted as "I Am That I Am" (אהיה אשר אהיה / Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh)
- Suggests God's eternal, self-existent nature
- Indicates God's active presence in history

### Sanctity and Restrictions

Jewish law and tradition treat this name with the highest sanctity:
- Once spoken only by the High Priest on Yom Kippur in the Temple
- Written Torah scrolls containing this name cannot be destroyed or erased
- Many observant Jews write "G-d" in English to avoid the possibility of erasing or defacing the divine name
- Traditionally, scribes perform a ritual purification before writing this name in sacred texts

## Primary Divine Names

Judaism recognizes several main names of God, each with distinct theological significance:

### Elohim (אלהים)

- Grammatically plural form often used with singular verbs
- Generally associated with God's attribute of justice and divine judgment
- Used extensively in the creation narrative (Genesis 1)
- Also used for judges or mighty ones in some biblical contexts
- The singular form "El" often appears in biblical names (Isra-el, Samu-el)

### Adonai (אדני)

- Means "my Lord" or "my Master"
- Emphasizes God's sovereignty and lordship
- Used as the pronunciation substitute for the Tetragrammaton
- Reflects the relationship between God as master and humans as servants
- In prayer books, often printed with special formatting to indicate its sanctity

### El Shaddai (אל שדי)

- Traditionally translated as "God Almighty"
- The name by which God was known to the patriarchs before revealing the Tetragrammaton
- "I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as El Shaddai" (Exodus 6:3)
- Associated with God's power, fertility, and blessing
- Etymology possibly connected to "mountain" (שד) or "sufficiency"

### Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh (אהיה אשר אהיה)

- Revealed to Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3:14)
- Often translated as "I Am That I Am" or "I Will Be What I Will Be"
- Expresses God's self-existence and eternal being

## Historical Development

The understanding of divine names evolved through Jewish history:

### Biblical Period

- Different names prevalent in different textual sources
- Pre-Sinai revelation emphasized El, Elohim, El Shaddai
- Post-Sinai emphasis on the Tetragrammaton
- Royal metaphors (King, Judge) became prominent during monarchic period

### Rabbinic Period

- Increasing reluctance to pronounce the Tetragrammaton
- Development of substitute names and euphemisms
- Emphasis on God's accessibility through prayer despite transcendence
- Creation of liturgical formulae incorporating divine names

### Medieval Period

- Philosophical interpretation of names as attributes rather than proper names
- Kabbalistic elaboration of the cosmic significance of divine names
- Poetic explorations in liturgical poetry (piyyutim)
- Integration of philosophical and mystical approaches

## Liturgical Uses

Jewish prayer carefully employs divine names:

### Blessings Formula

- Standard blessing begins: "Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe..."
- The formula includes both the Tetragrammaton (pronounced Adonai) and Elohim
- Concludes with reference to the specific divine attribute being invoked

### Prayer Book Conventions

- Divine names printed with special typography or formatting

- Instructions for proper intention (kavanah) when pronouncing divine names

### Singing and Chanting

- Careful attention to proper pronunciation of divine names in cantillation
- Some musical traditions have special melodies reserved for passages containing divine names
- Careful treatment of texts set to music containing divine names

## Contemporary Approaches

Modern Jewish movements have developed varied approaches to divine names:

### Feminist Reinterpretations

- Questioning exclusively masculine God-language
- Development of feminine or gender-neutral divine names
- Recovery of feminine aspects like Shekhinah (divine presence)
- Supplementing traditional names with inclusive alternatives

### Denominational Differences

- **Orthodox**: Maintains traditional reverence and restrictions regarding divine names
- **Conservative**: Generally follows traditional practices while allowing some innovation
- **Reform/Reconstructionist**: More open to reinterpretation and innovation in God-language
- **Renewal**: Draws on mystical traditions while incorporating contemporary concerns

### Translation Issues

- Challenges in rendering Hebrew divine names in modern translations
- Some translations use "LORD" for the Tetragrammaton following ancient tradition
- Others use "Eternal," "Eternal One," or transliterations like "Adonai"
- Increased sensitivity to gender implications in translated names
