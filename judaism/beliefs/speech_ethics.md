# Speech Ethics - Proper Use of Language

![Words and their power](speech_ethics.jpg)

Judaism places extraordinary emphasis on ethical speech, recognizing the profound power of language to heal or harm, unite or divide, uplift or destroy. Jewish tradition developed an elaborate system of speech ethics centered on concepts like lashon hara (harmful speech) and ona'at devarim (verbal mistreatment), establishing guidelines that regulate personal conversation, public discourse, business communication, and contemporary media engagement.

## Biblical Foundations

### Prohibitions Against Harmful Speech

The Torah establishes fundamental principles:

- **Prohibition of Slander**: "You shall not go about as a talebearer among your people" (Leviticus 19:16)
- **Prohibition of Cursing**: "You shall not curse the deaf" (Leviticus 19:14)
- **Guarding One's Speech**: "Guard your tongue from evil" (Psalms 34:14)
- **Obligation of Honesty**: "Distance yourself from falsehood" (Exodus 23:7)
- **Avoiding Embarrassment**: Numerous examples warning against shaming others

### Positive Speech Obligations

The Bible also establishes affirmative speech duties:

- **Truthfulness**: "Speak truth to one another" (Zechariah 8:16)
- **Judicious Speech**: "The wise of heart shall be called a person of discernment, and sweetness of speech increases persuasiveness" (Proverbs 16:21)
- **Comforting Words**: Obligation to console mourners and the distressed
- **Constructive Criticism**: "You shall surely rebuke your neighbor" (Leviticus 19:17)
- **Mindful Communication**: "The heart of the righteous contemplates how to answer" (Proverbs 15:28)

### Biblical Examples

Narrative sections illustrate speech ethics:

- Miriam's punishment for speaking against Moses (Numbers 12)
- The consequence of the spies' negative report (Numbers 13-14)
- Harmful gossip during Korach's rebellion (Numbers 16)
- Joseph's brothers' deceptive speech to Jacob
- David's regret over his words to Naval (1 Samuel 25)

## Rabbinic Development

### Categories of Prohibited Speech

The rabbis elaborated detailed categories:

- **Lashon Hara**: Truthful but unnecessary negative speech about others
- **Rechilut**: Talebearing or gossip between parties
- **Motzi Shem Ra**: Spreading falsehoods that damage reputation
- **Ona'at Devarim**: Verbal mistreatment or causing emotional pain
- **Avak Lashon Hara**: "Dust" of harmful speech - indirect negative implications

### Conditions and Exceptions

Talmudic discussions addressed complexities:

- When harmful information may be shared to prevent harm
- Requirements for constructive criticism (tochecha)
- The "dust of lashon hara" - implying negative information
- Responsibility for speech that might be misinterpreted
- Permissibility of necessary business or educational information

### Communal Dimensions

The rabbis emphasized social consequences:

- Lashon hara as destroyer of communities
- Responsibility of listeners as well as speakers
- Community leadership selection based partly on speech habits
- Talmudic stories illustrating severe spiritual consequences of gossip
