# Prophecy in Judaism

![Hebrew prophet with scroll](prophet_scroll.jpg)

Prophecy (nevuah in Hebrew) occupies a central place in Jewish religious thought as the primary mode of divine communication with humanity. The prophetic tradition—spanning from Abraham through the classical prophets of the Bible—established the foundation for Judaism's understanding of God's will, shaped Jewish ethical teachings, and provided both warning and comfort to the Jewish people throughout their history.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Definition and Nature

In Jewish understanding, prophecy involves:
- Direct divine communication to a human recipient
- Selection of the prophet by God rather than self-appointment
- The prophet as messenger delivering God's word
- A state of consciousness distinct from ordinary awareness
- Communication primarily for guidance rather than prediction

Unlike divination or fortune-telling in other ancient cultures, Jewish prophecy was centered on moral and spiritual guidance rather than merely foretelling future events.

### Types of Prophetic Experience

The rabbinic tradition identifies several forms of prophetic experience:
- Dream visions during sleep
- Waking visions or trances
- Auditory messages without visual components
- Symbolic actions commanded by God
- Inspiration through the divine spirit (ruach hakodesh)
- Direct "face to face" communication (uniquely attributed to Moses)

## Biblical Prophets

The Hebrew Bible presents a rich prophetic tradition:

### Major Categories

- **The Patriarchs**: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob received divine communications
- **Moses**: Considered the greatest prophet, who spoke with God "face to face"
- **Early Prophets**: Samuel, Nathan, Elijah, and Elisha
- **Literary Prophets**: Those whose oracles were preserved in biblical books
  - **Major Prophets**: Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel
  - **Twelve Minor Prophets**: Hosea through Malachi

### Prophetic Mission

Biblical prophets carried out several crucial functions:
- Delivering God's messages to the people and leadership
- Calling Israel back to covenant faithfulness
- Criticizing social and economic injustice
- Warning of consequences for national sin
- Providing comfort and hope during national crises
- Keeping the vision of redemption alive during exile

### Prophetic Call Narratives

Many prophets describe their initial calling:
- Moses and the burning bush (Exodus 3)
- Isaiah's vision in the Temple (Isaiah 6)
- Jeremiah's appointment before birth (Jeremiah 1)
- Ezekiel's complex vision of the divine chariot (Ezekiel 1)
- Amos as a simple shepherd taken from his flock (Amos 7:14-15)

These accounts often include the prophet's reluctance and sense of unworthiness.

## Rabbinic Understanding

After the biblical period, the rabbis developed a systematic theology of prophecy:

### Requirements for Prophecy

The Talmud and Maimonides outline prerequisites:
- Wisdom and intellectual preparation
- Moral and spiritual refinement
- Emotional self-control
- Physical health and strength
- Proper mental preparation

According to Maimonides, prophecy was not purely supernatural but required human cultivation and divine selection.

### Levels of Prophecy

Maimonides in the Guide for the Perplexed identified eleven degrees of prophecy:
- The lowest levels involve divine inspiration and dreams
- Middle levels include hearing voices and seeing angelic messengers
- Higher levels involve clear symbolic visions
- The highest level, attained only by Moses, involved direct divine communication

### The End of Prophecy

The Talmud states that prophecy ended with the last biblical prophets:
- "After the latter prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi died, the Holy Spirit departed from Israel" (Sanhedrin 11a)
- The "divine voice" (bat kol) remained as a lesser form of revelation
- Torah interpretation through scholarly methods replaced direct revelation
- Rabbinic authority succeeded prophetic authority

## Theological Dimensions

Prophecy raises profound theological questions:

### Divine-Human Communication

- How does the infinite God communicate with finite humans?
- Is prophetic language literal or metaphorical?
- How is divine truth translated into human language?
- Do prophets maintain their individuality and style?
- What mediates between divine transcendence and human limitation?

### Verification of Prophecy

The tradition established criteria for authentic prophecy:
- Consistency with Torah principles
- Fulfilled predictions (with exceptions for prophecies of punishment)
- The prophet's moral character
- The consensus of the community
- The prohibition against prophesying in the name of other gods

### Free Will and Determinism

Prophecy raises questions about human freedom:
- Are prophetic predictions deterministic?
- Can prophesied events be altered by repentance?
- The story of Jonah suggests prophecies of doom are conditional
- The tension between divine foreknowledge and human choice
- The role of human response to prophetic warning

## Prophetic Ethics

A distinctive feature of Jewish prophecy is its ethical focus:

### Social Justice Emphasis

Hebrew prophets consistently demanded:
- Care for the vulnerable (widows, orphans, strangers)
- Economic justice and opposition to exploitation
- Honest weights and measures in commerce
- Land rights and opposition to monopolizing resources
- Critique of luxury and excess amid poverty

### Ritual vs. Moral Behavior

Prophets often prioritized ethics over ritual:
- "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6)
- Isaiah's critique of fasting without justice (Isaiah 58)
- Amos's rejection of festivals amid injustice (Amos 5:21-24)
- Micah's summary: "Do justice, love kindness, walk humbly" (Micah 6:8)
- The balance between ritual and ethical demands

### Universal Vision

Prophetic ethics extended beyond Israel:
- God's concern for all nations
- Universal peace as the ultimate goal
- Ethical monotheism extending to all humanity
- Accountability of all peoples to basic moral standards
- Israel's mission to be a "light to nations"

## Prophetic Messages

Several themes dominate prophetic literature:

### Covenant Faithfulness

- Call to return to the Sinai covenant
- Metaphor of marriage between God and Israel
- Infidelity to God as spiritual adultery
- The pain of divine rejection reflecting broken relationship
- Promise of reconciliation and covenant renewal

### Historical Judgment

- National calamities interpreted as divine response to sin
- The concept of the "Day of the LORD" as divine judgment
- Foreign powers as instruments of divine purpose
- The fall of Jerusalem as fulfillment of prophetic warning
- Exile as purification rather than final rejection

### Messianic Hope

- Future redemption through a righteous leader
- Restoration of Davidic dynasty
- Ingathering of exiles
- Renewal of the land
- Universal peace and divine knowledge

### The Remnant

- The concept of a faithful minority
- Purification through suffering
- The "remnant of Israel" as seed for future restoration
- Quality over quantity in divine purpose
- The faithful few carrying forward the covenant

## Philosophical Interpretations

Medieval Jewish philosophers developed sophisticated theories of prophecy:

### Maimonides' Naturalistic Approach

Moses Maimonides (1138-1204) proposed:
- Prophecy as natural human potential requiring divine selection
- The role of the imaginative faculty in receiving divine overflow
- The active intellect as intermediary between God and prophet
- Prophetic imagery as translation of intellectual concepts
- The uniqueness of Mosaic prophecy in bypassing imagination

### Judah Halevi's Particularistic View

Judah Halevi (c.1075-1141) emphasized:
- Prophecy as special gift to the Jewish people
- The Land of Israel as uniquely conducive to prophecy
- Divine factor (al-amr al-ilahi) rather than natural capacity
- Prophecy as experiential rather than intellectual
- The superiority of prophetic knowledge over philosophical reasoning

### Gersonides' Theory

Levi ben Gershon (1288-1344) proposed:
- Prophecy as involving natural human intellectual capacity
- The role of the acquired intellect in prophecy
- The prophet's preparation through study and contemplation
- Limitations of prophetic knowledge regarding particulars
- Varying levels of clarity in prophetic vision

## Women as Prophets

The tradition acknowledges female prophetic voices:

### Biblical Female Prophets

The tradition identifies seven biblical women prophets:
- Sarah - Abraham's wife
- Miriam - Moses's sister
- Deborah - Judge and military leader
- Hannah - Mother of Samuel
- Abigail - Wife of David
- Huldah - Consulted about the discovered Torah scroll
- Esther - Heroine of Purim story

### Distinctive Aspects

Rabbinic tradition notes several patterns:
- Women prophets often operated outside formal structures
- Some served as consultants to male leadership
- Many combined prophecy with political leadership
- Their authority was sometimes questioned or limited
- Their stories often involve domestic as well as public spheres

## Post-Biblical Developments

Though formal prophecy was considered ended, related phenomena continued:

### Mystical Experiences

- Merkavah mystics sought visions similar to Ezekiel's
- Kabbalistic revelation through heavenly messengers
- Prophetic-like experiences reported by various mystics
- The Maggid of Joseph Karo delivering teachings
- Hasidic rebbes receiving divine guidance

### Ruach Hakodesh

The concept of "divine inspiration" (ruach hakodesh) continued:
- Lesser form of divine communication than prophecy
- Granted to particularly righteous individuals
- Manifested as special insight or foresight
- Not considered authoritative like biblical prophecy
- Present in inspired Torah interpretation

## Modern Interpretations

Contemporary Jewish thought has reinterpreted prophecy:

### Psychological Approaches

- Martin Buber: Prophecy as intense I-Thou encounter
- Abraham Joshua Heschel: Prophetic consciousness as sharing divine pathos
- Prophecy understood as heightened moral and spiritual awareness
- The prophet's empathic identification with both God and humanity
- Psychological understanding of prophetic states

### Political and Social Interpretations

- Prophets as early social critics and political activists
- The prophetic tradition as basis for Jewish social justice work
- The concept of "speaking truth to power" derived from prophetic model
- Application of prophetic critique to modern economic systems
- Environmental justice rooted in prophetic vision

### Denominational Perspectives

- **Orthodox**: Maintains traditional understanding of prophecy's historical reality
- **Conservative**: Balances traditional view with historical-critical insights
- **Reform**: Emphasizes the ethical legacy of prophetic tradition
- **Reconstructionist**: Views prophecy as expression of Jewish civilization's highest values

## Contemporary Relevance
