Jewish medical ethics represents a sophisticated system applying traditional Jewish values, texts, and legal reasoning to complex bioethical questions. This field demonstrates Judaism's integration of religious wisdom with medical science, creating a framework that honors both the sanctity of human life and the importance of healing while navigating the challenging ethical terrain of modern medicine.

## Foundational Principles
