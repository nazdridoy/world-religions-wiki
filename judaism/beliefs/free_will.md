# Free Will (Bechirah Chofshit)

![Representation of choice](free_will.jpg)

Free will (bechirah chofshit) is a foundational concept in Jewish thought that affirms human moral agency and responsibility. Judaism generally maintains that despite divine foreknowledge and involvement in human affairs, individuals possess genuine freedom to make moral choices and are accountable for those decisions.

## Biblical Foundations

### Freedom to Choose

The Torah explicitly presents moral choice as central to human existence:

> "See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil... blessings and curses. Choose life, that you and your offspring shall live." (Deuteronomy 30:15-19)

Other key biblical expressions of free will include:

- Adam and Eve's choice to eat from the forbidden tree
- Cain being told he can "rule over" his evil inclination
- The Israelites' choice to accept the covenant at Sinai
- Joshua's challenge: "Choose this day whom you will serve"
- Recurring calls to choose between obedience and disobedience

### Divine Knowledge and Human Choice

The Bible presents an inherent tension between:

- God's omniscience and foreknowledge
- Human freedom and responsibility
- Divine plans and human agency

This tension is exemplified in narratives like Joseph's brothers selling him into slavery (presented both as their evil choice and as part of God's plan) and Pharaoh's hardened heart (described both as his choice and God's action).

## Rabbinic Development

### Talmudic Perspectives

The rabbis of the Talmudic era strongly affirmed free will:

> "Everything is foreseen [by God], yet freedom of choice is granted." (Pirkei Avot 3:15)

Several principles emerged from rabbinic literature:

1. Humans possess genuine freedom in moral choices
2. Divine foreknowledge does not negate free will
3. Reward and punishment presuppose moral agency
4. The evil inclination (yetzer hara) can be overcome
5. Repentance (teshuvah) is always possible

### The Two Impulses

Rabbinic psychology developed the concept of competing inclinations:

- **Yetzer HaTov** - The good inclination, emerging at maturity
- **Yetzer HaRa** - The evil inclination, present from birth

Rather than viewing the evil inclination as purely negative, the rabbis saw it as:
- Necessary for human creativity and productivity
- The source of competitive drive and ambition
- Essential for procreation and survival
- Something to be channeled, not eliminated

> "Were it not for the evil inclination, no one would build a house, marry, have children, or engage in commerce." (Genesis Rabbah 9:7)

## Philosophical Approaches

### Medieval Formulations

Jewish philosophers addressed free will systematically:

**Saadia Gaon (882-942)**
- Affirmed absolute free will in moral matters
- Argued that divine knowledge of future choices doesn't cause them
- Distinguished between divine foreknowledge (which is passive) and divine causation

**Maimonides (1138-1204)**
- Considered free will an axiom of Jewish thought
- Rejected any notion of predestination
- Explained divine foreknowledge as transcending time
- Stated: "Free will is granted to every human being... to become righteous or wicked" (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance 5:1)

**Hasdai Crescas (1340-1410)**
- Challenged absolute free will
- Argued that human actions are determined by prior causes
- Maintained moral responsibility based on internal causation

### Later Developments

**Isaac Luria (1534-1572)** and Kabbalistic thought:
- Introduced the concept of tzimtzum (divine contraction)
- Created space for genuine human freedom
- Viewed human choice as participating in cosmic repair (tikkun olam)

**Moses Chaim Luzzatto (1707-1746)**:
- Systematized free will in his work "Path of the Just"
- Described free will as the ongoing moral battleground of human experience
- Emphasized practical methods to strengthen moral choice

## Theological Tensions

### Divine Omniscience

Jewish thinkers have proposed several approaches to reconcile divine foreknowledge with human freedom:

1. **Transcendence solution**: God's knowledge exists outside time and doesn't interfere with choice
2. **Knowledge without causation**: God knows what we will choose without causing the choice
3. **Open future view**: Some modern thinkers suggest God knows all possibilities but the future is genuinely open
4. **Mystery approach**: The reconciliation transcends human understanding

### Providence and Choice

Judaism affirms both divine providence (hashgacha) and human freedom through several frameworks:

- Divine guidance operates at a macro level while preserving micro-level freedom
- Providence works through rather than against natural processes
- The extent of direct divine involvement may vary based on righteousness
- Human partnership with divine purposes preserves both agency and providence

## Contemporary Perspectives

### Scientific Challenges

Modern Jewish thought engages with scientific perspectives on free will:

- Neurological determinism and brain sciences
- Genetic predispositions and behavioral tendencies
- Psychological insights about unconscious motivation
- Environmental and social determinants of behavior

**Responses include:**
- Distinguishing between physical causation and moral freedom
- Identifying spaces for moral choice even within constraints
- Reframing free will as working with rather than against our nature
- Emphasizing that increased self-knowledge enhances rather than diminishes freedom

### Modern Jewish Approaches

Contemporary Jewish thinkers have contributed distinctive perspectives:

- **Joseph Soloveitchik**: Free will as part of humanity's creative dignity
- **Abraham Joshua Heschel**: Freedom as responding to divine pathos
- **Emmanuel Levinas**: Ethical freedom emerging in response to the Other
- **Mordecai Kaplan**: Freedom as function of human consciousness within a naturalistic framework
- **Eugene Borowitz**: Freedom within covenant as defining Jewish theology

## Practical Implications

### Moral Responsibility

Jewish emphasis on free will establishes:
- Personal accountability for actions
- The possibility and obligation of moral improvement
- Responsibility for communal welfare
- The requirement to resist external pressure to wrongdoing
- The importance of moral education

### Teshuvah (Repentance)

Free will makes teshuvah (repentance/return) possible:
- Recognition of wrongdoing as one's own choice
- Genuine possibility of change
- Taking responsibility rather than making excuses
- Freedom to make different choices in the future
- Divine forgiveness predicated on human agency

### Character Development

Free will supports Jewish approaches to moral growth:
- Development of middot (ethical character traits)
- Establishing habitual patterns of righteous behavior
- Creating "fences" to avoid temptation
- Communal structures supporting ethical choices
- Mindful practices to strengthen moral awareness
