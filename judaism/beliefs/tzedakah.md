# Tzedakah: Righteous Giving

![Tzedakah box with coins](tzedakah.jpg)

Tzedakah (צְדָקָה) is the Hebrew term for the religious obligation to do what is right and just, most commonly expressed through charitable giving and acts that promote social equity. Unlike the English word "charity," which suggests voluntary benevolence, tzedakah in Judaism is considered a religious obligation and a matter of justice rather than generosity alone.

## Conceptual Foundation

### Etymology and Meaning

The word tzedakah derives from the Hebrew root צדק (tz-d-k), meaning:

- Righteousness
- Justice
- Fairness
- What is right

This etymology reveals that tzedakah is fundamentally about creating a more just world rather than merely alleviating immediate suffering. It reflects the Jewish understanding that helping those in need is not optional generosity but rather the fulfillment of a moral obligation to create a just society.

### Religious Obligation

Tzedakah is considered a mitzvah (commandment) in Judaism, based on several Torah sources:

- "If there is a poor man among your brothers... you shall not harden your heart, nor close your hand from your poor brother" (Deuteronomy 15:7)
- "You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor, and to your needy, in your land" (Deuteronomy 15:11)
- "The righteous gives and does not hold back" (Proverbs 21:26)

Unlike voluntary charity, tzedakah is understood as:

- An obligation incumbent upon all Jews
- Required even from those who themselves receive tzedakah
- A basic expression of religious devotion
- A means of creating a just and equitable society

## Historical Development

### Biblical Origins

The Torah established several agricultural and economic practices that constituted early forms of tzedakah:

- **Pe'ah** - Leaving the corners of fields unharvested for the poor (Leviticus 19:9)
- **Leket** - Leaving dropped grain for the needy (Leviticus 19:9)
- **Ma'aser Ani** - The tithe for the poor in the third and sixth years of the seven-year agricultural cycle (Deuteronomy 14:28-29)
- **Shemitah** - The sabbatical year when debts were forgiven and fields left fallow for all to gather from (Deuteronomy 15:1-11)
- **Yovel** - The Jubilee year when ancestral lands were returned and slaves freed (Leviticus 25)

These practices created a systematic approach to addressing poverty and preventing extreme inequality.

### Rabbinic Development

After the destruction of the Temple and the shift to diaspora life, the rabbis developed a comprehensive framework for tzedakah:

- Codified percentage-based giving (generally one-tenth to one-fifth of income)
- Established the communal tzedakah fund (kupah) for systematic distribution
- Articulated detailed laws regarding priorities in giving
- Emphasized the dignity of recipients
- Extended the concept beyond monetary giving to include various forms of assistance

### Medieval Period

During the medieval period, Jewish communities formalized tzedakah through various institutions:

- Communal funds administered by designated officials
- Special collections for specific needs (ransoming captives, dowries for poor brides)
- Mutual aid societies addressing particular community needs
- Strong social pressure to participate in communal giving
- Ethical writings emphasizing the spiritual significance of tzedakah

## Principles and Guidelines

### Maimonides' Eight Levels

Maimonides (Rambam), the 12th-century philosopher and legal authority, famously outlined eight levels of tzedakah in ascending order of virtue:

1. Giving unwillingly, grudgingly, or inadequately
2. Giving willingly but less than one should
3. Giving adequately after being asked
4. Giving before being asked
5. Giving when the donor knows the recipient but the recipient doesn't know the donor
6. Giving when the recipient knows the donor but the donor doesn't know the recipient
7. Giving when neither the donor nor the recipient knows the other's identity
8. The highest form: Helping a person become self-sufficient through a gift, loan, partnership, or helping them find employment

This hierarchy emphasizes the importance of:
- Preserving the dignity of the recipient
- Giving proactively rather than reactively
- Ultimate goal of helping others achieve independence

### Key Principles

Jewish law and tradition establish several key principles regarding tzedakah:

- **Universal Obligation**: Everyone must give according to their means, even the poor
- **Proportionality**: Giving should be proportional to one's wealth (ideally 10-20% of income)
- **Local Priority**: One's local community generally takes precedence
- **Family First**: Relatives in need have priority over strangers
- **Immediate Needs**: Life-threatening situations take absolute priority
- **Sustainability**: Supporting self-sufficiency is preferable to ongoing dependency
- **Verification**: Donors have responsibility to ensure funds are used appropriately
- **Confidentiality**: Protecting the dignity of recipients whenever possible

## Practical Applications

Tzedakah encompasses many forms of giving:

- **Monetary Gifts**: Direct financial support to individuals or organizations
- **Food and Necessities**: Providing basic sustenance and material needs
- **Time and Service**: Volunteering skills and labor for community benefit
- **Employment**: Creating jobs or helping others find work
- **Interest-Free Loans**: Gemach (free loan societies) for various needs
- **Hospitality**: Opening one's home to those in need
- **Medical Assistance**: Supporting healthcare for those who cannot afford it
- **Education**: Funding schools and scholarship funds

### Tzedakah Instruments

Various physical objects and institutions facilitate tzedakah practice:

- **Tzedakah Box** (pushke): Container in homes and synagogues for collecting funds
- **Communal Funds**: Organized charitable foundations serving specific purposes
- **Perpetual Funds**: Endowments that provide ongoing support
- **Synagogue Pledges**: Regular commitments to community institutions

### Timing and Occasions

Tzedakah is integrated into the rhythm of Jewish life:

- **Life Cycle Events**: Giving associated with births, bar/bat mitzvahs, weddings, and deaths
- **Yahrzeits** (death anniversaries): Custom of giving in memory of loved ones
- **Fast Days**: Tradition of donating the value of uneaten food
- **Purim**: Obligation of *matanot l'evyonim* (gifts to the poor)

## Theological Dimensions

### Divine Imitation

Tzedakah is understood as imitating God's attributes:

- "Follow the Lord your God" (Deuteronomy 13:5) is interpreted as imitating divine qualities
- God is described as caring for the vulnerable: "who executes justice for the orphan and widow, and loves the stranger, giving them food and clothing" (Deuteronomy 10:18)
- By giving tzedakah, humans become partners in God's work of sustaining creation

### Spiritual Effects

Jewish tradition associates tzedakah with profound spiritual benefits:

- "Tzedakah delivers from death" (Proverbs 10:2)
- "Tzedakah and acts of kindness are equivalent to all the mitzvot of the Torah" (Jerusalem Talmud, Pe'ah 1:1)
- "The reward for tzedakah is directly proportional to the kindness with which it is given" (Talmud, Sukkah 49b)
- "More than the wealthy person does for the poor, the poor person does for the wealthy" (recognizing the spiritual opportunity giving provides)

### Social Vision

Tzedakah expresses Judaism's vision of an ideal society:

- Addressing systemic inequities rather than merely temporary relief
- Recognizing human interdependence and mutual responsibility
- Balancing individual property rights with communal obligations
- Creating structures that prevent extreme inequality
- Ensuring basic dignity and sufficiency for all community members
