# God in Jewish Philosophy

![Medieval Jewish philosopher studying texts](jewish_philosopher.jpg)

Throughout history, Jewish thinkers have engaged in philosophical exploration of the nature of God, seeking to harmonize revelation with reason and articulate the concept of divinity in intellectual terms. This philosophical approach to God has played a crucial role in shaping Jewish theology, enabling dialogue with other intellectual traditions while maintaining Judaism's distinctive monotheistic vision.

## Early Philosophical Approaches

### Philo of Alexandria

Philo (c. 20 BCE - c. 50 CE) represented the first major attempt to synthesize Jewish and Greek philosophical thought:
- Interpreted the God of Israel through Platonic concepts
- Described God as utterly transcendent and beyond comprehension
- Introduced the concept of the Logos as an intermediary between God and creation
- Rejected anthropomorphic interpretations of biblical texts
- Emphasized God's incorporeality and immutability

### Rabbinic Rational Elements

While not systematic philosophers, the rabbis of the Talmud incorporated philosophical elements:
- Balanced particularistic understanding with universalistic conceptions
- Acknowledged limitations of human knowledge about God
- Preferred ethical descriptions over metaphysical speculation
- Engaged with Greco-Roman philosophical ideas selectively
- Maintained primacy of revelation while making room for reason

## Medieval Jewish Philosophy

The medieval period saw the flowering of systematic Jewish philosophical thought about God:

### Saadia Gaon (882-942)

As the first systematic Jewish philosopher, Saadia in his "Book of Beliefs and Opinions":
- Argued for the rational necessity of God's existence
- Identified God's unity as absolute and indivisible
- Defended creation ex nihilo (from nothing)
- Distinguished between essential and active divine attributes
- Reconciled divine foreknowledge with human free will

### Judah Halevi (c.1075-1141)

In his "Kuzari," Halevi developed a distinctive approach:
- Distinguished between the "God of Abraham" and "God of Aristotle"
- Prioritized revelation and historical experience over abstract reason
- Argued for the superiority of prophetic knowledge over philosophical speculation
- Emphasized God's personal relationship with Israel
- Maintained God's active involvement in history

### Maimonides (1138-1204)

Moses Maimonides revolutionized Jewish philosophical theology in his "Guide for the Perplexed":

#### Negative Theology

- Argued that positive attributes cannot properly apply to God
- Developed a theology of what God is not rather than what God is
- Maintained that divine attributes describe God's actions not essence
- Rejected any form of anthropomorphism as compromising God's unity
- Insisted on the utter uniqueness and simplicity of God's essence

#### Proofs for God's Existence

Maimonides adapted Aristotelian arguments:
- Argument from motion to an unmoved mover
- Argument from causation to a first cause
- Argument from contingency to necessary existence
- Argument from gradation of perfection

#### Divine Knowledge and Providence

- God's knowledge is non-human and encompasses all particulars
- Divine providence corresponds to intellectual/spiritual development
- God knows future contingent events without causing them
- Natural causation as the usual mode of divine governance
- Miracles as rare exceptions built into creation from the beginning

### Gersonides (1288-1344)

Levi ben Gershon challenged some Maimonidean positions:
- Limited God's knowledge of future contingent events
- Argued that divine knowledge of particulars is possible
- Rejected creation ex nihilo in favor of creation from primordial matter
- Maintained God's essential attributes do not compromise divine unity
- Developed a more limited view of divine providence

### Hasdai Crescas (c.1340-1410/11)

Crescas criticized Aristotelian influence on Jewish theology:
- Challenged Maimonides' negative theology
- Affirmed positive divine attributes like goodness and love
- Rejected the intellectualist approach to divine-human relationship
- Defended God's ability to know particulars directly
- Emphasized divine will and infinite power over intellect

## Modern Jewish Philosophical Theology

The modern period brought new approaches to understanding God:

### Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786)

As a key figure of the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah):
- Defended traditional monotheism in modern philosophical terms
- Harmonized religious belief with rational thought
- Distinguished between eternal religious truths and changing historical practices
- Emphasized rationality of Jewish monotheism
- Promoted natural theology compatible with revealed religion

### Hermann Cohen (1842-1918)

As founder of Neo-Kantianism, Cohen:
- Reinterpreted God as the guarantor of moral ideals
- Developed "religion of reason" from Jewish sources
- Rejected metaphysical conceptions in favor of ethical meaning
- Saw God as the ground of the possibility of ethics
- Emphasized correlation between human and divine

### Franz Rosenzweig (1886-1929)

Rosenzweig's "Star of Redemption" presented:
- God as one element of the triadic structure of reality (God, world, humanity)
- Critique of philosophical abstractions in favor of relational theology
- God known through revelation and relationship rather than reason
- Emphasis on divine love as central to understanding God
- Theological existentialism rooted in Jewish sources

### Martin Buber (1878-1965)

Buber's dialogical philosophy proposed:
- God as the "Eternal Thou" encountered in authentic relation
- Rejection of God as an object of knowledge or belief
- Divine-human relationship as model for all genuine relationships
- Critique of both traditional theology and secular philosophy
- God's presence in the "between" of genuine encounters

### Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972)

Heschel developed a phenomenology of religious experience:
- God's "pathos" or concern for humanity
- Divine need for human partnership
- Emphasis on prophetic consciousness of divine concern
- Wonder and radical amazement as responses to divine reality
- Faith as an answer to ultimate questions

## Key Philosophical Problems

Jewish philosophers have wrestled with several persistent questions:

### Divine Unity and Attributes

- How can God have attributes while remaining absolutely one?
- Are attributes real or merely ways humans perceive God?
- Can human language meaningfully describe the divine?
- How to balance kataphatic (positive) and apophatic (negative) theology?
- Are divine attributes essential or merely descriptions of actions?

### Creation and Divine Freedom

- Did God create freely or by necessity?
- Is creation eternal or temporal?
- How does God relate to space and time?
- What is the purpose of creation?
- How can a perfect God create an imperfect world?

### Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom

- How can God know future free actions without determining them?
- Is divine omniscience compatible with genuine human choice?
- Different proposed solutions:
  - Maimonides: God's knowledge differs fundamentally from human knowledge
  - Gersonides: God knows all possibilities but not which will be actualized
  - Crescas: Divine knowledge does not impose necessity

### God and Evil

- How can evil exist in a world created by a perfect, omnipotent God?
- Various approaches:
  - Evil as absence of good (privation theory)
  - Evil as necessary for free will (soul-making theodicy)
  - Evil as necessarily limited in a created world
  - Post-Holocaust reconsiderations of traditional theodicy

## Philosophical Approaches Across Denominations

Contemporary Jewish movements approach philosophical theology differently:

### Orthodox Approaches

- Commitment to traditional doctrines while engaging with modern thought
- Joseph B. Soloveitchik: Existential approach to divine-human relationship
- Eliezer Berkovits: God's self-limitation allowing human freedom
- Neo-Aristotelian approaches maintaining rational theology
- Integration of philosophical and mystical concepts

### Conservative Movement

- Greater openness to modern philosophical critiques
- Balance between tradition and contemporary thought
- Process theology influences (e.g., Max Kadushin)
- Natural theology compatible with scientific understanding
- Revelation as ongoing dialogical process

### Reform and Reconstructionist Approaches

- Reform: Ethical monotheism emphasizing God's moral significance
- Reconstructionist: God as "power that makes for salvation" (Kaplan)
- Non-supernatural interpretations of divine activity
- God-language as metaphorical rather than literal
- Emphasis on divine immanence over transcendence

## Contemporary Philosophical Trends

Several developments characterize recent Jewish philosophical theology:

### Post-Holocaust Theology

- Richard Rubenstein: Death of the God of history
- Emil Fackenheim: The commanding voice from Auschwitz
- Eliezer Berkovits: Divine self-limitation and hiddenness
- Reexamination of divine omnipotence and providence
- Theological responses to radical evil

### Feminist Jewish Philosophy

- Critique of exclusively masculine God-language
- Recovery of feminine divine imagery from tradition
- Judith Plaskow: Standing Again at Sinai
- Rachel Adler: Engendering Judaism
- Tamar Ross: Expanding the Palace of Torah
- Philosophical analysis of gender in Jewish God-concepts

### Process Theology

- God as affected by and responsive to the world

- Omnipotence reinterpreted as maximum possible influence
- Reality as dynamic and relational
- Bradley Shavit Artson: God of Becoming and Relationship

### Jewish Contributions to Analytic Philosophy of Religion

- Jewish participation in contemporary analytical philosophy
- Kenneth Seeskin on Maimonides and modern thought
- Jerome Gellman on mystical experience and rationality
- David Shatz on divine knowledge and free will
- Integration of traditional Jewish concepts with analytic precision
