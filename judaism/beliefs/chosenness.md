# Chosenness: The Concept of the Chosen People

![Torah scroll with pointer](chosenness.jpg)

The concept of chosenness (בְּחִירָה - *bechirah*) refers to the Jewish belief that God has selected the people of Israel for a particular covenant relationship and religious purpose. This idea of Jewish election, derived from several biblical passages, has been interpreted in multiple ways throughout Jewish history and remains a complex theological concept that balances notions of distinctiveness and responsibility.

## Biblical Foundations

### Key Texts

Several Torah passages establish the concept of chosenness:

- **Exodus 19:5-6**: "Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession (*am segulah*). Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation."

- **Deuteronomy 7:6-8**: "For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you (*bachar*) out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession. The Lord did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. But it was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors..."

- **Deuteronomy 14:2**: "For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. Out of all the peoples on the face of the earth, the Lord has chosen you to be his treasured possession."

- **Isaiah 42:6**: "I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light to the nations."

### Contextual Understanding

Biblical scholars note several important aspects of these passages:

- Chosenness is consistently presented as stemming from God's love and faithfulness to ancestral promises, not from Israel's merit or superiority
- Election is always connected to covenant responsibility and ethical demands
- The purpose often extends beyond Israel to impact other nations positively
- Selection is tied to the specific mission of maintaining monotheism and ethical living

## Historical Development of the Concept

### Rabbinic Interpretation

The rabbinic tradition developed several perspectives on chosenness:

- The Talmud (Avodah Zarah 2b-3a) depicts God offering the Torah to all nations, with only Israel accepting it
- Midrashic sources portray Israel as chosen because they were willing to accept the obligations of the covenant
- The siddur (prayer book) refers to God "who chose us from all peoples and gave us His Torah"
- Rabbinic texts emphasize that chosenness entails greater responsibility and judgment, not privilege

Rabbi Yehuda Halevi (12th century) wrote in the Kuzari: "We are to other nations like the heart to the organs of the body," suggesting a specialized function within humanity rather than superiority.

### Medieval Philosophy

Medieval Jewish thinkers refined the concept:

- **Maimonides** emphasized that chosenness was intellectual and spiritual in nature, related to Israel's acceptance of true monotheistic beliefs
- **Judah Halevi** saw chosenness as an inherent spiritual quality of the Jewish people, a special receptivity to divine revelation
- **Nachmanides** connected chosenness to the land of Israel, suggesting a unique relationship between the people, the land, and divine providence

### Mystical Interpretations

Kabbalistic tradition offers distinctive views:

- The concept of Israel as God's "firstborn" is understood metaphysically, with Jewish souls deriving from a higher spiritual source
- The Zohar describes Israel as connected to the sefirah (divine attribute) of Tiferet, representing harmony and balance
- Some Kabbalistic texts describe the Jewish people as having a special role in the cosmic tikkun (repair)
- The Hasidic tradition emphasized that every person and nation has a unique purpose, with Israel's distinctiveness lying in its particular mission

## Modern Interpretations

### Orthodox Approach

Modern Orthodox thinkers typically maintain:

- The traditional concept of literal chosenness while emphasizing its ethical dimensions
- The ongoing obligation of Jews to serve as moral exemplars and teachers
- The view that chosenness involves greater responsibility rather than privilege

Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik wrote of the "covenant of fate and destiny" that binds Jews in a shared historical experience and mission.

### Conservative Perspective

Conservative Judaism generally holds:

- A modified understanding of chosenness that emphasizes ethical witness
- The view that the concept evolved from tribal beginnings toward universal moral purpose
- The continuing relevance of Jewish distinctiveness in service to humanity

Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote that chosenness means "being looked at by God" rather than looking down on others, emphasizing the ethical responsibilities it entails.

### Reform and Reconstructionist Views

More liberal movements have substantially reinterpreted the concept:

- **Reform Judaism** has historically de-emphasized literal chosenness, with the 1999 Pittsburgh Platform stating: "We are called by God to be partners with God in tikkun olam, repairing the world"
- **Reconstructionist Judaism**, founded by Mordecai Kaplan, rejected supernatural chosenness in favor of viewing Judaism as an evolving religious civilization with its own valuable ethical contributions
- Both movements emphasize Jewish distinctiveness and purpose without claims of inherent superiority or exclusive revelation

Rabbi Eugene Borowitz suggested understanding chosenness as a "myth" in the positive sense—a formative narrative that helps Jews understand their place in history and responsibility to humanity.

## Theological Challenges and Responses

### Tensions with Modern Values

The concept of chosenness raises several theological challenges in modern contexts:

- Potential conflict with egalitarian and universalist values
- Concerns about ethnocentrism or supremacist interpretations
- Questions about the relationship between particularism and universalism
- Discomfort with supernatural election in naturalistic worldviews

### Modern Responses

Contemporary Jewish thinkers have offered various responses:

- **Mission-Focused Reinterpretation**: Emphasizing chosenness as a call to service rather than status (Rabbi Jonathan Sacks)
- **Dialogical Understanding**: Viewing chosenness as one component of a dialogue among civilizations, each with unique contributions (Martin Buber)
- **Historical-Cultural Approach**: Seeing chosenness as a historically conditioned expression of Jewish uniqueness that can be reinterpreted for modern sensibilities
- **Covenantal Pluralism**: Affirming multiple paths to God while maintaining the specificity of the Jewish covenant (Rabbi Irving Greenberg)

## Contemporary Significance

### Theological Implications

The concept of chosenness continues to influence Jewish theology in several ways:

- As a framework for understanding Jewish historical survival and contribution
- As a source of meaning and purpose in Jewish religious life
- As a theological basis for Jewish distinctiveness in practice and belief
- As a concept requiring ongoing interpretation in light of contemporary values

### Interfaith Dimensions

In an era of interfaith dialogue, chosenness has been reexamined:

- Many modern Jewish thinkers emphasize that chosenness does not negate the validity of other religious paths
- Rabbi Jonathan Sacks proposed the concept of "the dignity of difference," suggesting that God enters covenantal relationships with different peoples in different ways
- Interfaith discussions often focus on how each tradition understands its unique role in the divine plan without negating others

### Identity and Practice

For contemporary Jews, chosenness relates to questions of:

- How to maintain Jewish distinctiveness while fully participating in modern society
- How to understand the relationship between Jewish identity and universal human values
- How to balance particularistic practices with universalistic ethical commitments
- How to interpret ancient theological concepts in light of contemporary pluralistic values

## Common Misunderstandings

### Clarifications

Several misunderstandings about Jewish chosenness persist:

- **Chosenness ≠ Superiority**: The concept does not claim inherent Jewish superiority but rather a specific religious role and responsibility
- **Not Racial or Genetic**: Jewish chosenness is covenantal and religious, not racial; converts fully participate in this chosen status
- **Not Exclusivist Salvation**: Traditional Judaism does not teach that only Jews can have a relationship with God or achieve salvation
- **Not a Claim to Privilege**: Classical sources emphasize the burdens rather than benefits of chosenness
