# Who Is a Jew?

![Jewish identity symbols](who_is_jew.jpg)

The question "Who is a Jew?" addresses the fundamental issue of Jewish identity and belonging. It encompasses legal definitions, historical developments, philosophical approaches, and contemporary challenges regarding membership in the Jewish people. This question has profound implications for individuals, communities, religious practice, and Jewish continuity.

## Traditional Definitions

### Halakhic Criteria

According to traditional Jewish law (halakhah), Jewish identity is determined by:

1. **Matrilineal Descent**: A person born to a Jewish mother is considered Jewish
   > "Your status follows your mother." (Mishnah Kiddushin 3:12)

2. **Conversion**: A non-Jew who undergoes a valid conversion process becomes Jewish
   > "The convert is like a newborn child." (Yevamot 22a)

These principles emerged from Talmudic discussions and became firmly established in rabbinic Judaism. The matrilineal principle appears in the Mishnah and was reinforced through subsequent rabbinic literature, though some scholars note that biblical precedents (such as Ezra) seemed to follow patrilineal descent.

### Conversion Requirements

Traditional conversion to Judaism involves:
- Study of Jewish beliefs and practices
- Acceptance of the commandments (kabbalat ol mitzvot)
- Circumcision for males (brit milah)
- Immersion in a ritual bath (mikvah)
- Approval by a rabbinic court (beit din)

The conversion process evolved from simple biblical references to the detailed procedures described in rabbinic literature, with increasing formalization over time.

## Historical Developments

### Biblical Period

In biblical texts, Jewish identity was framed primarily in terms of:
- Descent from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
- Membership in the tribes of Israel
- Participation in the covenant at Sinai
- Adherence to distinctive practices (e.g., Sabbath, dietary laws)

The Bible also recognizes the "ger" (stranger/sojourner) who could join the community.

### Second Temple Variations

During the Second Temple period (516 BCE-70 CE), different Jewish groups had varying approaches:
- Pharisees established foundations of rabbinic criteria
- Some groups emphasized stricter genetic lineage
- The Hasmonean period saw forced conversions of conquered peoples
- Distinctions developed between full converts and "God-fearers"

### Diaspora Experience

The dispersion of Jews throughout the world led to:
- Maintenance of endogamous marriage patterns
- Development of systematic conversion processes
- Emergence of distinct Jewish subcommunities
- Varying degrees of interaction with host societies

## Modern Challenges

### Denominational Differences

Modern Jewish movements disagree on "Who is a Jew":

**Orthodox Judaism**
- Strictly maintains traditional halakhic criteria
- Requires conversions conducted according to traditional law
- Does not recognize non-Orthodox conversions
- Applies matrilineal descent principle without exception

**Conservative Judaism**
- Generally upholds matrilineal descent principle
- Recognizes conversions performed under Conservative auspices
- Requires traditional elements but with some modernized approaches
- Has debated but not adopted patrilineal descent

**Reform Judaism**
- Since 1983, has officially recognized patrilineal descent if accompanied by Jewish upbringing
- Takes a more inclusive approach to conversion requirements
- Emphasizes self-identification and Jewish living
- Focuses on Jewish commitment rather than technical legal status

**Reconstructionist Judaism**
- Accepts both matrilineal and patrilineal descent
- Embraces inclusive conversion practices
- Emphasizes cultural and communal identification
- Considers Jewish identity primarily in sociological terms

### Israeli Civil Law

The State of Israel's "Law of Return" grants citizenship rights to:
- Anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent
- Converts to Judaism (with ongoing disputes over which conversions qualify)
- Spouses of Jews

This definition, created for immigration purposes, is broader than traditional halakhic definitions, leading to situations where some Israeli citizens are not considered Jewish under religious law administered by the Orthodox rabbinate in Israel.

### Interfaith Families

The high rate of intermarriage in diaspora communities has prompted:
- Debates over status of children from mixed marriages
- Outreach initiatives to interfaith families
- Varying approaches to non-Jewish spouses in Jewish communal life
- Questions about Jewish identity in multifaith households

## Special Cases

### Specific Communities

Several communities raise particular questions regarding Jewish identity:

**Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews)**
- Recognized as Jews by Israeli rabbinate in 1970s
- Required symbolic conversion rituals upon immigration to Israel
- Practice Judaism with some distinctive traditions
- Separated from mainstream Jewish communities for centuries

**Bene Israel (Indian Jews)**
- Ancient Jewish community from India
- Initially faced questions about their status in Israel
- Eventually recognized as fully Jewish
- Maintained distinctive customs while preserving core Jewish practices

**Bnei Anusim/Crypto-Jews**
- Descendants of Iberian Jews forced to convert to Christianity
- Some maintained Jewish practices in secret for centuries
- Various approaches to their reintegration into Jewish communities
- Questions about need for formal conversion

**Karaites**
- Follow the Hebrew Bible but reject rabbinic tradition
- Recognized as Jews but with disputed status regarding marriage in Israel
- Practice different forms of Judaism with their own interpretations
- Historical tensions with rabbinic communities

### Emerging Identity Questions

Contemporary Jewish communities address new questions:
- Status of children conceived through reproductive technologies
- Jewish identity in adoptive families
- Self-identified Jews without formal conversion
- Jews who practice other religions

## Philosophical Perspectives

### Essentialist Approaches

Some view Jewish identity as inherently defined by:
- Divine covenant and chosen status
- Unbroken chain of tradition and ancestry
- Distinct spiritual qualities
- Metaphysical bond (e.g., the concept of the "Jewish soul" or neshamah)

### Constructivist Views

Others see Jewish identity as socially constructed through:
- Communal affiliation and participation
- Cultural practices and identification
- Shared historical memory and consciousness
- Personal choice and commitment

### Jewish Identity Components

Scholars often analyze Jewish identity as consisting of multiple dimensions:
- **Religious**: Beliefs, practices, and ritual observance
- **Ethnic**: Cultural heritage, customs, and language
- **National**: Connection to Jewish peoplehood and Israel
- **Historical**: Shared memory and consciousness of Jewish history
- **Existential**: Personal sense of belonging and identification

## Contemporary Approaches

### Sociological Research

Studies of contemporary Jewish identity reveal:
- Increasing fluidity in self-identification
- Multiple and overlapping forms of Jewish expression
- Growing numbers who identify as "partially Jewish" or "Jewish and something else"

- Different pathways to Jewish engagement

### Inclusive Trends

- Welcoming attitudes toward those exploring Jewish identity
