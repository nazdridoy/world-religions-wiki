# Shulchan Aruch - The Set Table

![Shulchan Aruch printed page](shulchan_aruch_page.jpg)

*Shulchan Aruch* (שולחן ערוך, "Set Table") is the most authoritative codification of Jewish law written by Rabbi Yosef Karo (1488-1575) and published in Venice in 1565. This groundbreaking legal compendium systematically presents the practical halakhah (Jewish law) for everyday observance, organizing complex legal traditions into a clear, accessible format for Jews across diverse communities. Composed after the trauma of the Spanish Expulsion and the dispersion of Sephardic Jewry, the Shulchan Aruch aimed to standardize Jewish practice by providing definitive rulings primarily based on Sephardic traditions. Later supplemented by Rabbi Moshe Isserles' Ashkenazic glosses (Mappah), the combined work became the universally accepted legal reference for traditional Judaism. Its comprehensive scope, systematic organization, and definitive character have made it the foundation of Jewish religious practice for over four centuries, establishing it as the most influential Jewish legal text of the post-medieval era.
