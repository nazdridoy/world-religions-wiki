![Ancient scroll of Joshua](joshua_scroll.jpg)

The Former Prophets constitute the first section of Nevi'im (Prophets), the second major division of the Hebrew Bible. Comprising four books—Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings—these texts chronicle the history of the Israelite nation from the conquest of Canaan through the establishment of the monarchy, its division, and eventual destruction with the Babylonian exile. While primarily historical in nature, these works are classified as prophetic literature because they interpret historical events through a theological lens, demonstrating how Israel's fortunes were tied to its covenant relationship with God.
