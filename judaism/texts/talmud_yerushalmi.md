![Jerusalem Talmud manuscript page](yerushalmi_manuscript.jpg)

The Jerusalem Talmud (Talmud Yerushalmi), also known as the Palestinian Talmud, is one of the two compilations of Jewish oral law and commentary on the Mishnah, developed in the Land of Israel during the late 3rd to early 5th centuries CE. Though less comprehensive and less studied historically than its Babylonian counterpart, the Yerushalmi offers unique insights into early rabbinic thought, the realities of Jewish life under Roman rule, and preserves traditions and interpretations not found in the Babylonian Talmud.

## Overview and Significance

- **Primary Editors**: Traditionally attributed to Rabbi Yochanan and his disciples
- **Coverage**: Contains Gemara on 39 of the 63 Mishnaic tractates
