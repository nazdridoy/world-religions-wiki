![Medieval piyyut manuscript page](piyyut_manuscript.jpg)

Piyyutim (singular: piyyut, פִּיּוּט) are Jewish liturgical poems that have enriched Jewish prayer services and religious expression for nearly two millennia. These artistic compositions combine biblical language, rabbinic concepts, and poetic creativity to supplement the standard prayer liturgy, particularly on Sabbaths, festivals, and special occasions. Representing one of Judaism's most significant literary traditions, piyyutim reflect the theological concerns, historical experiences, and artistic sensibilities of Jewish communities across time and place.
