![Ancient midrash manuscript page](midrash_manuscript.jpg)

Midrash represents the vast corpus of rabbinic literature that creatively interprets, expands, and applies biblical texts through innovative hermeneutical methods, narrative elaboration, and ethical exploration. Spanning from early rabbinic compilations to medieval collections, midrashic literature bridges perceived gaps in Scripture, extracts multiple layers of meaning, and addresses contemporary concerns by engaging with the biblical text in a dynamic interpretive relationship. Both as a literary form and an interpretive process, midrash illuminates the vitality of Jewish textual engagement and continues to inspire religious thought, ethical reflection, and cultural expression.
