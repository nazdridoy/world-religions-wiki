The Mishnah (מִשְׁנָה, "repetition" or "study") is the first major written compilation of Jewish oral traditions, serving as the foundation of rabbinic Judaism. Compiled around 200 CE under the leadership of Rabbi Judah HaNasi (Judah the Prince), this systematic code of Jewish law represents the culmination of centuries of oral transmission and debate. Organized into six orders containing 63 tractates, the Mishnah became the core text upon which the Talmud was built and remains central to Jewish legal, religious, and intellectual life.
