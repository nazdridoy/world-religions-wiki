# Jewish Apocrypha - Between Canon and Tradition

![Ancient apocryphal manuscript](apocrypha_manuscript.jpg)

The Jewish Apocrypha comprises a diverse collection of texts that occupy a unique position at the margins of Jewish scriptural tradition—neither fully included in the Hebrew Bible's canonical boundaries nor entirely excluded from Jewish intellectual and religious history. Written primarily during the Second Temple period (539 BCE – 70 CE), these works span various genres, including historical narratives, wisdom literature, apocalyptic visions, and expanded biblical stories. While ultimately not accepted into the official Jewish canon, many of these texts were preserved in Christian traditions and continued to influence Jewish thought through complex patterns of reception and reinterpretation across the centuries.
