# PaRDeS - The Four Levels of Torah Interpretation

![Medieval manuscript illustrating PaRDeS](pardes_manuscript.jpg)

PaRDeS represents the classical Jewish framework of four interpretive dimensions through which sacred texts are understood and applied. This multilayered interpretive system—encompassing Peshat (literal meaning), Remez (allegorical hint), Drash (homiletical interpretation), and Sod (mystical understanding)—provides a comprehensive methodology for extracting meaning from Torah and other sacred texts. Developed throughout the rabbinic and medieval periods, PaRDeS acknowledges the complex nature of revelation and enables the text to speak to diverse human needs, intellectual capacities, and spiritual sensibilities across changing historical contexts.
