# Tosefta - Supplementary Tannaitic Teachings

![Ancient Tosefta manuscript](tosefta_manuscript.jpg)

The Tosefta (תוספתא, "addition" or "supplement") is a compilation of oral law from the late 2nd century CE that serves as a supplement to the earlier Mishnah. While similar in structure and content to the Mishnah, the Tosefta offers additional, alternative, or elaborative tannaitic traditions that were not included in Rabbi Judah HaNasi's authoritative compilation of the Mishnah.

## Historical Context and Development

### Origins and Compilation

- **Time Period**: Compiled around 220-230 CE, shortly after the Mishnah
- **Primary Editors**: Traditionally attributed to Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Oshaya

- **Purpose**: Preserves tannaitic teachings omitted from the Mishnah
- **Transitional Text**: Bridges the gap between Mishnah and later rabbinic works

### Manuscript History

- **Medieval Manuscripts**: First complete manuscripts date to the Middle Ages
- **Vienna Manuscript**: Important early text from the 12th century
- **Erfurt Manuscript**: Another significant medieval version

### Linguistic Features

- **Language**: Mishnaic Hebrew with some Aramaic elements
- **Stylistic Traits**: Generally more expansive and detailed than the Mishnah
- **Dialectical Variations**: Contains some regional Hebrew usages
- **Terminology**: Uses some unique technical terms not found in the Mishnah

  6. **Tohorot** (Purities): Ritual purity and impurity
