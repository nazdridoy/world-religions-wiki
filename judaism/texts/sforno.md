Ovadia (Obadiah) ben Jacob Sforno (c. 1475-1550) was an Italian rabbi, physician, philosopher, and biblical commentator whose work represents one of the most significant Renaissance-era Jewish contributions to biblical exegesis. His commentary combines traditional rabbinic perspectives with Renaissance humanist scholarship while maintaining an unwavering commitment to the simple meaning (peshat) of the biblical text.
