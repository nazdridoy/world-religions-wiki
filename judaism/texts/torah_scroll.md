The Sefer Torah (ספר תורה, "Book of Torah") is the handwritten parchment scroll containing the Five Books of Moses. As Judaism's most sacred physical object, it embodies the covenant between God and the Jewish people, and its creation, maintenance, and ritual use reflect the highest levels of religious reverence and attention to detail.

## Physical Characteristics and Production

### Materials and Construction

The Torah scroll is created using specific traditional materials:

- **Parchment (Klaf)**: Made from the skin of a kosher animal (usually cow, but sometimes deer, sheep, or goat)
- **Processing**: Skins cleaned, dehaired, stretched, split, and treated with lime and other chemicals
- **Writing Surface**: Interior (flesh) side of the skin used for writing
- **Assembly**: Individual sheets (yeriot) sewn together with sinew (giddin) from kosher animals
- **Mounting**: Attached to wooden rollers (atzei chayim, "trees of life") at each end
- **Size**: Typically 20-25 inches (50-60 cm) in height; length varies with script size (24-60 feet/7-18 meters)
- **Weight**: Approximately 15-25 pounds (7-11 kg) when complete

### Scribal Process

The creation of a Torah scroll involves meticulous craftsmanship:

- **Scribe (Sofer)**: Specially trained Torah scribe, traditionally male
- **Qualifications**: Religious observance, moral character, and technical expertise
- **Training**: 3-5 years apprenticeship to master the art
- **Preparation**: Ritual immersion (mikvah) and declaration of intent (lishmah)
- **Ink (Deyo)**: Black, durable ink traditionally made from gallnuts, gum arabic, copper sulfate, and tannic acid
- **Writing Implement**: Quill (kulmus) typically from a turkey or goose feather
- **Duration**: Approximately one year of full-time work to complete a scroll
- **Cost**: Modern Torah scroll typically costs $30,000-$100,000 depending on size and quality

### Textual Requirements

The Torah scroll must adhere to strict specifications:

- **Text**: Exactly 304,805 letters comprising the Five Books of Moses
- **Script**: Square Assyrian script (K'tav Ashuri) with specific calligraphic styles
- **Layout**: Precise format with standardized column width and spacing

  - Suspended letters (otiyot taluyot)
  - Inverted letters (otiyot hafuchot)
  - Dotted letters (otiyot nekudot)

### Ritual Validity

Strict standards maintain the scroll's ritual fitness:
