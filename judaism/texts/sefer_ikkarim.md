# Sefer ha-Ikkarim - Book of Principles

![Sefer ha-Ikkarim manuscript page](sefer_ikkarim_manuscript.jpg)

*Sefer ha-Ikkarim* (ספר העיקרים, "Book of Principles") is a foundational work of Jewish theology written by Rabbi Joseph Albo (c. 1380-1444) in the early 15th century. Completed around 1425, this systematic exposition presents a hierarchical framework of Jewish religious principles, distinguishing between fundamental dogmas, derived principles, and traditional beliefs. Composed in a period of intense religious disputation and social pressure on Spanish Jewish communities, Albo's work sought to clarify the essential requirements of Jewish faith while providing philosophical defenses against external criticism. The work remains one of the clearest systematic presentations of medieval Jewish theology, combining philosophical sophistication with an accessible style that made complex theological concepts understandable to a broader audience.

### Organization

2. **Second Treatise**: Detailed exploration of the first root principle (existence of God)
3. **Third Treatise**: Analysis of the second root principle (divine revelation)
4. **Fourth Treatise**: Exposition of the third root principle (reward and punishment)

### Albo's Hierarchy of Principles

The work presents a three-tiered theological framework:

#### Root Principles (Ikkarim)

These three fundamental principles form the essential foundation of authentic divine religion:

1. **Existence of God**: Belief in a supreme divine being who created and governs the universe
2. **Divine Revelation**: Acceptance that God communicates commandments to humanity
3. **Reward and Punishment**: Recognition that God rewards virtue and punishes transgression

#### Branch Principles (Shorashim)

These eight secondary principles derive necessarily from the root principles:

1. **God's Unity**: The oneness and indivisibility of God
2. **God's Incorporeality**: God's non-physical, non-bodily nature
3. **God's Timelessness**: God's existence beyond temporal limitations
4. **God's Perfection**: The absence of deficiency in God's nature
5. **Prophecy**: The reality of prophetic communication from God
6. **Prophetic Authenticity**: Moses' unique prophetic status
7. **Torah's Divine Origin**: The divine authorship of the Torah
8. **Torah's Immutability**: The unchangeable nature of the Torah's commandments

#### Derivative Beliefs (Anafim)

Additional traditional beliefs that, while important, are not essential dogmas:

- **Messianic Redemption**: Belief in future national restoration
