# Moreh Nevukhim - Guide for the Perplexed

![Guide for the Perplexed manuscript page](guide_perplexed_manuscript.jpg)

*Moreh Nevukhim* (מורה נבוכים), known in English as "Guide for the Perplexed," is a monumental philosophical work written by Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (Maimonides, 1138-1204), the preeminent Jewish thinker of the medieval period. Composed in Judeo-Arabic between 1190 and 1200, this revolutionary treatise attempts to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with Jewish theology, addressing those "perplexed" by apparent contradictions between reason and revelation. The work systematically explores the relationship between philosophical inquiry and religious tradition, covering topics ranging from divine attributes and prophecy to the reasons behind biblical commandments. Representing the pinnacle of medieval Jewish rationalism, the Guide has profoundly influenced Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought for centuries, while also generating significant controversy for its philosophical approach to religious questions.
