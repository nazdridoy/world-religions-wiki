### Holiness (Kedushah)

Central to Leviticus is the concept of holiness:

- **Divine Holiness**: God's absolute purity and separation from impurity
- **Call to Holiness**: "You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy" (19:2)
- **Graded Holiness**: Concentric circles of sanctity (most holy place → holy place → courtyard → camp → outside)
- **Temporal Holiness**: Sacred times set apart from ordinary time
- **Personal Holiness**: Ethical, ritual, and moral purity
- **Communal Holiness**: Israel as a holy nation (distinct from other peoples)
- **Holistic View**: Integration of ritual, moral, and ethical dimensions

### Sacrifice and Atonement

Leviticus develops a comprehensive sacrificial theology:

- **Expiation**: Removal of sin and impurity
- **Propitiation**: Appeasement of divine wrath
- **Substitution**: Animal life given in place of human life
- **Ransom**: Payment to redeem or recover what is forfeited by sin
- **Communion**: Establishment of proper relationship with God
- **Thanksgiving**: Expression of gratitude to God
- **Gift**: Presentation of offering to honor God
- **Ritual Efficacy**: Properly performed rites accomplish real spiritual effects

### Purity and Impurity

The book presents a detailed system of ritual purity:

- **Not Primarily Hygienic**: Although some health benefits may result
