![Malbim portrait](malbim_portrait.jpg)

The Malbim, an acronym for Meir Leibush ben Yechiel Michel (1809-1879), is one of the most distinctive and analytically rigorous Torah commentaries of the modern era. Written by Rabbi Meir Leibush Wisser, this commentary revolutionized biblical exegesis through its insistence on precise linguistic analysis, logical structure, and the absolute unity of the Written and Oral Torah traditions. The Malbim stands as both a defense of traditional Judaism against the Reform movement and a pioneering work of modern Jewish scholarship.
