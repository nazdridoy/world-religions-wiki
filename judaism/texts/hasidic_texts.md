![Hasidic manuscript page](hasidic_manuscript.jpg)

Hasidic literature constitutes one of the most significant and innovative bodies of Jewish religious writing from the mid-18th century to the present day. Emerging from the spiritual movement founded by Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer (the Baal Shem Tov, c. 1700-1760), these texts present a radical reimagining of Jewish religious life that emphasizes joy, emotional connection to God, the sanctification of everyday experience, and the accessibility of spiritual elevation to all Jews regardless of scholarly achievement. Combining mystical teachings, ethical guidance, storytelling, and innovative scriptural interpretation, Hasidic literature has profoundly influenced modern Jewish spirituality beyond the boundaries of the Hasidic movement itself.
