![Arba'ah Turim manuscript page](arbaah_turim_manuscript.jpg)

The Arba'ah Turim (Hebrew: אַרְבָּעָה טוּרִים), often called simply "the Tur," is a landmark code of Jewish law composed by Rabbi Jacob ben Asher (c. 1270-1340). Written in the early 14th century, this comprehensive legal compendium revolutionized the organization of Jewish law and established a framework that continues to influence halakhic literature to the present day. The work's name, meaning "Four Rows" or "Four Pillars," refers to its division into four distinct sections, each addressing a different domain of Jewish practice.
