Critical scholarship of Jewish texts applies academic methodologies from history, philology, archaeology, literary criticism, and other disciplines to analyze Jewish sacred and traditional writings. This approach, developed primarily since the 19th century, examines texts within their historical and cultural contexts, often yielding different conclusions from traditional religious interpretations while providing valuable insights into the development and meaning of Jewish textual traditions.
