# Or Adonai - Light of the Lord

![Or Adonai manuscript page](or_adonai_manuscript.jpg)

*Or Adonai* (אור ה', "Light of the Lord") is a seminal philosophical work written by Rabbi Hasdai Crescas (c. 1340-1410/11), one of the most original and penetrating Jewish thinkers of the late medieval period. Completed around 1410, this groundbreaking treatise represents a profound critique of Aristotelian philosophy, which had dominated Jewish thought through Maimonides and his followers. Crescas challenged fundamental Aristotelian premises while developing an alternative philosophical framework more harmonious with traditional Jewish theology. His work stands as a critical turning point in Jewish intellectual history, reasserting the primacy of revelation over reason while employing sophisticated philosophical argumentation to defend traditional beliefs concerning God, creation, free will, and religious practice.
