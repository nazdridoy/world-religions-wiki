"Emunot ve-Deot" (אמונות ודעות, "Beliefs and Opinions"), originally written in Arabic as "Kitāb al-Amānāt wal-Iʿtiqādāt," is a groundbreaking philosophical work composed by Rabbi Saadia ben Joseph (882-942 CE), known as Saadia Gaon. Completed around 933 CE, this treatise represents the first systematic attempt to harmonize Jewish religious belief with rational philosophy. Through careful argumentation, Saadia established a framework for understanding traditional Jewish faith in light of reason, addressing fundamental questions about God, creation, revelation, human nature, ethics, and eschatology. The work profoundly influenced subsequent Jewish philosophical thought and established rational inquiry as a legitimate approach within Jewish tradition.
