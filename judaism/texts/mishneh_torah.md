![Mishneh Torah manuscript page](mishneh_torah_manuscript.jpg)

*Mishneh Torah* (משנה תורה, "Repetition of the Torah"), also known as *Yad ha-Ḥazakah* (יד החזקה, "Strong Hand"), is a monumental legal code composed by Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (Maimonides, 1138-1204) between 1170 and 1180. This revolutionary work represents the first comprehensive systematization of all Jewish law, organizing the vast corpus of Talmudic and post-Talmudic halakhah into a logically structured, accessible format. Written in clear Mishnaic Hebrew without citation of sources, the Mishneh Torah covers the entirety of Jewish law—both practical and theoretical, applicable and non-applicable commandments—providing a complete legal framework for Jewish life. Its innovative organization, scope, and clarity established a new paradigm for Jewish legal literature, making it one of the most influential works in Jewish history and a foundational text that continues to shape Jewish practice and thought to this day.
