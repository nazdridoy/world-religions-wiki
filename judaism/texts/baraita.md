Baraita (בָּרַיְתָא, "external" or "outside"; plural: baraitot) refers to tannaitic teachings from the Mishnaic period (1st-2nd centuries CE) that were not incorporated into the Mishnah compiled by Rabbi Judah HaNasi. These "external" teachings preserve alternative traditions, expansions, and perspectives from the tannaitic era and provide crucial context for understanding the development of early rabbinic Judaism.
