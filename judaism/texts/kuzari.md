# Kuzari - The Book of Argument and Proof

![Kuzari manuscript page](kuzari_manuscript.jpg)

*Sefer ha-Kuzari* (ספר הכוזרי, "The Book of the Khazar") is a philosophical and apologetic work written by Rabbi Judah Halevi (c. 1075-1141) around 1140 CE. Composed in Arabic under the title "Kitāb al-Ḥujja wal-Dalīl fī Nuṣr al-Dīn al-Dhalīl" (The Book of Argument and Proof in Defense of the Despised Faith), this innovative treatise presents Judaism's core ideas through a fictional dialogue between a Khazar king and representatives of different belief systems. Structured as a historical narrative based on the conversion of the Khazar kingdom to Judaism in the 8th century, the work offers a profound defense of Judaism as a revealed religion grounded in historical experience rather than philosophical speculation. Representing a decisive break with Aristotelian rationalism, the Kuzari elevates the direct religious experience of the Jewish people over abstract philosophical arguments, establishing a unique approach to Jewish thought that continues to influence religious discourse.
