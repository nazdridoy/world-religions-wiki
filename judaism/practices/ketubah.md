# Ketubah: The Jewish Marriage Contract

![Ornate decorated ketubah](ketubah_art.jpg)

The ketubah is a fundamental legal document in Jewish marriage that outlines the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of the husband toward his wife. Dating back approximately 2,500 years, the ketubah represents one of Judaism's earliest expressions of women's financial and legal protection. Beyond its legal function, the ketubah has evolved into an important artistic and ritual object, often elaborately decorated and prominently displayed in Jewish homes as both a practical contract and a symbol of the sacred covenant of marriage.
