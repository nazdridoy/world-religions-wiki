The Chevra Kadisha (Hebrew: חֶבְרָה קַדִישָׁא, "holy society") is one of Judaism's most profound and enduring communal institutions, dedicated to ensuring proper and respectful care for the deceased. This volunteer organization performs what Jewish tradition considers the ultimate act of loving-kindness (chesed shel emet), as it is a service that cannot be reciprocated by the recipient.
