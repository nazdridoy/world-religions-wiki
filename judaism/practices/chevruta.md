Chevruta (Hebrew: חַבְרוּתָא, also spelled chavrusa or havruta) represents one of Judaism's most distinctive educational methodologies—a dynamic approach to Torah study in which two learners engage collaboratively with sacred texts through analysis, question-asking, and debate. More than merely a learning technique, chevruta embodies core Jewish values of intellectual partnership, respectful disagreement, and the belief that truth emerges through mutual investigation and dialogue.
