Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles or Festival of Booths, is one of Judaism's three major pilgrimage festivals and comes five days after Yom Kippur. This seven-day autumn celebration combines historical commemoration of the Israelites' wilderness journey with agricultural thanksgiving for the fall harvest. Distinguished by its unique practices of dwelling in temporary structures (sukkot) and the ritual use of the Four Species, this festival is traditionally known as "Z'man Simchateinu" — "The Time of Our Rejoicing" — and is characterized by its emphasis on joy, hospitality, and connection to nature.
