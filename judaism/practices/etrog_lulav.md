# Etrog and Lulav: The Four Species

![The Four Species assembled for blessing](four_species.jpg)

The Arba'at HaMinim (Four Species) — comprising the etrog (citron), lulav (palm frond), hadassim (myrtle branches), and aravot (willow branches) — constitute one of Judaism's most distinctive ritual objects, used specifically during the festival of Sukkot. This ancient practice, directly commanded in the Torah, brings together four different plants that are joined, held, and waved in a prescribed manner as a central mitzvah of the autumn harvest festival. Combining botanical specificity, detailed ritual requirements, and rich symbolic interpretations, the Four Species represent a multisensory religious practice connecting Jews to nature, history, and divine commandment.

## Biblical and Historical Foundations

### Scriptural Source

- **Primary Biblical Command**: "On the first day you shall take the fruit of splendid trees, branches of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days" (Leviticus 23:40)
- **Traditional Identification**: Rabbinic interpretation established specific identity of each species
- **Archaeological Evidence**: Depictions on ancient coins and synagogue mosaics
- **Second Temple Practice**: Elaborate seven-day rituals in Jerusalem
- **Post-Temple Adaptation**: Transformation from Temple to synagogue/home ritual

### Historical Development
