![Person visiting patient in hospital](bikur_cholim_visit.jpg)

Bikur cholim (visiting the sick) represents one of Judaism's most fundamental expressions of compassion and communal responsibility. This mitzvah (commandment) encompasses a comprehensive system of care that extends beyond mere visitation to include physical assistance, emotional support, spiritual comfort, and practical aid. Throughout Jewish history, this practice has evolved from an individual religious obligation into organized communal structures while maintaining its core elements: recognizing human dignity during vulnerability, providing holistic support, and embodying the divine attribute of healing presence.
