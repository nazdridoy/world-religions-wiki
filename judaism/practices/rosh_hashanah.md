Rosh Hashanah, literally "Head of the Year," marks the beginning of the Jewish calendar year and inaugurates the High Holy Days period. Unlike secular new year celebrations focused on revelry, this solemn yet hopeful holiday initiates a ten-day period of introspection, repentance, and renewal culminating in Yom Kippur. As one of Judaism's most sacred observances, Rosh Hashanah interweaves themes of divine judgment, human accountability, and the renewal of the relationship between God and humanity.
