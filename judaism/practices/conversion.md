# Conversion to Judaism (Giyur)

![Conversion ceremony with beit din and mikvah](jewish_conversion.jpg)

Conversion to Judaism, known in Hebrew as *giyur* (גִיּוּר), represents a profound spiritual journey through which individuals born outside the Jewish faith can fully enter the Jewish covenant and people. Unlike some religious traditions that actively seek converts, Judaism has historically maintained a complex approach to conversion—neither discouraging sincere candidates nor actively proselytizing. The process of becoming Jewish involves not just theological affirmation but entrance into a people, culture, and historical legacy through study, ritual transformation, and community integration.
