# Daily Prayer in Judaism: Tefillah

![Morning prayer service with tallit and tefillin](daily_prayer.jpg)

Tefillah, the practice of Jewish prayer, forms one of the central pillars of Jewish religious life. As a regular, structured conversation with the divine, prayer in Judaism creates a rhythmic pattern that sanctifies daily existence, connects individuals to community, and maintains the covenant relationship between God and the Jewish people. Unlike spontaneous personal prayer (though this also exists in Judaism), the established prayer tradition follows carefully developed liturgical forms that have evolved over millennia yet remain remarkably consistent in their core elements across diverse Jewish communities worldwide.
