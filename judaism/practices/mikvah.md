The mikvah, a ritual immersion pool containing natural water, represents one of Judaism's most ancient and enduring ritual institutions. For thousands of years, this distinctive ritual bath has served as an essential component of Jewish religious life, providing physical purification with profound spiritual significance. From its biblical origins through its contemporary renaissance, the mikvah embodies Judaism's understanding of spiritual renewal through water, the boundary between states of ritual purity and impurity, and the powerful symbolism of rebirth and transformation.
