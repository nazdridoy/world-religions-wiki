Kriat HaTorah (קריאת התורה), the public reading of the Torah scroll, stands as one of Judaism's most ancient and enduring liturgical practices. This ceremonial reading places the physical encounter with sacred text at the center of Jewish worship, creating a powerful connection between contemporary worshippers and the revelation at Sinai. Through its carefully orchestrated removal, procession, chanting, and return, Torah reading embodies core theological concepts of revelation, community responsibility, textual transmission, and cyclical renewal.
