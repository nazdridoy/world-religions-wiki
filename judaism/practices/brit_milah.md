![Brit milah ceremony](brit_milah_ceremony.jpg)

Brit milah ("covenant of circumcision"), commonly referred to as a bris, is one of Judaism's most ancient and enduring practices, marking the physical covenant between God and the Jewish people. Performed on the eighth day after a male child's birth, this ceremony integrates the newborn into the Jewish community while establishing a tangible link to thousands of years of Jewish tradition and to the covenant first established with Abraham.

## Historical Development

### Biblical Origins

- **Covenant with Abraham**: Established in Genesis 17:10-14 as an "everlasting covenant"
- **Eighth Day Timing**: Specifically mandated in Leviticus 12:3
- **First Performance**: Abraham circumcising Isaac (Genesis 21:4)
- **Desert Practice**: Temporarily suspended during wilderness years
- **Renewal under Joshua**: Mass circumcision upon entering the Land of Israel (Joshua 5:2-9)

### Historical Continuity

- **Maintained Through Exile**: Practiced throughout Babylonian captivity
- **Greek Period Challenges**: Prohibition under Antiochus, leading to Maccabean revolt
- **Roman Period Resistance**: Defense against Hadrianic prohibitions
