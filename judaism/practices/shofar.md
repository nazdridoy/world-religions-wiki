# Shofar: The Ram's Horn

![Shofar being sounded during Rosh Hashanah service](shofar_blowing.jpg)

The shofar, an ancient musical instrument made from a ram's horn, stands as one of Judaism's most distinctive ritual objects and powerful symbols. With origins reaching back to biblical times, the shofar's stirring blast serves as a sacred alarm clock, awakening Jews to spiritual renewal during the High Holy Days and marking significant moments in Jewish history and ritual life. Beyond its ceremonial role, the shofar embodies rich layers of theological meaningâ€”from echoing the ram's horn at the binding of Isaac to prefiguring the messianic era's great trumpet blast.
