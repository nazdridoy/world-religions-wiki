# Minyan: The Jewish Prayer Quorum

A minyan, the prayer quorum of ten Jewish adults required for communal worship in Judaism, represents far more than a simple numerical threshold. This institution embodies core Jewish values of community interdependence, public prayer, and collective religious responsibility. The minyan requirement has shaped Jewish communal life for nearly two millennia, influencing synagogue architecture, community settlement patterns, and daily scheduling priorities. Through this practice, Judaism emphasizes that certain sacred activities require a critical mass of participants, reinforcing the essentially communal nature of Jewish religious expression.
