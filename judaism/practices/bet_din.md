![Jewish religious court in session](bet_din_session.jpg)

The Bet Din (plural: Batei Din), literally "house of judgment," represents Judaism's traditional legal framework for adjudicating disputes, rendering religious decisions, and overseeing conversion and personal status matters. Functioning as a religious court system, the Bet Din has evolved from biblical origins through rabbinic development to contemporary applications across diverse Jewish communities. While lacking civil authority in most modern contexts, these courts continue to play a vital role in maintaining Jewish religious self-governance, interpreting Jewish law, and preserving traditional dispute resolution mechanisms.
