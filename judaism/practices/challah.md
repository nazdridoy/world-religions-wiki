Challah (חלה) stands as one of Judaism's most recognizable and beloved food traditions, a distinctive braided bread that adorns Sabbath and holiday tables across Jewish communities worldwide. More than simply a culinary item, challah embodies layers of religious symbolism, historical meaning, and communal connection. From its origins in ancient Temple offerings to its modern expressions in diverse Jewish kitchens, challah represents the fusion of spiritual practice with everyday sustenance, transforming the act of breaking bread into a sacred ritual.
