Tikkun Olam, Hebrew for "repairing the world," has emerged as one of Judaism's most compelling and influential ethical concepts. Originally a mystical concept referring to restoring cosmic harmony, it has evolved to become a powerful framework for Jewish social responsibility, activism, and justice work. Tikkun Olam represents Judaism's commitment to partnering with God to perfect an imperfect world, addressing both spiritual and material manifestations of brokenness in society.
