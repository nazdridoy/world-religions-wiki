# Jewish Naming Ceremonies

![Baby naming ceremony](baby_naming_ceremony.jpg)

Naming ceremonies in Judaism mark a child's formal entry into the covenant community and establish their Jewish identity. These rituals vary by gender, community tradition, and denominational affiliation, but all share the common purpose of publicly declaring a Jewish name that will follow the individual throughout lifecycle events. From the traditional Brit Milah (circumcision) for boys to various forms of welcoming ceremonies for girls, these practices reflect both ancient traditions and evolving contemporary expressions of Jewish identity and belonging.
