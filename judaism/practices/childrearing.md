Jewish approaches to childrearing reflect the tradition's emphasis on transmitting values, practices, and identity across generations. Drawing on biblical precedents, rabbinic wisdom, cultural patterns, and evolving understanding of child development, Jewish parenting combines religious guidance with practical concern for children's well-being. The goal is raising children who embody Jewish values, maintain tradition, contribute positively to society, and develop as individuals within a supportive communal framework.
