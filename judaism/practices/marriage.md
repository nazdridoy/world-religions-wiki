Marriage in Judaism, traditionally known as *kiddushin* (sanctification) or *nisu'in* (elevation), stands as one of the most significant religious and cultural institutions in Jewish life. Considered both a contractual agreement and a sacred covenant, Jewish marriage combines legal, spiritual, and communal elements into a comprehensive framework for establishing a Jewish household. Throughout history, Jewish marriage customs have evolved while maintaining core elements that connect contemporary practices to ancient traditions.
