Chanukah (also spelled Hanukkah or Ḥanukkah) is the eight-day Jewish festival commemorating the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem following the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire. Often called the Festival of Lights, it celebrates the miracle of a small quantity of oil that lasted for eight days when the Temple was rededicated. Although considered a minor holiday in terms of religious significance, Chanukah has become one of the most widely celebrated Jewish festivals, particularly in Western countries.
