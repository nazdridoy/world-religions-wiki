# Chanukiah: The Chanukah Menorah

![Traditional Chanukah menorah with candles](chanukiah_lit.jpg)

The Chanukiah (also spelled Hanukkiah), commonly known as the Chanukah menorah, is the distinctive nine-branched candelabrum used during the Jewish festival of Chanukah. Unlike the seven-branched menorah that stood in the ancient Temple, the Chanukiah features eight branches representing the eight days of the Chanukah miracle, plus a ninth branch for the shamash (helper) candle used to light the others. As the central ritual object of Chanukah observance, the Chanukiah serves as both a religious article and a powerful symbol of Jewish identity, religious freedom, and cultural resilience.
