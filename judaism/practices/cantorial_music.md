# Cantorial Music in Judaism

![Cantor with Torah scroll](cantor_singing.jpg)

Cantorial music, known in Hebrew as *chazzanut*, represents the sophisticated and emotionally expressive musical tradition of Jewish liturgical prayer. For centuries, cantors (chazzanim) have served as the musical interpreters of Jewish prayer, using their voices to convey the deepest spiritual meanings of sacred texts and to elevate the communal worship experience. This tradition combines ancient modes, regional influences, and artistic innovation to create a distinctive musical heritage that continues to evolve in contemporary Jewish life.
