![Medical professionals treating a patient](medical_treatment.jpg)

Pikuach Nefesh (פיקוח נפש), "saving a life," represents one of Judaism's most fundamental and far-reaching ethical principles. This concept establishes the preservation of human life as a supreme value that supersedes nearly all other religious obligations. The principle reflects Judaism's profound reverence for life and establishes a framework for navigating conflicts between religious observance and life-threatening situations.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Theological Basis

- **Scriptural Foundations**: 
  - Leviticus 18:5: "You shall keep My statutes and My ordinances, which a person shall do and live by them" - interpreted to mean "live by them, not die by them"
  - Deuteronomy 4:9: "Take utmost care and watch yourselves scrupulously" - understood as a directive to protect life
  - Deuteronomy 22:2: Command to return lost property interpreted broadly to include saving endangered lives

- **Rabbinic Formulation**:
  - Talmudic discussions in Yoma 84b-85b establishing the principle
  - "Nothing stands before saving a life except for three prohibitions" (idolatry, sexual immorality, and murder)
  - Sanhedrin 74a establishing when one must give up one's life rather than transgress

- **Development Through Responsa**:
  - Extensive literature addressing specific life-threatening scenarios 
  - Evolving applications across historical periods
  - Codification in Maimonides' Mishneh Torah and the Shulchan Aruch

### Core Principles

- **Value of Human Life**: Each human life is of infinite worth
- **Duty to Act**: Obligation to intervene when life is threatened
- **Certainty vs. Doubt**: Even possible danger to life triggers the principle
