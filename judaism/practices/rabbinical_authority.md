![Traditional rabbi teaching students](rabbi_teaching.jpg)

Rabbinical authority represents a foundational organizing principle within Judaism, establishing frameworks for religious interpretation, communal leadership, and spiritual guidance. The rabbi (literally "my teacher") functions as the primary religious authority within Jewish communities, serving as text interpreter, legal decisor, communal leader, spiritual guide, and tradition transmitter. This system of authority has evolved significantly throughout Jewish history, adapting to changing political, social, and cultural circumstances while maintaining core continuities in function and legitimation.
