Jewish environmental ethics represents the application of traditional Jewish values, teachings, and practices to contemporary ecological challenges. Drawing on biblical passages, rabbinic interpretation, halakhic principles, and cultural wisdom, these ethics offer a framework for understanding humanity's relationship with nature and our responsibilities toward the created world.
