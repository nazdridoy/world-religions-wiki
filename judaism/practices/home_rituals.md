# Jewish Home Rituals

![Traditional Jewish home altar](home_altar.jpg)

Jewish home rituals transform the domestic sphere into sacred space, bringing religious practice into the fabric of everyday life. Beyond the synagogue, the Jewish home (bayit) serves as a mikdash me'at (small sanctuary), where tradition is enacted, transmitted, and experienced through domestic practices that sanctify time, space, objects, and relationships. These rituals connect family members to each other, to broader community, and to the chain of Jewish generations.
