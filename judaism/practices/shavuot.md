Shavuot, the Festival of Weeks, stands as one of Judaism's three biblical pilgrimage festivals (alongside Passover and Sukkot). Occurring seven weeks after Passover, Shavuot commemorates the revelation of the Torah at Mount Sinai and celebrates the first fruits of the harvest in the Land of Israel. This dual agricultural and historical significance has shaped the holiday's distinctive practices and spiritual meaning throughout Jewish history.
