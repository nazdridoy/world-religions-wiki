# Sephardic Customs and Traditions

![Traditional Sephardic synagogue interior](sephardic_synagogue.jpg)

Sephardic customs and traditions represent distinctive expressions of Judaism that developed among Jewish communities from the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) and their subsequent diaspora following the expulsions of 1492 and 1497. These traditions evolved through centuries of coexistence with Muslim and Christian civilizations in Mediterranean, North African, and Middle Eastern environments. Characterized by unique liturgical traditions, legal approaches, linguistic heritage, artistic expressions, and cultural practices, Sephardic Judaism encompasses both shared foundational elements with all Jewish traditions and distinctive regional variations that reflect local cultural adaptations.
