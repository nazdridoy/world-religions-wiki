# Tzitzit: The Ritual Fringes

![Tzitzit fringes on a tallit katan](tzitzit_fringes.jpg)

Tzitzit (ציצית), the ritual fringes attached to four-cornered garments, represent one of Judaism's most distinctive and scripturally explicit religious practices. Unlike many Jewish customs that developed through rabbinic interpretation, tzitzit emerge directly from a biblical commandment, instructing the Israelites to attach fringes to their garments as a visual reminder of God's commandments. Over millennia, this practice has evolved from an everyday ancient garment feature to a specialized ritual object that connects contemporary Jews with their ancestral traditions while serving as a constant reminder of religious obligation and identity.

## Fundamental Concepts
