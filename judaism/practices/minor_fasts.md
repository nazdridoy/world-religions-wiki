While Yom Kippur and Tisha B'Av stand as Judaism's major fast days, the tradition includes several additional minor fasts throughout the Jewish calendar. These minor fasts commemorate specific historical tragedies, provide opportunities for communal reflection, and serve as spiritual correctives. Unlike the major 25-hour fasts, these typically last from dawn until nightfall and feature somewhat less stringent observances, though they remain significant elements of the Jewish liturgical year.
