Shechita is the Jewish ritual method of slaughtering permitted animals and poultry to render the meat kosher for consumption. This carefully prescribed process reflects Judaism's profound concern with minimizing animal suffering, maintaining ritual purity, and creating a consciousness around the taking of animal life for food. Every aspect of shechita is governed by detailed halakhic requirements that have developed over millennia.

## Foundations and Principles

### Biblical Origins

- **Torah Source**: Deuteronomy 12:21 - "You may slaughter any of the cattle or sheep that the Lord gives you, as I have instructed you"
