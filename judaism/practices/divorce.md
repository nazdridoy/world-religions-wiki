# Get: Jewish Religious Divorce

![Jewish divorce ceremony](jewish_divorce_ceremony.jpg)

The Jewish divorce process (Get) represents an important religious mechanism for the formal dissolution of marriage within Jewish law. Unlike civil divorce, which concerns itself with the legal separation of assets and responsibilities, the Get addresses the spiritual and religious bonds established during the Jewish wedding ceremony (kiddushin), allowing both parties to remarry within the framework of Jewish law.

## Historical Development
