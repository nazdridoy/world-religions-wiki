# Kippah: The Jewish Head Covering

![Various styles of kippot (plural of kippah)](kippah_styles.jpg)

The kippah (כִּפָּה), also known as yarmulke in Yiddish, is one of Judaism's most recognizable religious symbols—a small head covering worn primarily by Jewish men as an expression of reverence for God and identification with the Jewish community. This simple garment carries complex layers of religious, cultural, and social significance, serving as both a personal religious expression and a public symbol of Jewish identity. Though modest in size and appearance, the kippah embodies profound theological concepts and has evolved over centuries to encompass diverse styles and meanings across Jewish communities worldwide.
