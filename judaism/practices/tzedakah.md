# Tzedakah: Charity and Justice in Judaism

![Tzedakah box with Hebrew lettering](tzedakah_box.jpg)

Tzedakah, derived from the Hebrew root meaning "righteousness" or "justice," represents the Jewish approach to charitable giving and social welfare. Unlike voluntary philanthropy in some traditions, tzedakah in Judaism constitutes a religious obligation and a system of social justice. Beyond mere financial donation, it encompasses a comprehensive approach to creating a more equitable society through both individual action and communal structures.
