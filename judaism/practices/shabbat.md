# Shabbat: The Jewish Sabbath

Shabbat (שַׁבָּת), the Jewish Sabbath, stands as Judaism's most fundamental ritual institution—a weekly sacred time beginning at sunset Friday and concluding after nightfall Saturday. Far beyond merely a day of rest, Shabbat represents the cornerstone of Jewish religious experience, a complete reordering of time and daily life, and a weekly taste of redemption. This distinctive practice combines cessation from creative labor, enhanced prayer and study, festive meals, community gathering, and spiritual reflection. Through the deliberate separation of sacred from mundane time, Shabbat creates a comprehensive spiritual, psychological, and social pause that has sustained Jewish identity and religious vitality for millennia. As a living embodiment of both creation and covenant narratives, Shabbat continues to provide contemporary practitioners with a deeply counter-cultural rhythm of meaning, rest, and joy in an increasingly frenetic world.
