# Tefillin: Sacred Bonds of Jewish Prayer

![Man wearing tefillin during morning prayer](tefillin_prayer.jpg)

Tefillin (תְּפִלִּין), also known as phylacteries, represent one of Judaism's most ancient and tangible ritual objects—small black leather boxes containing sacred texts that are bound to the arm and head during weekday morning prayers. These distinctive prayer implements serve as a physical embodiment of key biblical commandments, establishing a direct sensory connection between the worshiper, sacred scripture, and divine presence. Through this practice of literally binding God's words to the body, tefillin create a profound integration of physical action, textual engagement, and spiritual intention that has remained central to Jewish prayer practice for over two millennia.
