![Students engaged in Mussar study](mussar_study.jpg)

Mussar is a Jewish spiritual practice focused on personal ethical development and character refinement. Emerging formally in 19th century Lithuania but drawing on earlier traditions, Mussar provides systematic methods for identifying and improving one's moral traits (middot).
