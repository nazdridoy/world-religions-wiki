# Kosher Animals: Classification of Permitted Species

![Kosher animal identification chart](kosher_animals_chart.jpg)

The classification of animals as kosher (fit for consumption) or non-kosher (prohibited) represents one of Judaism's most distinctive and enduring religious practices. This comprehensive system of dietary boundaries extends beyond simple taboos to establish a framework through which observant Jews engage with the natural world, express religious identity, and sanctify the mundane act of eating through divine guidance. Rooted in biblical text yet elaborated through millennia of rabbinic interpretation, these classifications remain central to Jewish religious practice across diverse communities.

## Biblical Foundations

### Land Animals (Behemot)

- **Explicit Torah Criteria** (Leviticus 11:3, Deuteronomy 14:6):
  - Split hooves (completely divided)
  - Ruminant (chews cud)
- **Both Required**: Must possess both characteristics to be permitted
- **Explicitly Permitted Examples**: Cattle, sheep, goats, deer
- **Explicitly Forbidden Examples**:
  - Camel: Chews cud but no split hooves
  - Pig: Split hooves but doesn't chew cud
  - Rabbit: Chews cud but no split hooves
  - Hyrax: Chews cud but no split hooves
- **Torah's Emphasis**: Limited specified species but clear categories

### Water Creatures (Dagim)

- **Explicit Torah Criteria** (Leviticus 11:9-12, Deuteronomy 14:9-10):
  - Fins
  - Scales
- **Both Required**: Must have both features to be permitted
- **General Application**: All fish with both features are kosher
- **Explicitly Forbidden Categories**: 
  - Shellfish (no fins or scales)
  - Eels (no scales)
  - Sharks (scales not meeting halachic definition)
  - Marine mammals (not fish)
- **No Named Species**: Torah lists categories rather than specific fish

### Birds (Ofot)

- **Different Approach**: No explicit criteria given
- **Forbidden Species Listed**: Torah enumerates 24 non-kosher birds
- **Traditional Understanding**: Birds of prey and scavengers prohibited
- **Permitted Examples**: Domesticated fowl (chicken, turkey, duck)
- **Transmission Method**: Reliance on tradition rather than physical characteristics
- **Identification Challenges**: Scientific naming versus biblical terminology

### Insects and Small Creatures (Sheratzim)

- **General Prohibition**: Most "swarming creatures" forbidden
- **Limited Exception**: Certain types of locusts permitted
- **Four Permitted Species**: Specific locust varieties with tradition of consumption
- **Current Practice**: Most communities avoid all insects
- **Yemenite Tradition**: Maintained identification of permitted locusts
- **Modern Challenge**: Microscopic insect detection in produce

## Rabbinic Elaboration

### Talmudic Development

- **Signs of Kosher Animals**: Physical indications beyond biblical criteria
  - Lack of protruding teeth
  - Structure of hoof
- **Bird Classification System**: Physical signs developed
  - Extra toe
  - Crop structure
  - Gizzard that can be peeled
- **Traditional Lists**: Compilation of permitted species
- **Anatomical Details**: Further specification of scales and fins
- **Eggs**: Derived from identity of parent bird
- **Wild vs. Domesticated**: Different applications of rules

### Medieval Codification

- **Rashi's Commentary**: Clarifications of biblical categories
- **Maimonides' System**: Comprehensive classification in Mishneh Torah
- **Shulchan Aruch**: Practical guidance for communities
- **Regional Variations**: Different accepted species lists
- **Scientific Integration**: Early attempts to align with zoology
- **Visual Guides**: Development of illustrated manuals
- **Responsa Literature**: Addressing new species questions

### Contemporary Application

- **Scientific Classification**: Modern zoological understanding
- **Species Identification**: Resolving taxonomic questions
- **New World Species**: Application of principles to American animals
- **Australian Fauna**: Questions regarding unique species
- **Zoo Animals**: Classification of newly discovered creatures
- **Genetic Modification**: Questions regarding altered organisms
