Far more than simply a text, the Torah scroll embodies the continued revelation and covenant between God and the Jewish people, serving as the central focus of synagogue worship and communal identity. The reverence, precision, and ritual surrounding its creation, use, and maintenance reflect its status as the tangible representation of divine wisdom and instruction.
