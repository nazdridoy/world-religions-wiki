![Person holding finger to lips in silence gesture](lashon_hara.jpg)

Lashon Hara (לשון הרע), literally "evil tongue" or "evil speech," encompasses one of Judaism's most sophisticated and extensive ethical frameworks governing human communication. This system of speech ethics extends far beyond simplistic prohibitions against lying or slander, addressing the profound impact that words have on individuals, communities, and society. The meticulous development of these principles reflects Judaism's understanding that speech possesses remarkable power—to heal or harm, to build or destroy—and thus requires conscious ethical regulation.
