Shalom Bayit (שלום בית), literally "peace of the house," represents a fundamental Jewish value that emphasizes the importance of creating and maintaining a peaceful, harmonious household. This concept extends beyond mere conflict resolution to encompass the cultivation of a home environment infused with tranquility, respect, mutual support, and spiritual purpose. Throughout Jewish history, sages and teachers have emphasized that the home serves as a mikdash me'at (small sanctuary), a sacred space where divine presence can dwell among family members.

## Fundamental Concepts
