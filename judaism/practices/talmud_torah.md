Talmud Torah, the practice of Torah study, stands as a cornerstone of Jewish religious life and represents one of Judaism's most distinctive and enduring values. More than merely an intellectual pursuit, Torah study in Judaism constitutes a religious act in itselfâ€”a form of divine worship, a method of connecting with God, and a foundational practice that has preserved Jewish identity and tradition across millennia of historical challenges.
