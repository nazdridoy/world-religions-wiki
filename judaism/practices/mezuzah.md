The mezuzah (מְזוּזָה) stands as one of Judaism's most visible and widespread ritual objects—a small parchment scroll containing biblical text placed within a decorative case and affixed to the doorposts of Jewish homes. Beyond serving as a recognizable marker of Jewish household identity, the mezuzah embodies profound theological concepts relating to divine protection, covenant relationship, and the sanctification of domestic space. This ritual object transforms ordinary thresholds into portals of spiritual significance, marking the boundary between the public world and the sacred sphere of Jewish family life.
