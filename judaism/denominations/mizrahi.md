# Mizrahi Judaism

![Traditional Mizrahi Torah scrolls](mizrahi_torah.jpg)

Mizrahi Judaism (Hebrew: יהדות המזרח, Yahadut HaMizrah) encompasses the religious traditions, practices, customs, and cultural expressions of Jewish communities that developed primarily in the Middle East, North Africa, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the greater Iran region. The term "Mizrahi" (meaning "Eastern" in Hebrew) distinguishes these communities from the Ashkenazi (European) and Sephardi (Iberian-origin) Jewish traditions, though there is significant overlap with Sephardi communities, particularly following the expulsion from Spain in 1492.
