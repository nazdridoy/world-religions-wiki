The Conservative movement's approach to halacha (Jewish law) represents a distinctive middle path in contemporary Judaism, balancing reverence for traditional Jewish law with recognition of its historical development and the need for thoughtful adaptation to modern circumstances. This approach is characterized by commitment to both tradition and change, historical scholarship and religious observance, communal standards and individual autonomy.
