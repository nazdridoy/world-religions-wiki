# Pharisees

![Ancient synagogue remains](pharisees_synagogue.jpg)

The Pharisees were one of the most influential Jewish religious movements during the Second Temple period (approximately 515 BCE to 70 CE). Distinguished by their emphasis on the Oral Torah, synagogue worship, and adapting Jewish law to changing circumstances, they represented a more populist approach to Judaism than their contemporaries. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Pharisaic Judaism evolved into Rabbinic Judaism, making the Pharisees the direct ancestral tradition of modern Judaism.
