# Judaism as a Civilization

![Cultural expressions of Judaism](judaism_civilization.jpg)

"Judaism as a Civilization" is the foundational concept of Reconstructionist Judaism, first articulated by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan in his 1934 seminal work of the same name. This revolutionary paradigm redefined Judaism beyond traditional religious categorization, reconceiving it as a comprehensive civilization encompassing religion alongside cultural, historical, artistic, linguistic, and social dimensions. This expansive understanding of Jewish identity has profoundly influenced contemporary Jewish thought across denominational lines, offering a framework that accommodates diverse forms of Jewish expression and belonging beyond strictly religious parameters.
