# Conservative Judaism Overview

![Conservative synagogue service](conservative_synagogue.jpg)

Conservative Judaism (also known as Masorti Judaism outside North America) is a major Jewish denomination that positions itself as a middle path between Orthodox and Reform Judaism. It seeks to conserve Jewish tradition while also allowing for thoughtful adaptation to modern life through a scholarly approach to Jewish texts and history. This movement balances reverence for Jewish law (halakha) with an understanding that legal development has always been part of the Jewish tradition.
