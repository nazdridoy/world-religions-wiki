![Humanistic Judaism celebration](humanistic_judaism.jpg)

Humanistic Judaism is a movement within Judaism that emphasizes humanistic and secular values, rather than belief in a supernatural God. Founded in 1963 by Rabbi Sherwin Wine in Michigan, it offers a non-theistic alternative for Jewish life, celebrating Jewish history, culture, and identity without requiring traditional theological beliefs. Humanistic Judaism embraces science, reason, and human autonomy while maintaining meaningful connections to Jewish traditions, holidays, and ethics through reinterpreted rituals and ceremonies.
