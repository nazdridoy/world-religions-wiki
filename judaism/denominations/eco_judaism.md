Eco-Judaism represents a significant focus within Jewish Renewal that integrates environmental consciousness with Jewish spirituality, practice, and ethics. Drawing on ancient Jewish teachings about humanity's relationship with the natural world while responding to contemporary ecological crises, this approach seeks to create a Judaism that is ecologically sustainable, spiritually meaningful, and ethically responsible. Jewish Renewal's embrace of eco-Judaism has influenced Jewish communities across denominational lines, making environmental awareness an increasingly central element of contemporary Jewish life.
