Haredi Judaism, commonly known as Ultra-Orthodox Judaism, is a branch of Orthodox Judaism characterized by its strict adherence to traditional Jewish law and customs, rejection of modern secular culture, and insular community structures. Haredi communities are defined by their rigorous religious observance, distinctive appearance, and commitment to preserving what they view as authentic Judaism against the influences of modernity.
