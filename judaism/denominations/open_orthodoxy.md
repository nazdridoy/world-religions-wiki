Open Orthodoxy is a relatively recent movement within Modern Orthodox Judaism that seeks to combine Orthodox commitment to Jewish law (halakha) with greater openness to contemporary values, intellectual inquiry, and engagement with the broader world. The movement emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s and represents an attempt to create a more inclusive and progressive expression of Orthodox Judaism while maintaining halakhic commitment.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Founding

- Founded by Rabbi Avi Weiss in the late 1990s
- Formally named "Open Orthodoxy" in a 1997 article by Rabbi Weiss
- Developed as a response to perceived rightward shift in Modern Orthodoxy
