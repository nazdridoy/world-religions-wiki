# Cultural Judaism

![Jewish cultural celebration](cultural_judaism.jpg)

Cultural Judaism refers to a Jewish identity centered on cultural, historical, and ethnic connections rather than religious belief or practice. Adherents identify as Jewish primarily through shared heritage, values, customs, language, literature, arts, food, humor, and historical experience, while typically maintaining a secular worldview. This approach to Jewish identity emerged prominently in the modern era as Jews gained citizenship rights in Western societies and as secular ideologies like socialism, liberalism, and nationalism influenced Jewish communities worldwide.
