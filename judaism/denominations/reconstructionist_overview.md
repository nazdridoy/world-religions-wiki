Reconstructionist Judaism is a progressive Jewish movement founded in the early 20th century by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan. It represents a modern approach to Jewish tradition that views Judaism primarily as an evolving religious civilization rather than solely as a religion or ethnicity.

## Core Principles and Beliefs

### Judaism as a Civilization

- Judaism encompasses religion, culture, literature, art, ethics, and folkways
- Religious elements are one component of a broader Jewish civilizational identity
- Emphasizes cultural and ethnic aspects alongside religious dimensions

### Naturalistic Theology

- Rejects supernatural understanding of God and divine intervention
- Views God not as a personal being but as "the power or process that makes for salvation"
- Redefines God as the sum of natural processes that allow humans to become self-fulfilled
- Prefers to speak of "godliness" rather than a personal deity

### Democracy of Jewish Life

- Authority rests within the community rather than in hierarchical structures
- Each generation has the right and responsibility to reinterpret tradition
- Values both individual autonomy and communal responsibility
- Democratic governance in congregational life

### Evolving Religious Civilization

- Judaism has continuously adapted throughout history
- Tradition has a "vote but not a veto" in contemporary decision-making
- Emphasizes the need to reconstruct Judaism for the modern era

### Chosen People Concept Redefined

- Reframes as "choosing" rather than "chosenness"
- Emphasizes ethical responsibility rather than divine election

## Religious Practice

### Halakhic Approach
