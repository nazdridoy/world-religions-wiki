Reform Judaism (also known as Liberal or Progressive Judaism in various countries) is a major denomination within modern Judaism that emphasizes the evolving nature of the faith, ethical aspects of Jewish tradition, and integration with surrounding society while deemphasizing ritual observance and traditional Jewish law.
