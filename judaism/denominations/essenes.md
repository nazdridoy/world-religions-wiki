# Essenes

The Essenes were a Jewish religious sect that flourished from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE during the Second Temple period. Known for their ascetic lifestyle, communal living, strict ritual purity, and apocalyptic worldview, they separated themselves from mainstream Jewish society to pursue what they considered a more authentic form of Judaism. While having no direct successors, the Essenes represent an important example of Second Temple period Jewish diversity and have gained renewed attention with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
