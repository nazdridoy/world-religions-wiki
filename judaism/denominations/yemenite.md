# Yemenite Judaism

![Yemenite Jewish Torah reading](yemenite_torah_reading.jpg)

Yemenite Judaism (יהדות תימן, Yahadut Teman) represents one of the most ancient and distinctive Jewish traditions, preserved in relative isolation in the Arabian Peninsula for nearly two millennia. Known for its unique liturgical traditions, pronunciation of Hebrew, religious customs, and cultural expressions, Yemenite Jewry maintained practices that some scholars believe closely resemble those of pre-destruction Temple-era Judaism. This community's history of isolation, persecution, and eventual migration to Israel offers important insights into Jewish cultural preservation and adaptation.
