![People engaged in davvenen with full kavvanah](davvenen_practice.jpg)

Davvenology, a term coined by Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, refers to the systematic study and practice of Jewish prayer (davvenen) with an emphasis on its spiritual, psychological, and communal dimensions. Going beyond mere recitation of traditional prayers, davvenology explores how to achieve deep states of connection, meaning, and spiritual presence through prayer. This approach has been primarily developed within the Jewish Renewal movement but has influenced prayer practices across contemporary Judaism.
