![Havurah study and prayer group](havurah_group.jpg)

The Havurah movement represents a grassroots approach to Jewish communal life that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, emphasizing intimate fellowship, participatory worship, Jewish learning, and shared responsibility. The term "havurah" (plural: havurot) derives from the Hebrew word for "fellowship" or "friendship group," and these communities typically function as small, close-knit groups operating either independently or within larger synagogue settings.
