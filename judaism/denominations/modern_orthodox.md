Modern Orthodox Judaism represents a movement within Orthodox Judaism that seeks to maintain strict adherence to traditional Jewish law (halakha) while simultaneously engaging with and participating in modern secular society. It balances religious observance with integration into contemporary culture, education, and professional life.

## Historical Development

### Origins in Germany

- Emerged in the mid-19th century Germany as a response to both Reform Judaism and ultra-traditionalism
- Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808-1888) developed the philosophy of "Torah im Derech Eretz" (Torah with worldly engagement)
- Hirsch established the independent Orthodox community in Frankfurt with modern education alongside traditional learning
- Advocated for Jews to be faithful to Torah while participating in modern civilization

### Development in America

- Rabbi Bernard Revel founded Yeshiva College (later Yeshiva University) in 1915, combining Torah study with secular education
- Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik ("The Rav") became the philosophical leader of Modern Orthodoxy in America
