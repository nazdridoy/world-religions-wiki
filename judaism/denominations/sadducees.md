# Sadducees

![Temple priests performing rituals](sadducees_temple.jpg)

The Sadducees were an influential religious and political faction in Judea during the Second Temple period (approximately 515 BCE to 70 CE). Predominantly composed of aristocratic priestly families, the Sadducees held significant power in the Temple hierarchy and the Sanhedrin (Jewish high court). They were characterized by their literal interpretation of the written Torah, rejection of oral tradition, and conservative approach to religious innovation. The Sadducees disappeared as a distinct group after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE.
