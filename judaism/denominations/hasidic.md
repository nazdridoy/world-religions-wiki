# Hasidic Judaism

![Hasidic Jews in traditional garb](hasidic_jews.jpg)

Hasidic Judaism (חסידות, Hasidut) is a mystical, pietistic, and socially distinctive branch of Orthodox Judaism that emerged in the 18th century in Eastern Europe. Founded by Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer (known as the Baal Shem Tov), this movement emphasized direct communion with God through joy, prayer, and righteous living rather than exclusively through scholarly Torah study. Hasidism revolutionized Jewish religious life by making spiritual elevation accessible to ordinary Jews and creating communities centered around charismatic rebbes (spiritual leaders). Despite near destruction during the Holocaust, Hasidic Judaism has experienced remarkable revival and growth, becoming one of the most visible and dynamic expressions of contemporary Jewish life.
