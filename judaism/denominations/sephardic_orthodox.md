Sephardic Orthodox Judaism encompasses the traditional religious practices, legal rulings, customs, and cultural expressions of Jews descended from the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) and more broadly the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Jewish communities. Distinguished by its unique approach to Jewish law, liturgical traditions, cultural expressions, and historical experiences, Sephardic Orthodoxy represents a rich alternative to the Ashkenazic (Central/Eastern European) tradition that has often dominated contemporary Orthodox Judaism. With its own rabbinic authorities, legal codes, and interpretive traditions, Sephardic Orthodoxy maintains distinctive approaches to religious observance while sharing the fundamental commitment to halachic (Jewish law) observance that characterizes all Orthodox Judaism.
