Karaite Judaism (Hebrew: יהדות קראית, Yahadut Qara'it) is a Jewish religious movement characterized by its exclusive reliance on the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) as the sole source of binding Jewish law and practice, rejecting the authority of the Oral Law as codified in the Talmud and rabbinic tradition. Emerging in the 8th-9th centuries CE in Mesopotamia, Karaism represents one of the most significant historical alternatives to Rabbinic Judaism.
