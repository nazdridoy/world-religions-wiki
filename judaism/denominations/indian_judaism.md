Indian Judaism represents a collection of distinct Jewish communities that developed on the Indian subcontinent over many centuries, each with their own unique histories, traditions, and relationships to both broader Jewish practice and local Indian culture. These communities—primarily the Bene Israel, Cochin Jews, Baghdadi Jews, and Bnei Menashe—maintained Jewish identity and practice while integrating aspects of Indian culture, creating distinctive expressions of Judaism that reflect both their Jewish heritage and their Indian context. With histories spanning possibly two millennia, these communities demonstrate the adaptability of Jewish tradition across diverse cultural settings and offer important perspectives on religious continuity, cultural synthesis, and the dynamics of minority religious identity.
