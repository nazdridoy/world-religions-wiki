Classical Reform Judaism was the first and most radical expression of Reform Judaism that emerged in early 19th century Germany and later flourished in the United States until the mid-20th century. This movement represented a dramatic departure from traditional Judaism, emphasizing universal ethical principles over ritual observance, rational understanding over mysticism, and integration with Western culture. Classical Reform sought to modernize Judaism to align with Enlightenment values while maintaining its essential ethical monotheism.
