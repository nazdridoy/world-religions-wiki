Conversion to Judaism (giyur) involves a process through which a non-Jewish person becomes a member of the Jewish people and religion. Throughout Jewish history, approaches to conversion have evolved, reflecting changing social circumstances, theological perspectives, and communal needs. In the modern period, conversion standards have become a significant point of contention between different Jewish denominations, with implications for personal identity, communal boundaries, and institutional recognition.
