![Portrait of Sabbatai Zevi](sabbatai_zevi.jpg)

The Sabbatean movement was one of the most significant and controversial messianic movements in Jewish history, emerging in the mid-17th century around the figure of Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676), who proclaimed himself the Jewish Messiah. At its height, this movement attracted perhaps up to one-third of the world's Jewish population, causing profound social upheaval before collapsing after Zevi's conversion to Islam under Ottoman pressure. Despite this apparent failure, various forms of Sabbateanism persisted underground for centuries, developing unique theological innovations and challenging rabbinic orthodoxy.
