# Frankists

![Jacob Frank, leader of the Frankist movement](jacob_frank.jpg)

The Frankists were followers of Jacob Frank (1726-1791), a Jewish religious leader who claimed to be the reincarnation of Sabbatai Zevi and the messiah. The Frankist movement emerged in the mid-18th century in Poland and spread to other parts of Central and Eastern Europe, representing an extreme and radical development of Sabbateanism. Characterized by antinomian practices, mass conversion to Christianity, secretive rituals, and controversial theological innovations, the Frankists provoked one of the most severe internal crises in early modern Jewish history.
