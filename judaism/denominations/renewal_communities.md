# Jewish Renewal Communities: Models of Spiritual Innovation

![A Jewish Renewal community gathering for prayer and celebration](renewal_community.jpg)

Jewish Renewal communities represent diverse implementations of the Jewish Renewal approach to Jewish spiritual life. Rather than following a single organizational model, these communities share core values and practices while each developing distinctive expressions based on local needs, leadership, and focus areas. From urban centers to rural retreats, from formal congregations to informal circles, Jewish Renewal communities create laboratories for exploring contemporary expressions of Jewish spirituality that balance innovation with tradition, inclusivity with Jewish particularity, and personal spiritual growth with communal responsibility.
