The Positive-Historical School represents the intellectual and ideological foundation of Conservative Judaism. Developed in 19th-century Germany by Rabbi Zacharias Frankel (1801-1875), this approach sought a middle path between Orthodox adherence to tradition and Reform's radical innovations, proposing a historically conscious yet traditionally committed approach to Judaism.

## Origins and Development

### Historical Context

- Emerged in mid-19th century Germany during the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah)
- Response to both Orthodox resistance to change and Reform's radical departures
- Developed during a period of Jewish emancipation and integration into European society
- Influenced by growing historical consciousness in Western intellectual thought
- Positioned as a moderate alternative in an increasingly polarized Jewish religious landscape

### Zacharias Frankel's Leadership

- Born in Prague in 1801 to a traditionally observant family
- Received both traditional Jewish and modern secular education
- Served as rabbi in Dresden (1836-1854)
- Broke with more radical reformers at the Frankfurt Rabbinical Conference in 1845
- Founded the Jewish Theological Seminary in Breslau in 1854
- Cultivated a generation of historically-minded, moderately progressive rabbis
- Published influential works on Jewish law and Mishnah development

### Key Developmental Phases

1. **Formative Phase (1840s-1850s)**: Frankel's break with radical reform and articulation of core principles
2. **Institutional Phase (1854-1875)**: Establishment of Breslau Seminary as center of the movement
3. **Expansion Phase (1875-1900)**: Spread of ideas through seminary graduates
