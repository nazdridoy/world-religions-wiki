# Mordecai Kaplan

![Portrait of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan](mordecai_kaplan.jpg)

Rabbi Mordecai Menahem Kaplan (1881-1983) was one of the most influential and innovative Jewish thinkers of the 20th century, the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, and a transformative figure in modern Jewish thought. As a rabbi, educator, philosopher, and communal leader, Kaplan developed a naturalistic approach to Judaism that reconceived it as an evolving religious civilization rather than solely a religion of revealed law. His ideas challenged traditional theological concepts while seeking to maintain Judaism's relevance in the modern world, profoundly impacting contemporary Jewish denominational boundaries and religious practices.
