Sephardi Judaism refers to the religious traditions, practices, customs, and cultural expressions of Jews whose origins trace back to the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain and Portugal). The term "Sephardi" derives from "Sepharad," the Hebrew word for Spain. Following their expulsion from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497, Sephardi Jews spread throughout the Mediterranean basin, North Africa, the Ottoman Empire, Western Europe, and eventually the Americas, maintaining distinctive religious traditions while adapting to diverse new environments.
