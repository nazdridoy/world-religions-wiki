Ethiopian Judaism, also known as Beta Israel ("House of Israel") or sometimes by the term "Falasha" (though many consider this term pejorative), represents a unique and ancient Jewish tradition that developed in relative isolation in the highlands of Ethiopia. With distinctive religious practices, a separate canonical literature, and a complex history of relationships with both Ethiopian Christianity and world Jewry, the Beta Israel maintained a strong Jewish identity for centuries before their dramatic airlifts to Israel in the late 20th century. Their story encompasses themes of religious persistence, cultural adaptation, disputed origins, and the challenges of integration into modern Israeli society.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early History

  - Ancient origin from Israelite tribes (possibly Dan) that migrated to Ethiopia
