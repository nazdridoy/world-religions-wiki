# Evolving Covenant

![Two generations studying Torah together](evolving_covenant.jpg)

The concept of the Evolving Covenant is a cornerstone of Reconstructionist Jewish theology, offering a distinctive approach to understanding the relationship between God, the Jewish people, and Jewish tradition. Rejecting both rigid Orthodox literalism and radical Reform selectivity, this approach sees the covenant between God and Israel as a dynamic, historical process that continues to develop through human interpretation and communal decision-making. First articulated by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan and refined by subsequent Reconstructionist thinkers, the Evolving Covenant provides a framework for maintaining meaningful connection to tradition while embracing change and responding to contemporary values.

## Theological Foundations

### Kaplan's Original Formulation

- Rejection of the supernatural "command theory" of revelation
- Understanding covenant as metaphor rather than literal historical event
- Viewing God as "the power that makes for salvation" rather than a supernatural being
- Framing Jewish history as evolutionary process rather than divine dictation
- Emphasis on "religious civilization" encompassing more than theological beliefs
- Focus on function of religious traditions rather than claims of supernatural origin
- Recognition of human agency in creating and interpreting sacred texts
- Balance between cultural inheritance and moral progression
