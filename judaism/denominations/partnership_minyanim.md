# Partnership Minyanim

![Partnership minyan with women participating in Torah service](partnership_minyan.jpg)

Partnership Minyanim are prayer communities that attempt to maximize women's participation in Orthodox Jewish synagogue services while remaining within the parameters of Orthodox halakha (Jewish law). They represent a distinctive approach to balancing traditional Orthodox interpretations of Jewish law with contemporary egalitarian values, creating a unique space within the broader spectrum of Jewish denominational expressions.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early Communities

- First established partnership minyan, Shira Hadasha, founded in Jerusalem in 2002
- Co-founded by Rabbi Dr. Daniel Sperber and Tova Hartman
- Darkhei Noam established in New York City in 2002 as first American example
- Spread primarily in urban centers with educated Orthodox populations
- Inspired by academic halakhic research on women's participation possibilities

### Intellectual Foundations

- Built on Rabbi Mendel Shapiro's 2001 article on women's aliyot in The Edah Journal
- Supported by Rabbi Daniel Sperber's halakhic analyses
- Influenced by Orthodox feminist scholarship from JOFA (Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance)
- Developed formal and informal networks for sharing practices and resources
- Emerged from Modern Orthodox and Open Orthodox communities

### Growth and Expansion

- Rapid growth from 2002-2012 in urban centers globally
- Approximately 70 partnership minyanim worldwide by 2022
- Strongest presence in Israel, United States, and Canada
- Regular international conferences beginning in 2007
- Development of common liturgical and organizational practices

## Core Characteristics

### Halakhic Framework

- Commitment to Orthodox interpretation of Jewish law
- Based on minority but defensible Orthodox halakhic positions
- Searches for maximum women's participation within halakhic boundaries
- Distinguishes between obligations (hovot) and privileges (reshut)
- Differentiates between public and private ritual domains

### Physical Layout

- Mechitza (divider) separating men and women during prayer
- Often uses a tri-section arrangement (men, women, bimah/Torah reading platform)
- Central bimah accessible to both men and women
- Balanced space allocation for men's and women's sections
- Adjustments to traditional synagogue architecture to facilitate participation

### Leadership Structure

- Usually lay-led rather than rabbi-led communities
- Rotating leadership roles among community members
- Collaborative decision-making processes
- Often organized as independent minyanim outside institutional structures
- Women on leadership committees and boards

## Liturgical Practices

### Women's Roles in Prayer Services

- Women may lead specific parts of the service (pesukei d'zimra, kabbalat Shabbat)
- Women remain excluded from leading core obligations (e.g., Shema, Amidah)
- Women may receive aliyot (be called up to the Torah)
- Women may read from the Torah (kriyat haTorah)
- Women may deliver sermons and divrei Torah (Torah teachings)

### Torah Service Protocols

- Seven aliyot typically divided between men and women
- Men usually receive aliyot requiring a minyan (quorum) of men
- Women may serve as gabbai'ot (Torah service coordinators)
- Women may carry the Torah scroll
- Both men and women participate in hagbah (lifting) and gelilah (wrapping)

### Prayer Leadership Distinctions

- Services requiring a male minyan led by men (devarim she-bikdusha)
- Services not requiring a minyan may be led by women
- Some communities develop detailed lists of permitted/prohibited roles
- Ongoing evolution of practices as halakhic discourse develops
- Respect for traditional prayer melodies and nusach (liturgical traditions)

## Communal Aspects
