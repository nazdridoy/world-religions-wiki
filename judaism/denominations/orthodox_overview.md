# Orthodox Judaism Overview

![Orthodox Jewish prayer at the Western Wall](orthodox_prayer.jpg)

Orthodox Judaism is the approach to Jewish religion that adheres to the traditional interpretation and application of Jewish law and practice. Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah (both Written and Oral Law) was received by Moses at Mount Sinai and has been transmitted accurately through the generations. It is characterized by strict observance of halakha (Jewish law), belief in the divine origin of the Torah, and resistance to changes in traditional practices.

### The Term "Orthodox"

- Originally used by non-Orthodox and critics in early 19th century
- Derived from Greek, meaning "correct belief" or "correct opinion"
- Initially rejected by traditionalists as a foreign, non-Jewish label
