# Jewish Renewal Movement: A Contemporary Spiritual Revitalization

![Jewish Renewal celebration with singing and dancing](renewal_celebration.jpg)

Jewish Renewal represents one of the most creative and influential spiritual revitalization movements in contemporary Judaism. Neither a formal denomination nor simply a set of practices, Jewish Renewal blends the mystical and prophetic traditions of Judaism with contemporary innovations to create an approach that emphasizes spiritual experience, social justice, environmental consciousness, and inclusivity. Emerging in the late 1960s and early 1970s through the work of Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi and others, Jewish Renewal has influenced practices across all major branches of Judaism while maintaining its distinct identity as a transformative approach to Jewish religious life.
