Judaism is one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions, with a history spanning over 3,500 years. It encompasses a rich tapestry of religious beliefs, practices, texts, cultural traditions, and historical experiences centered on the covenant relationship between God and the Jewish people.

## Overview

Judaism originated with the biblical Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Israel) and developed through various historical periods including the Exodus from Egypt, the revelation at Mount Sinai, the monarchic period, exile, Second Temple era, and rabbinic Judaism. Its continued evolution has produced diverse expressions ranging from strict traditional observance to progressive and secular forms.

Core elements include belief in one God, the authority of the Torah (both Written and Oral), the special covenant relationship between God and the Jewish people, ethical monotheism, and the expectation of a messianic age of universal peace and justice.
