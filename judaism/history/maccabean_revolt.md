The Maccabean Revolt (167-160 BCE) was a watershed event in Jewish history that altered the course of Judaism and set the stage for later religious and political developments. This rebellion against Seleucid rule and Hellenistic cultural dominance reestablished Jewish autonomy in Judea for the first time since the Babylonian conquest and created the conditions for the emergence of major Jewish religious movements.

## Historical Context

### Seleucid Rule in Judea

- **Political Background** (323-167 BCE):
  - Alexander's empire divided after his death in 323 BCE
  - Judea initially under Ptolemaic (Egyptian) control
  - Seleucid Empire (Syrian-based) gained control in 198 BCE
  - Initial relationship between Seleucids and Jews was favorable
  - Empire weakened by Roman expansion and financial pressures

- **Jewish Society Under Hellenism**:
  - Polarization between Hellenizers and traditionalists
  - Elite classes more receptive to Greek culture
  - High priesthood became political appointment
  - Tensions between rural population and Jerusalem aristocracy
  - Temple remained central religious institution

### Immediate Causes

- **Antiochus IV Epiphanes** (ruled 175-164 BCE):
  - Self-styled as "God Manifest" (Epiphanes)
  - Aggressive Hellenization policies throughout empire
  - Faced financial crisis after defeat by Romans (Treaty of Apamea)
  - Increasingly arbitrary and oppressive rule

- **Political Crisis in Jerusalem** (175-167 BCE):
  - Jason (pro-Hellenist) purchases high priesthood
  - Establishes Greek-style gymnasium in Jerusalem
  - Menelaus outbids Jason for high priesthood
  - Civil strife between competing factions
  - False rumors of Antiochus's death trigger conflicts

- **Religious Persecution** (167 BCE):
  - Antiochus pillages Jerusalem Temple treasury
  - Prohibits core Jewish practices (circumcision, Sabbath, dietary laws)
  - Introduces pagan worship in Temple (Zeus Olympios)
  - Sacrifices pigs on the altar ("Abomination of Desolation")
  - Brutal enforcement including executions of dissenters
