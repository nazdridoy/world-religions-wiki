# The Persian Period in Jewish History

![Cyrus Cylinder depicting Persian policy](cyrus_cylinder.jpg)

The Persian Period (539-332 BCE) represents a pivotal era in Jewish history that witnessed the restoration of Jewish life in Judea following the Babylonian Exile. Beginning with Cyrus the Great's conquest of Babylon and ending with Alexander's defeat of the Persian Empire, this period saw the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple, the reconstitution of Jewish communal institutions, and significant religious developments that would profoundly shape Judaism's future trajectory. Under Persian imperial administration, which generally allowed for local religious and cultural autonomy, Jews began the crucial process of redefining their identity and religious practice in a post-exilic world.
