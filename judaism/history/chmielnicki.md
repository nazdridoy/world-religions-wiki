The Chmielnicki Massacres, also known as the Khmelnytsky Uprising, were a series of violent attacks against Jews and Polish nobles in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, led by Cossack forces under Bohdan Chmielnicki. These events marked one of the most devastating episodes in Jewish history, resulting in the destruction of hundreds of communities and the deaths of tens of thousands of Jews.
