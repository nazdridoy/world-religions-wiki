The history of medieval Jewish communities is deeply marked by waves of persecution, particularly during the Crusades and other periods of religious fervor in Christian Europe. These experiences fundamentally shaped Jewish communal life, religious practice, and theological perspectives. From the First Crusade in 1096 through the expulsions of the 14th and 15th centuries, European Jewish communities faced existential threats that resulted in martyrdom, forced conversions, migration, and the development of religious and cultural responses to trauma and displacement.
