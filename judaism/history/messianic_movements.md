Messianic movements have been a recurring theme in Jewish history, reflecting hopes for redemption, national restoration, and spiritual renewal. These movements have arisen in response to crisis, persecution, and social upheaval, sometimes leading to profound religious innovation and, at times, to disappointment and division. This overview traces the major messianic movements and their impact on Jewish life from antiquity to the present.

## Biblical and Second Temple Roots

- **Biblical Prophecies**: Early visions of a future redeemer (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel)
- **Second Temple Expectations**: Apocalyptic and messianic hopes in late biblical and intertestamental literature (e.g., Dead Sea Scrolls)
- **Bar Kokhba Revolt (132-135 CE)**: Simon Bar Kokhba proclaimed as messiah; failed revolt against Rome

## Medieval and Early Modern Movements

- **Messianic Calculations**: Medieval attempts to predict the end of days
- **David Alroy (12th c.)**: Claimed messiah in Persia
- **Abraham Abulafia (13th c.)**: Mystical messianic teachings
- **Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676)**: Most famous false messiah; mass movement across the Jewish world; conversion to Islam and aftermath (see @sabbatai_zevi.md)
- **Jacob Frank (1726-1791)**: Radical messianic claimant in Poland; Frankist movement

## Modern and Contemporary Movements
