# The Babylonian Exile

![Babylon's Ishtar Gate](babylon_ishtar_gate.jpg)

The Babylonian Exile (586-539 BCE) represents one of the most pivotal and transformative periods in Jewish history. Following the destruction of the First Temple and the fall of Jerusalem to Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon, significant portions of Judah's population were forcibly relocated to Babylonia. This traumatic national catastrophe catalyzed profound religious, cultural, and institutional changes that would permanently reshape Judaism and establish foundations for its survival as a diaspora religion. The exile experience and the subsequent return under Persian rule fundamentally altered Jewish self-understanding and religious practice in ways that continue to influence Judaism to the present day.
