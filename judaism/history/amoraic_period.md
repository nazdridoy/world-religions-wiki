# The Amoraic Period

![Ancient Jewish academy reconstruction](amoraic_academy.jpg)

The Amoraic Period (roughly 220-500 CE) represents a pivotal era in Jewish intellectual and religious history when the foundations of rabbinic Judaism were solidified following the codification of the Mishnah. The Amoraim ("speakers" or "interpreters") were the scholarly sages who analyzed, expanded, and applied the Mishnah's concise legal statements, ultimately creating the vast corpus of the Gemara, which together with the Mishnah forms the Talmud.

## Historical Context
