# The Divided Kingdom

![Map of the Divided Kingdoms](divided_kingdom_map.jpg)

The Divided Kingdom period (c. 930-722 BCE for the Northern Kingdom; c. 930-586 BCE for the Southern Kingdom) represents a critical juncture in ancient Israelite history when the united monarchy established under Kings Saul, David, and Solomon fractured into two separate political entities: the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south.

## Historical Context

### Causes of the Division

- **Solomonic Policies**: King Solomon's heavy taxation, forced labor policies, and centralization of power created discontent
- **Tribal Tensions**: Long-standing tensions between northern tribes and the southern tribe of Judah
- **Religious Concerns**: Solomon's tolerance of foreign cults and worship practices
- **Succession Crisis**: Following Solomon's death (c. 930 BCE), his son Rehoboam failed to address northern grievances

### The Division

- **Jeroboam's Rebellion**: Jeroboam, an official under Solomon, led the northern tribes in revolt
- **Political Split**: Ten northern tribes formed the Kingdom of Israel (capital eventually at Samaria)
- **Southern Loyalty**: The tribes of Judah and Benjamin remained loyal to the Davidic dynasty, forming the Kingdom of Judah (capital at Jerusalem)
- **Failed Reunification**: Early attempts to reunite the kingdoms through military means were unsuccessful

## The Northern Kingdom (Israel)

### Political Development

- **Capital Cities**: Initially Shechem, then Tirzah, and finally Samaria
- **Dynasty Changes**: Nine different dynasties ruled over approximately 200 years
- **Notable Kings**:
  - Jeroboam I (931-910 BCE): Established alternative religious centers at Dan and Bethel
  - Omri (876-869 BCE): Built Samaria, strengthened the kingdom
  - Ahab (869-850 BCE): Expanded territory, allied with Phoenicia
  - Jeroboam II (786-746 BCE): Period of prosperity and territorial expansion

### Religious Practices

- **Golden Calves**: Placed at Dan and Bethel as alternative worship sites to Jerusalem
- **Syncretism**: Integration of Canaanite religious practices, especially Baal worship
- **Prophetic Opposition**: Elijah, Elisha, Amos, and Hosea strongly criticized religious policies
- **Samarian Ostraca**: Archaeological evidence showing administrative and economic organization

### International Relations

- **Wars with Aram-Damascus**: Frequent conflicts with the Aramean kingdom
- **Assyrian Pressure**: Increasing threat from the expanding Assyrian Empire
- **Coalition Building**: Temporary alliances with other regional powers against Assyria
- **Tribute Payment**: Often forced to pay tribute to avoid Assyrian invasion

### Downfall

- **Internal Instability**: Frequent coups and dynastic changes weakened the kingdom
- **Assyrian Conquest**: Tiglath-Pileser III began annexing territories (c. 740 BCE)
- **Final Destruction**: Samaria fell to Shalmaneser V and Sargon II (c. 722-720 BCE)
- **Deportation Policy**: Large portions of the population were exiled and replaced with foreign settlers

## The Southern Kingdom (Judah)

### Political Stability

- **Davidic Dynasty**: All kings descended from David, providing political continuity
- **Jerusalem Centrality**: The capital remained at Jerusalem throughout the period
- **Notable Kings**:
  - Rehoboam (930-913 BCE): Presided over the kingdom's division
  - Jehoshaphat (870-848 BCE): Reformed judicial system, strengthened kingdom
  - Hezekiah (715-687 BCE): Instituted religious reforms, resisted Assyria
  - Josiah (640-609 BCE): Major religious reformer who centralized worship

### Religious Developments

- **Temple Centrality**: The Jerusalem Temple remained the official worship center
- **Religious Reforms**: Periodic attempts to purify worship (especially under Hezekiah and Josiah)
- **Religious Syncretism**: Despite reforms, worship of other deities was common
- **Prophetic Activity**: Isaiah, Micah, Jeremiah, and others operated primarily in Judah

### International Relations

- **Egyptian Influence**: Periodic alliances and conflicts with Egypt
- **Assyrian Domination**: Became an Assyrian vassal state, especially after Sennacherib's campaign (701 BCE)
- **Babylonian Rise**: Shifted allegiance between Egypt and Babylon as Assyria declined
- **Failed Diplomacy**: Attempts to play major powers against each other ultimately failed

### Survival and Fall

- **Assyrian Survival**: Unlike Israel, Judah survived the Assyrian period
- **Babylon's Threat**: Rising Babylonian power under Nebuchadnezzar II
- **Three Sieges**: Jerusalem faced Babylonian attacks in 597, 587, and 586 BCE
- **Final Destruction**: The city and Temple were destroyed in 586 BCE, ending the kingdom

## The Prophetic Response

### Major Prophets of the Period

- **Elijah and Elisha**: Confronted Baal worship in the northern kingdom
- **Amos and Hosea**: Criticized social injustice and religious infidelity in Israel
- **Isaiah and Micah**: Addressed both religious and political issues in Judah
- **Jeremiah**: Witnessed and interpreted Judah's final days

### Prophetic Themes

- **Covenant Loyalty**: Call to faithfulness to God's covenant
- **Social Justice**: Criticism of exploitation of the poor and vulnerable
- **Religious Purity**: Opposition to worship of foreign deities
- **Political Caution**: Warnings against dangerous political alliances
- **Future Hope**: Promises of restoration beyond judgment

## Archaeological Evidence

- **Writing Development**: Increased literacy and administrative texts
- **Religious Artifacts**: Figurines and cult objects reflecting religious practices

## Historical Legacy

### Impact on Religious Development

## Theological Significance
