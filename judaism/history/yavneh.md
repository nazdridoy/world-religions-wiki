# The Yavneh Period

![Ancient Yavneh academy reconstruction](yavneh_academy.jpg)

The Yavneh period (70-132 CE) represents a critical transitional phase in Jewish history when, following the catastrophic destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, Judaism was fundamentally restructured from a Temple-centered sacrificial religion to a text-centered tradition focused on prayer, study, and communal worship. This remarkable transformation, orchestrated primarily at the coastal town of Yavneh (Jamnia), ensured Judaism's survival despite the loss of its central institution and established the foundations for Rabbinic Judaism that would shape Jewish life for the next two millennia.
