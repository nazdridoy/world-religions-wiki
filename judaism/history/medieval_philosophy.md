![Medieval Jewish manuscript page](medieval_philosophy_manuscript.jpg)

Medieval Jewish philosophy (roughly 800-1500 CE) represents a remarkable synthesis of Jewish religious thought with the philosophical traditions of the broader world, particularly Greek, Islamic, and Christian philosophy. During this period, Jewish thinkers grappled with fundamental questions about the nature of God, revelation, creation, and human purpose, producing works that continue to influence Jewish theology to this day.

## Historical Context

### Timeline and Development

- **Early Period**: c. 800-1000 CE (Saadia Gaon, Isaac Israeli)
- **Golden Age in Spain**: c. 1000-1200 CE (Solomon ibn Gabirol, Judah Halevi, Abraham ibn Ezra)
- **Maimonidean Period**: c. 1150-1300 CE (Moses Maimonides and his followers)
- **Late Medieval Period**: c. 1300-1500 CE (Gersonides, Hasdai Crescas, Joseph Albo)

### Intellectual Setting
