Jewish mysticism, particularly Kabbalah, represents a major spiritual current in Judaism that developed alongside mainstream rabbinic thought. With origins reaching back to early apocalyptic literature and merkavah (divine chariot) speculation, Kabbalah evolved into a sophisticated mystical system centered on understanding the nature of God, creation, and the soul's purpose. Its development from esoteric circles of initiates to a broader phenomenon significantly impacted Jewish religious life and thought.
