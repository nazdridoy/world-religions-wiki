Jewish communities have developed diverse forms of self-governance throughout history, enabling them to maintain religious, legal, and social autonomy even under foreign rule. These institutions provided leadership, resolved disputes, collected taxes, and represented Jewish interests to external authorities. This overview traces the evolution and significance of Jewish self-governance from antiquity to the modern era.
