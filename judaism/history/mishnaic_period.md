# The Mishnaic Period

![Ancient Mishnah manuscript](mishnaic_manuscript.jpg)

The Mishnaic Period (roughly 70-220 CE) represents a pivotal era in Jewish history when, following the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans, Judaism transformed from a Temple-centered religion into a text-centered one. This transitional period saw the codification of Jewish oral traditions into the Mishnah, establishing the foundation for Rabbinic Judaism that would ensure Jewish survival through two millennia of diaspora existence.
