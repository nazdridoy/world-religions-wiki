The Geonic Period (circa 650-1050 CE) represents a critical phase in the development of rabbinic Judaism, spanning approximately four centuries from the Muslim conquest of the Middle East to the decline of the Babylonian academies. Named after the Geonim—the formal heads of the prestigious academies of Sura and Pumbedita in Babylonia (modern Iraq)—this era saw the consolidation of talmudic authority, the development of systematic Jewish legal interpretation, and the formation of diaspora networks that would define medieval Jewish life.
