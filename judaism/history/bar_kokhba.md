The Bar Kokhba Revolt (132-136 CE) represents the last major Jewish uprising against Roman rule in antiquity and a pivotal moment in Jewish history. Led by Simon bar Kokhba (also called bar Kosiba), this failed rebellion against Roman imperial power resulted in catastrophic casualties, mass displacement, and profound religious and cultural transformations that shaped Jewish life for centuries thereafter.
