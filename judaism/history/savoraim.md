# The Savoraim

![Ancient Babylonian academy ruins](savoraic_period_academy.jpg)

The Savoraim (Aramaic: סבוראים, "reasoners" or "explainers") were Jewish scholars who played a crucial transitional role in the development of rabbinic Judaism during the period between the completion of the Amoraic discussions and the beginning of the Geonic era. Operating primarily in Babylonia from approximately 500 to 650 CE, these often-overlooked scholars were responsible for the final editing, arrangement, and transmission of the Babylonian Talmud, profoundly shaping its authoritative form.
