The Jewish ghetto was a form of enforced residential segregation that shaped Jewish life in many European cities from the late Middle Ages through the modern era. Ghettos were both sites of hardship and centers of vibrant communal, religious, and cultural life. This overview traces the origins, development, and legacy of Jewish ghettos.

## Origins and Early Development

- **Venice Ghetto (1516)**: First official Jewish ghetto; model for others in Italy and Europe
- **Spread of Ghettos**: Establishment in Rome, Prague, Frankfurt, and other cities
- **Legal Restrictions**: Curfews, gates, and limitations on movement and occupation

## Life in the Ghetto

- **Community Organization**: Synagogues, schools, and charitable institutions
- **Religious Life**: Maintenance of Jewish law, customs, and festivals
- **Economic Activity**: Trade, moneylending, crafts, and peddling
