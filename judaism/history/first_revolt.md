![Destruction of the Second Temple](temple_destruction.jpg)

The First Jewish Revolt (66-73 CE), also known as the Great Revolt or the Jewish War, was a major uprising of Jews in the Roman province of Judea against Roman rule. It culminated in the destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple in 70 CE, a catastrophic event that fundamentally transformed Judaism and Jewish life. The revolt marked the end of the Second Temple period and set the foundation for rabbinic Judaism's development.
