The Conquest of Canaan (traditionally dated c. 1210-1180 BCE) represents the pivotal transition from the wilderness wandering to the settlement of the Israelites in their promised homeland. Under the leadership of Joshua, Moses's successor, the biblical narrative describes a military campaign to occupy the territory God had promised to the patriarchs. This period established the geographical foundation for Israelite society and the future nation of Israel.
