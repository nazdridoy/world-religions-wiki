The Egyptian Bondage period (traditionally dated c. 1600-1250 BCE) represents a crucial transformative phase in Jewish history during which the descendants of Jacob/Israel evolved from an extended family into a numerous people. This period of enslavement and oppression in Egypt set the stage for the defining exodus experience that would become central to Jewish religious identity and collective memory.

## Historical Context

### Traditional Timeline

- **Period of oppression**: Generations of bondage and population growth
- **Moses's birth**: c. 1330 BCE, birth of the future liberator
- **Exodus**: c. 1250 BCE, departure from Egypt under Moses's leadership
