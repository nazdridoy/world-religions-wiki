The destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE represents one of the most pivotal and traumatic events in Jewish history. This catastrophe fundamentally transformed Judaism, forcing the transition from a Temple-centered religion to a faith based on prayer, study, and communal worship that could be practiced anywhere in the world.

## Historical Context

### The Jewish-Roman Relationship

- **Early Roman Rule**: Began with Pompey's conquest of Jerusalem in 63 BCE

- **Religious Affronts**: Roman actions perceived as sacrilegious by many Jews
- **Economic Pressures**: Heavy taxation and financial burdens on the population
- **Political Mismanagement**: Series of insensitive and corrupt Roman governors

### The Great Revolt (66-73 CE)

- **Outbreak of Violence**: Began in 66 CE with riots in Caesarea and Jerusalem
- **Initial Jewish Victory**: Rebels defeated the Roman garrison and Cestius Gallus' forces
- **Jewish Factionalism**: Internal disputes between moderate and radical rebel groups
- **Roman Response**: Emperor Nero dispatched Vespasian with substantial forces
- **Siege Strategy**: Methodical Roman campaign isolating Jerusalem
- **Vespasian's Ascension**: Became emperor in 69 CE during the campaign
- **Titus Takes Command**: Vespasian's son led the final assault on Jerusalem

## The Fall of Jerusalem

### The Siege of Jerusalem

- **Roman Forces**: Approximately 60,000-70,000 troops under Titus
