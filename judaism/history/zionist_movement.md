# The Zionist Movement

![Early Zionist Congress](zionist_congress.jpg)

The Zionist movement emerged in the late 19th century as a national revival movement aimed at establishing a Jewish homeland in the historic land of Israel (then Ottoman Palestine). Born amidst rising European nationalism and persistent antisemitism, Zionism represented a revolutionary response to the "Jewish Question" by asserting that Jewish life would remain precarious without political sovereignty. Under the leadership of Theodor Herzl and others, the movement transformed from a controversial minority position to one of the most successful national liberation movements of the 20th century, culminating in the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. Throughout its history, Zionism has encompassed diverse and sometimes competing ideological strands—political, cultural, religious, socialist, and revisionist—all united by the core principle of Jewish self-determination.
