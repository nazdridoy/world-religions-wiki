The Palestinian Talmud (Talmud Yerushalmi), also known as the Jerusalem Talmud, represents one of the two major compilations of Jewish oral law and rabbinic discussions produced during the late classical period. Although less well-known and less comprehensive than its Babylonian counterpart, the Palestinian Talmud provides unique insights into the development of rabbinic Judaism in the Land of Israel under Roman and Byzantine rule.

## Historical Context
