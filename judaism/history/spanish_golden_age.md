# The Spanish Golden Age (Convivencia)

![Illuminated page from Sephardic Haggadah](spanish_haggadah.jpg)

The Spanish Golden Age, spanning roughly from the 8th to the 15th centuries CE, represents one of the most flourishing periods in Jewish cultural and intellectual history. Under Muslim and, to a lesser extent, Christian rule in the Iberian Peninsula, Jews experienced a remarkable period of relative tolerance, cultural integration, and intellectual achievement. This era, often idealized as "Convivencia" (coexistence), produced outstanding advances in Jewish philosophy, poetry, medicine, and religious thought that continue to influence Judaism today.
