![Secular Jewish thinkers](secularization_judaism.jpg)

Secularization has been a major force in modern Jewish history, transforming religious practice, identity, and communal life. The process, which began in the Enlightenment and accelerated in the 19th and 20th centuries, led to the emergence of new forms of Jewish culture, politics, and self-understanding, as well as challenges to traditional authority. This overview traces the causes, manifestations, and consequences of secularization among Jews from the early modern period to the present.

## Early Modern Roots

- **Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment)**: 18th-19th centuries; emphasis on reason, integration, and secular education
- **Emancipation**: Legal equality in Europe; Jews enter broader society
- **Decline of Rabbinic Authority**: Rise of lay leadership and secular intellectuals

## 19th and Early 20th Centuries

- **Secular Jewish Movements**: Bundism (Jewish socialism), Zionism (nationalism), and cultural autonomy
- **Yiddish and Hebrew Secular Culture**: Literature, theater, journalism, and education
- **Religious Reform**: Development of Reform, Conservative, and other non-Orthodox movements
- **Assimilation**: Adoption of local languages, customs, and values
- **Secular Jewish Identity**: Redefinition of Jewishness as ethnicity, culture, or peoplehood

## Holocaust and Postwar Era

- **Destruction of Traditional Centers**: Impact of the Holocaust on religious life
- **New Centers of Jewish Life**: United States, Israel, and the Soviet Union
- **Secularization in Israel**: Tension between religious and secular Jews; creation of a secular public sphere
