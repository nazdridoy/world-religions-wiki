# The Reform Movement in Judaism

![Reform Jewish service](reform_service.jpg)

The Reform Movement (also known as Progressive, Liberal, or Reform Judaism) represents one of the most significant religious innovations in Jewish history since the rabbinic era. Emerging in early 19th-century Germany in response to Jewish political emancipation and the Enlightenment, Reform Judaism sought to modernize Jewish practice and belief while preserving Judaism's ethical core. The movement embraced critical historical study of Jewish texts, adapted ritual practices to contemporary sensibilities, and emphasized Judaism's ethical mission over ritual adherence. From its origins in Europe, Reform Judaism grew into a global movement, becoming the largest Jewish denomination in the United States and establishing communities worldwide. Throughout its development, the movement has continuously evolved, reexamining its positions on tradition, Zionism, ritual observance, and inclusion, while maintaining its fundamental commitment to the ongoing development of Judaism in dialogue with modernity.
