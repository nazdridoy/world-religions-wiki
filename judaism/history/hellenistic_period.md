# The Hellenistic Period in Jewish History

![Antiochus IV Epiphanes coin](antiochus_coin.jpg)

The Hellenistic period (332-63 BCE) represents a transformative and often turbulent era in Jewish history that began with Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire and continued until Pompey's Roman conquest of Judea. During these centuries, Jews encountered Greek civilization, politics, and philosophy with profound and lasting consequences. This cultural encounter reshaped Jewish society, sparked internal conflicts over assimilation versus tradition, and eventually led to the Maccabean Revoltâ€”a watershed event that temporarily restored Jewish independence. The Hellenistic period's complex legacy can still be seen in Judaism's theological, philosophical, and cultural development.
