The Tannaitic Era (approximately 10-220 CE) represents a pivotal transition period in Jewish history that followed the destruction of the Second Temple and saw the emergence of Rabbinic Judaism. Named after the Tannaim ("teachers" or "repeaters") who formulated the Oral Law into the Mishnah, this period established foundational texts, institutions, and concepts that would shape Judaism for the next two millennia.
