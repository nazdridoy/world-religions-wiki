# The Conservative Movement in Judaism

![Conservative synagogue](conservative_synagogue.jpg)

The Conservative Movement emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a middle path between Orthodox traditionalism and Reform liberalism. Committed to both Jewish law (halakhah) and historical development, Conservative Judaism (known as Masorti Judaism outside North America) embraces the evolution of Jewish tradition while maintaining core ritual practices and observances. The movement developed distinctive approaches to Jewish text study, ritual observance, and communal organization that profoundly shaped American Jewish religious life throughout the 20th century and continues to influence contemporary Jewish practice and thought worldwide.
