The Roman conquest of Judea (63 BCE) marked a profound turning point in Jewish history, ending the period of Hasmonean independence and initiating Roman domination that would shape Jewish religious, political, and social life for centuries. Pompey's intervention in the Jewish civil war between Hasmonean rivals transformed Judea from an independent kingdom into a Roman client state, with far-reaching consequences for Jewish autonomy and identity.

## Historical Context

### Hasmonean Background

- **Hasmonean Dynasty**: Jewish priestly family ruling an independent Judea since 142 BCE
- **Territorial Expansion**: Had achieved significant territorial gains under Alexander Jannaeus (r. 103-76 BCE)
- **Religious Authority**: Combined royal and high priestly offices in one person
- **Political Factions**: Growing tensions between Pharisees and Sadducees
- **Mixed Legacy**: Independence achieved but increasing Hellenization and corruption

### Regional Developments

- **Roman Expansion**: Increasingly dominant power in the eastern Mediterranean
- **Mithridatic Wars**: Roman conflicts with Pontus spilling into the region
- **Seleucid Collapse**: Final dissolution of the Seleucid Empire in 63 BCE
- **Regional Instability**: Power vacuum in Syria and surrounding territories
- **Pompey's Eastern Campaign**: Roman general Pompey reorganizing the East

## The Hasmonean Civil War

### Brothers in Conflict

- **Succession Crisis**: After death of Queen Salome Alexandra (76-67 BCE)
- **Rival Claimants**: Hyrcanus II (elder brother, supported by Pharisees) and Aristobulus II (younger brother)
- **Initial Outcome**: Aristobulus II seized power and became king/high priest
- **Continuing Struggle**: Hyrcanus II, encouraged by the Idumean advisor Antipater, continued to seek the throne
- **Foreign Intervention**: Both sides ultimately appealed to Rome for support

### Nabatean Involvement

- **Antipater's Strategy**: Secured support from King Aretas III of the Nabateans
- **Military Campaign**: Nabatean forces besieged Aristobulus II in Jerusalem in 65 BCE
- **Roman Reaction**: Roman general Scaurus ordered the Nabateans to withdraw
- **Regional Implications**: Demonstrated the vulnerability of Judea to outside powers

## Pompey's Intervention

### Diplomatic Maneuvering

- **Roman Arbitration**: Both brothers appealed to Pompey in Damascus
- **Third Delegation**: Representative from Jewish people requesting end to Hasmonean monarchy
- **Initial Decision**: Pompey appeared to favor Hyrcanus II's claim
- **Aristobulus' Response**: Attempted to prepare military resistance
- **Pompey's Decision**: Used this as pretext for direct military intervention

### Military Campaign

- **Roman Advance**: Pompey marched on Jerusalem in 63 BCE
- **Divided City**: Supporters of Hyrcanus II opened gates; Aristobulus' faction held Temple Mount
- **Three-Month Siege**: Romans besieged the Temple complex
- **Strategic Advantage**: Romans exploited Jewish Sabbath observance to build siege works
- **Final Assault**: Temple Mount taken with heavy Jewish casualties
- **Temple Violation**: Pompey entered the Holy of Holies, though he did not plunder Temple treasures

## Political Reorganization

### Territorial Changes

- **Loss of Territory**: All Hasmonean conquests outside of Judea proper removed
- **Coastal Cities**: Greek cities returned to independence under Roman protection
- **Decapolis**: Creation of league of ten Hellenistic cities east of Jordan

## Long-Term Consequences
