![Jews leaving Spain](spanish_expulsion.jpg)

The Expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492 stands as one of the most pivotal and traumatic events in Jewish history. Following centuries of vibrant Jewish life and cultural achievement in the Iberian Peninsula, the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella issued the Alhambra Decree (Edict of Expulsion), forcing the Jewish population to either convert to Christianity or leave Spain. This watershed moment dramatically altered the demographic, cultural, and intellectual landscape of world Jewry, creating new diasporic communities and reshaping Jewish identity for centuries to come.

## Historical Background
