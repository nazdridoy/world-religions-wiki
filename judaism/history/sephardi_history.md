# Sephardi Jewish History and Culture

![Sephardi synagogue interior](sephardi_synagogue.jpg)

Sephardi Judaism represents one of the major cultural traditions within the Jewish world, encompassing the Jewish communities that originated in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) and later spread throughout the Mediterranean basin, North Africa, the Ottoman Empire, and the Americas following the expulsions of 1492-1497. The Sephardi tradition developed distinctive religious practices, philosophical approaches, literary traditions, and cultural expressions that continue to influence world Jewry today. From the "Golden Age" of Jewish-Muslim-Christian coexistence in medieval Spain to the formation of diaspora communities after expulsion, Sephardi history reflects both cultural achievement and resilience in the face of persecution.
