## Life and Background

### Early Years and Education

Born in Baghdad, Iraq in 1920, Ovadia Yosef immigrated to Jerusalem with his family at age four. Despite humble beginnings, his extraordinary intellectual abilities were recognized early. He studied at the Porat Yosef Yeshiva, where he distinguished himself as a prodigy with a photographic memory and remarkable analytical skills.

By his twenties, he had mastered vast portions of rabbinic literature and developed an independent approach to halakhic decision-making that would characterize his later work. His phenomenal memory allowed him to cite thousands of sources verbatim, a skill that awed contemporaries throughout his life.

### Career and Leadership

After serving as a rabbi in Egypt in the 1940s, Yosef returned to Israel and held various rabbinic positions before being appointed Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv in 1968, and then Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel (Rishon LeZion) in 1973.

As Chief Rabbi, he worked to restore the distinctive Sephardic approach to Jewish law and resist what he saw as the domination of Ashkenazi (European Jewish) customs and legal rulings in Israel. His weekly Saturday night lectures broadcast on radio and later television drew massive audiences and made complex rabbinic discussions accessible to ordinary people.

In 1984, he founded the Shas political party, which became a major force in Israeli politics, giving voice to traditionally marginalized Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews and expanding his influence beyond the religious sphere into national policy.

### Later Years

After leaving the Chief Rabbinate, Rabbi Yosef remained Israel's most influential rabbinic figure. His home in Jerusalem became a pilgrimage site for the political and religious elite seeking his guidance and blessing. His weekly sermons continued to draw large audiences until his final illness.

His death in 2013 prompted national mourning in Israel, with his funeral attracting the largest attendance in Israeli history.
