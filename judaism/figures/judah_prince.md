## The Compilation of the Mishnah

### Historical Necessity

The compilation of the Mishnah responded to several urgent needs:
- Preserving the Oral Torah during a time of persecution and dispersion
- Creating an authoritative text to prevent sectarianism
- Organizing the vast body of halakhic traditions into a coherent system
- Establishing normative practice after periods of disagreement
- Providing a basis for Judaism's continuation without the Temple

### Methodology

Rabbi Judah's process involved:
1. Gathering existing collections of traditions, particularly those of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Nathan
2. Sorting and organizing material into six major orders (sedarim) and 63 tractates (masekhtot)
3. Selecting among conflicting opinions, often following the School of Hillel
4. Preserving minority opinions alongside accepted rulings
5. Editing material for clarity and conciseness
6. Including his own rulings, marked simply as "Rabbi says"
7. Creating a largely topic-based rather than scriptural organization

### Structure of the Mishnah

The completed Mishnah is organized into six orders:
1. **Zeraim** (Seeds) - Agricultural laws and blessings
2. **Moed** (Festivals) - Sabbath and holiday observances
3. **Nashim** (Women) - Marriage, divorce, and family law
4. **Nezikin** (Damages) - Civil and criminal law, ethics
5. **Kodashim** (Holy Things) - Temple sacrifice and ritual
6. **Tohorot** (Purities) - Ritual purity and impurity

### Historical Impact

The Mishnah's compilation:
- Marked the transition from a purely oral to a written tradition
- Became the core text of rabbinic Judaism
- Served as the foundation for the Gemara and thus the Talmud
