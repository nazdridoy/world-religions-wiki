# Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676)

![Portrait of Sabbatai Zevi](sabbatai_zevi_portrait.jpg)

## Life and Background

Sabbatai Zevi (also spelled Shabbetai Tzvi or Sabetay Sevi) was born in Smyrna (modern Izmir, Turkey) to a family of Romaniote Jews with Spanish Sephardic origins. His father was a merchant who served as the Spanish agent in Smyrna. From his youth, Sabbatai displayed both intellectual brilliance and peculiar behaviors. He studied Talmud and rabbinic literature but was particularly drawn to Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism, especially the teachings of Isaac Luria.

By his early twenties, Sabbatai began exhibiting signs of what modern scholars often interpret as manic-depressive disorder (bipolar disorder). During manic phases, he would perform strange symbolic acts and violate Jewish religious laws, while during depressive phases, he would withdraw into isolation and penitence.

## Messianic Claims

Sabbatai's messianic career formally began in 1648 when, during a manic episode, he pronounced the sacred four-letter name of God (the Tetragrammaton) in public—an act forbidden in Judaism—and declared himself the Messiah. This initial proclamation led to his excommunication by the rabbis of Smyrna, prompting him to wander through Greece, Thrace, Palestine, and Egypt.

His messianic movement gained significant momentum in 1665 when he met Nathan of Gaza, a charismatic young scholar who claimed to have had a prophetic vision confirming Sabbatai as the true Messiah. Nathan became Sabbatai's prophet and chief promoter, sending letters throughout the Jewish world announcing the imminent redemption under Sabbatai's leadership.

## The Movement

The Sabbatean movement spread with extraordinary speed across the Jewish diaspora, creating one of the largest messianic movements in Jewish history. Several factors contributed to its rapid growth:

### Historical Context

The movement arose shortly after the devastating Chmielnicki massacres of 1648-1649, which decimated Jewish communities in Poland and Ukraine. This tragedy, combined with general persecution and poverty, created fertile ground for messianic hopes.

### Mystical Atmosphere

The popularization of Lurianic Kabbalah had prepared many Jews to believe that the time of redemption was near. Lurianic teachings emphasized the concept of tikkun (cosmic repair) and suggested that certain mystical acts could hasten redemption.

### Communication Networks

Letters and emissaries spread news of the messianic claims throughout the Jewish world with unprecedented speed, connecting communities from Amsterdam to Yemen.

## The Movement's Peak and Practices

At its height in 1665-1666, the Sabbatean movement affected the majority of the world's Jewish communities. In many places:

- Normal business activity ceased as Jews prepared for imminent redemption
- Penitential practices spread, including fasting and self-mortification
- Festive celebrations accompanied expectations of redemption
- Special prayers were composed incorporating Sabbatai's name
- Pilgrims traveled to meet Sabbatai or send him gifts

Sabbatai himself enacted bizarre, antinomian rituals, including:
- Pronouncing the ineffable name of God
- Celebrating holidays on different dates
- Abolishing or modifying traditional fasts
- Symbolically violating Jewish dietary laws
- Instituting new religious practices

## Conversion to Islam

The movement reached its crisis point in 1666 when Sabbatai journeyed to Constantinople (Istanbul), ostensibly to depose the Sultan. He was arrested upon arrival and imprisoned. In September 1666, when brought before Sultan Mehmed IV, Sabbatai was given the choice between death and conversion to Islam. To the shock and dismay of his followers, he chose conversion, took the name Aziz Mehmed Effendi, and was granted a position in the Sultan's court.

This conversion shattered the movement, leaving followers to reconcile their messianic beliefs with the apparently inexplicable apostasy of their Messiah.

## Aftermath and Secret Followers

Despite his conversion, Sabbatai continued to practice some Jewish rituals in secret and maintained contact with certain followers until his death in exile in 1676 in Dulcigno, Albania (modern Ulcinj, Montenegro).

The movement did not disappear completely with his conversion but rather fractured into several responses:

### Orthodox Rejection

Mainstream Judaism vehemently rejected Sabbateanism, viewing the entire episode as a harmful delusion. Rabbis enacted measures against discussing or studying Sabbatean ideas.

### Rationalization and Secretive Continuation

Some followers developed theological explanations for Sabbatai's conversion, arguing that:
- The Messiah needed to descend into the realm of impurity to redeem the divine sparks trapped there
- The apostasy was part of a necessary cosmic mystery
- Traditional religious categories were being transcended in the messianic age

### Ma'aminim (Believers)

Some groups of secret Sabbateans continued to exist for centuries, particularly in Turkey (the Dönmeh), Poland, and Italy. These groups externally practiced normative Judaism (or in the case of the Dönmeh, Islam) while maintaining secret Sabbatean beliefs and practices.

## Theological Innovations and Controversies

Sabbateanism introduced several controversial theological concepts that influenced later Jewish thought:

### Antinomianism

The idea that with the coming of redemption, traditional religious laws were abrogated or transformed. Some Sabbateans adopted the principle that in the messianic age, "the violation of the Torah becomes its fulfillment."

### Nihilism

Extreme Sabbateans developed a form of religious nihilism, arguing that traditional categories of good and evil were no longer valid.

### Mystical Messianism

The movement emphasized personal mystical experience over institutional authority and reinterpreted traditional messianic concepts through a Kabbalistic lens.

## Historical Impact and Legacy

Sabbatai Zevi's movement had profound and lasting effects on Jewish history:

### Rabbinic Authority

The crisis weakened rabbinic authority in some areas and prompted rabbinic leadership to take a more conservative stance against mystical innovations.

### Hasidism

While Hasidism officially rejected Sabbateanism, scholars have identified certain structural similarities and possible indirect influences between the movements.

### Frankism

Jacob Frank (1726-1791) later claimed to be Sabbatai's reincarnation and developed an even more radical antinomian movement, culminating in mass conversions to Christianity.

### Reform Judaism

Some historians suggest that the disillusionment following the Sabbatean crisis indirectly contributed to the later development of Reform Judaism as Jews sought new approaches to their tradition.

### Modern Scholarship

Gershom Scholem and other modern scholars have rehabilitated the study of Sabbateanism as a significant historical phenomenon rather than merely a bizarre aberration.
