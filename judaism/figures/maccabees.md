![Maccabean revolt illustration](maccabean_revolt.jpg)

The Maccabees were a Jewish family who led a successful rebellion against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE, restoring Jewish religious freedom and establishing the Hasmonean dynasty. Their story represents one of Judaism's most significant historical examples of resistance against religious persecution and cultural assimilation.

## Key Figures of the Maccabean Family

- **Mattathias ben Johanan**: Patriarch of the family who initiated the revolt
- **Judah Maccabee**: Third son of Mattathias and primary military leader
- **Jonathan Apphus**: Succeeded Judah as leader
- **Simon Thassi**: Last surviving son who achieved Jewish independence
- **John Hyrcanus**: Son of Simon who expanded the Hasmonean kingdom
- **Other brothers**: John Gaddi and Eleazar Avaran (died during the rebellion)

## Historical Context

### Hellenistic Dominance

The Maccabean Revolt emerged during a period of intense Hellenization across the Near East. Following Alexander the Great's conquests, Greek culture, language, and religious practices spread throughout the region. After Alexander's death, his empire was divided, with the Seleucid Empire eventually controlling Judea.

### Antiochus IV Epiphanes

The revolt was triggered by the policies of Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164 BCE), who:
- Banned Jewish religious practices
- Prohibited Torah study
- Outlawed circumcision
- Desecrated the Temple in Jerusalem by installing a statue of Zeus
- Forced Jews to participate in pagan rituals

### Internal Division

The Jewish community itself was divided between:
- Hellenized Jews who embraced Greek culture and accommodation
- Traditionalists who advocated strict adherence to Jewish law
- Various factions with different approaches to resistance or accommodation

## The Maccabean Revolt (167-160 BCE)

### Outbreak of Rebellion

The revolt began in the village of Modiin when Mattathias, an elderly priest, refused to perform a sacrifice to Greek gods demanded by Seleucid officials. When another Jew stepped forward to comply, Mattathias killed both the Jew and the official, declaring: "Let everyone who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come with me" (1 Maccabees 2:27).

### Military Campaigns

After Mattathias's death, leadership passed to his son Judah, who:
- Developed effective guerrilla warfare tactics
- Won multiple victories against larger Seleucid forces
- Retook Jerusalem in 164 BCE
- Cleansed and rededicated the Temple (origin of Hanukkah)
- Continued campaigns to protect Jewish communities

### Leadership Succession

Following Judah's death in battle (160 BCE):
- Jonathan became leader, combining military and political strategies
- Simon succeeded Jonathan, finally achieving independence
- The Hasmonean dynasty was established, lasting until 63 BCE

## Religious and Cultural Significance

### Hanukkah Connection

The Maccabean victory and Temple rededication is commemorated in the festival of Hanukkah. According to tradition, when the Temple was reclaimed, only one day's supply of ritually pure oil for the menorah was found, but it miraculously lasted for eight days until new oil could be prepared.
