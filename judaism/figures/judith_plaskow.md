## Biography

### Early Life and Education

Judith Plaskow was born in 1947 in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in a middle-class, Conservative Jewish household. She grew up with strong Jewish identification, attending Hebrew school and participating in Jewish youth groups, while also receiving a solid secular education.

Her academic journey led her to Clark University, where she earned her bachelor's degree in 1968. She then pursued graduate studies at Yale University, receiving her M.A. in 1970 and Ph.D. in Religious Studies in 1975. Her dissertation, which later became her first book, *Sex, Sin, and Grace: Women's Experience and the Theologies of Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich* (1980), examined Christian theological concepts through a feminist lens—an approach she would later apply to Judaism.

While at Yale, Plaskow experienced the emerging second-wave feminist movement and began to recognize the tensions between her feminist consciousness and her Jewish identity. This tension would become productive ground for her life's work: developing a feminist theology of Judaism.

### Academic Career and Activism

After completing her doctorate, Plaskow taught at several institutions including Wichita State University and Manhattan College, where she was a professor of Religious Studies from 1979 until her retirement in 2012. At Manhattan College, a Roman Catholic institution, she was the first Jewish woman to receive tenure in the Religious Studies department.

In 1983, Plaskow co-founded the Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion with Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza, creating a crucial scholarly venue for feminist theological work across religious traditions. She served as co-editor for many years, helping to establish feminist scholarship as a legitimate and vital field within religious studies.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Plaskow was active in the feminist movement, participating in consciousness-raising groups and working to bridge her feminist and Jewish identities. She was a founding member of B'not Esh ("Daughters of Fire"), a Jewish feminist spiritual community that met annually for ritual, study, and fellowship, providing a laboratory for developing feminist Jewish practices and theology.

### Major Publications and Influence

Plaskow's landmark book, *Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective* (1990), represented the first comprehensive feminist theology of Judaism. The book challenged traditional Jewish theology by addressing the systematic exclusion of women from Jewish religious language, law, and leadership, and by proposing feminist reconstructions of key aspects of Jewish tradition.

Her subsequent work has explored Jewish feminist ethics, sexuality, and the body in Jewish religious thought, as well as the relationship between Judaism and feminist conceptions of the divine. In addition to her solo work, Plaskow has collaborated with Christian feminist theologian Carol P. Christ on several projects, including co-editing *Womanspirit Rising* (1979) and *Weaving the Visions* (1989), anthologies that helped define the field of feminist theology across religious traditions.

In recent years, Plaskow has increasingly addressed issues of Jewish identity, religious pluralism, and the relationships between religious communities, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

## Theological Contributions

### Feminist Critique of Judaism

Plaskow's theological work begins with a fundamental feminist critique of traditional Judaism as patriarchal in its core expressions. She argues that women have been systematically excluded from three crucial domains:

1. **Torah**: Women have been marginalized from the process of Torah interpretation and creation, leaving male experience as normative in Jewish religious texts.

2. **Community**: Women have been defined primarily through their relationships to men in Jewish law and practice, and excluded from full participation in religious communal life.

3. **God**: Traditional Jewish God-language is predominantly male, reinforcing hierarchical gender relationships and limiting conceptions of the divine.

Rather than rejecting Judaism in response to these critiques, Plaskow advocates remaining within the tradition while transforming it through feminist reinterpretation and reconstruction.

### Re-envisioning Torah

Plaskow expands the concept of Torah beyond written and oral law to include women's experiences and interpretations. She argues that feminist re-readings of traditional texts and the creation of new midrash (interpretive stories) that center women's voices are legitimate forms of Torah.

She advocates recovering silenced female voices in traditional texts and examining the gaps and silences where women's experiences have been omitted. This process involves not just adding women to existing frameworks but fundamentally reconceiving Jewish textual tradition to incorporate women's perspectives and experiences.

### Reconstructing Jewish Community

Plaskow challenges the traditional Jewish legal structure (halakhah) that defines women primarily in relation to men and restricts their participation in communal religious life. She argues for a community in which women have equal access to ritual roles and leadership positions, and in which women's experiences shape communal norms and practices.

She has been particularly concerned with issues of sexuality and the body in Jewish communal life, critiquing traditional attitudes toward menstruation, marriage, and homosexuality. Her work helped establish theoretical foundations for the full inclusion of LGBTQ Jews in religious communities.

### Reimagining God

Plaskow's theological work includes a thorough critique of exclusively masculine God-language in Judaism and an exploration of alternative ways of speaking about the divine. While maintaining Judaism's commitment to monotheism, she proposes more inclusive metaphors and language that reflect women's experiences and ecological awareness.

Rather than simply feminizing God-language (referring to God as "She"), Plaskow suggests more fundamental reconceptions of divinity that move beyond gendered hierarchical metaphors altogether. She has explored metaphors of God as source, wellspring, or encompassing presence—images that express divine immanence within the world rather than transcendent power over it.

## Methodological Approaches

### Experience as Theological Source

Central to Plaskow's methodology is the validation of women's experience as a legitimate source for theological reflection. Drawing on feminist theory, she argues that women's lived experiences of both oppression and liberation provide essential insights for reconstructing religious tradition.

This emphasis on experience challenges traditional Jewish (and broader religious) tendencies to privilege text and tradition as the primary sources of religious authority. Plaskow does not reject these traditional sources but insists that they must be placed in conversation with women's experiences.

### Constructive Theology

Plaskow's approach is not merely critical but constructive. She works to build new theological frameworks that maintain continuity with Jewish tradition while fundamentally transforming it to reflect feminist values and women's experiences.

This constructive approach involves both reinterpreting existing concepts and practices and creating new ones. For example, her work on midrash doesn't simply critique existing interpretations but actively creates new stories and interpretations that center women's experiences and perspectives.

### Inter-religious Dialogue

Throughout her career, Plaskow has engaged in substantive dialogue with feminist theologians from other religious traditions, particularly Christianity. Her collaborations with Christian theologian Carol P. Christ exemplify this approach, exploring commonalities and differences in feminist theological methods across religious boundaries.

This inter-religious approach has enriched her Jewish feminist theology by introducing comparative perspectives and methodological insights, while maintaining the particularity of Jewish theological concerns and categories.

## Impact and Influence

### Academic Influence

Plaskow's work has profoundly influenced the field of religious studies, helping to establish feminist theology as a legitimate academic discipline. Her methodological innovations—particularly her emphasis on experience as a theological source and her constructive approach to tradition—have been adopted by scholars working in various religious traditions.

Within Jewish studies specifically, she helped create space for feminist scholarship that is now a vital part of the field. Generations of Jewish feminist scholars have built upon her foundational work, extending her insights into areas such as biblical interpretation, rabbinic literature, liturgy, and contemporary Jewish practice.

### Religious Practice and Reform

Beyond academia, Plaskow's theological work has had tangible effects on religious communities, particularly within Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative Judaism. Her critiques and constructive proposals have influenced liturgical reform, expansion of women's ritual roles, and reconceptualization of communal structures.

Elements of Plaskow's feminist theology have been integrated into rabbinical school curricula, influencing the training of religious leaders across denominations. Her work has provided theological justification for progressive changes in areas including gender-inclusive language, women's leadership, and LGBTQ inclusion.

### Broader Feminist Movement

Within the broader feminist movement, Plaskow has been an important voice articulating the value of engaging with religious traditions rather than dismissing them as irredeemably patriarchal. Her work demonstrates how feminist critique can transform rather than reject religious heritage, offering a model for feminist engagement with tradition that honors both critique and continuity.

## Key Themes in Her Work

### Embodiment and Sexuality

A central theme in Plaskow's work is reclaiming the body and sexuality as sites of holiness rather than shame in Jewish tradition. She critiques the tendency in traditional Judaism (and Western religion generally) to associate women with the body and sexuality in negative ways.

Her essay "The Coming of Lilith," a feminist midrash on the creation story, exemplifies this approach by reimagining the relationship between Eve and Lilith (Adam's mythical first wife in rabbinic legend) as one of solidarity rather than competition. This reinterpretation challenges traditional narratives about female sexuality and offers new possibilities for understanding embodiment.

### Memory and History

Plaskow emphasizes the importance of recovering women's histories and creating feminist memory within Judaism. She argues that women have been largely written out of Jewish historical narratives, and that recovering and creating these narratives is essential for women's full inclusion in the tradition.

This recovery project involves both historical research to uncover women's actual roles in Jewish history and creative reinterpretation to imagine women's voices and experiences where historical records are silent.

### Justice and Ethics

Throughout her work, Plaskow connects feminist theology to broader issues of social justice. She argues that feminist transformation of Judaism must address not only gender inequality but all forms of oppression, including racism, economic injustice, homophobia, and ecological destruction.

In recent years, she has particularly emphasized the connections between feminist theology and Jewish responses to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, arguing for an approach that honors both Jewish security concerns and Palestinian rights.

### Religious Pluralism

Plaskow has explored questions of religious diversity and the relationship between religious communities, particularly in the context of increasing global interconnection. She advocates approaches to religious pluralism that respect the integrity of different traditions while enabling meaningful dialogue and cooperation.

## Contemporary Relevance

Plaskow's work remains highly relevant to contemporary discussions of gender in religious contexts. As religious communities continue to grapple with questions of women's leadership, LGBTQ inclusion, and gender-inclusive language, her theoretical frameworks provide valuable resources for navigating these issues.

Her emphasis on the body and sexuality speaks to ongoing religious debates about reproductive rights, sexual ethics, and gender identity. Her insistence that these issues be addressed through both critical and constructive theological engagement offers an alternative to both uncritical traditionalism and complete rejection of religious frameworks.

As interreligious dialogue becomes increasingly important in a pluralistic world, Plaskow's model of feminist theological exchange across religious boundaries provides a methodology for respectful engagement that acknowledges both commonalities and differences.
