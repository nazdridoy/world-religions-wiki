![Conservative movement service](conservative_synagogue.jpg)

Conservative Judaism emerged in the 19th century as a middle path between Orthodox traditionalism and Reform innovation. Its leaders have shaped a movement that maintains fidelity to Jewish law and tradition while engaging with modernity, academic scholarship, and changing social conditions. This approach has created a distinctive religious identity that has significantly influenced American and global Jewish life.
