- He subsequently wrote an 800-page memoir in Yiddish titled "Un di velt hot geshvign" ("And the World Remained Silent")
- A greatly condensed French version was published as "La Nuit" in 1958
- The English translation, "Night," was published in 1960 and eventually became a literary classic

- Called attention to the plight of Palestinian refugees while condemning terrorism
- Famously declared: "I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation"

## Philosophical and Religious Thought

### Theological Wrestling

Wiesel's work explores profound theological questions arising from the Holocaust:
- The question of God's silence during the Holocaust: "Where was God at Auschwitz?"
- The continuation of Jewish faith after unprecedented catastrophe
- The problem of evil and human responsibility
- The paradox of maintaining faith while questioning God
- The mystery of Jewish survival and continuity

In "Night," he writes about a pivotal moment during a hanging at Auschwitz:
"Behind me, I heard the same man asking: 'Where is God now?' And I heard a voice within me answer him: 'Where is He? Here He is—He is hanging here on this gallows.'"

### Ethics and Memory

His ethical philosophy centered on:
- The moral obligation to remember ("To forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time")
- The danger of indifference ("The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference")
- The necessity of taking sides ("Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim")
- The importance of action ("There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest")
- The connection between memory and justice

### Literary Techniques and Themes

Wiesel's writing is characterized by:
- Spare, restrained prose that conveys horror through understatement
- Use of paradox and questions rather than definitive answers
- Exploration of night as both literal setting and metaphor
- Emphasis on the witness as a sacred role
- The inadequacy of language to fully express the Holocaust experience
- Narrative as a form of resistance against oblivion

## Legacy and Impact

In 1986, Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize:
- The Norwegian Nobel Committee called him a "messenger to mankind"
