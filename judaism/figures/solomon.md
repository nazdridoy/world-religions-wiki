## Biblical Narrative

### Ascension to the Throne

Solomon's path to kingship was complicated by succession struggles. As David neared death, another son, Adonijah, attempted to claim the throne. Bathsheba and the prophet Nathan intervened, reminding David of his promise that Solomon would be king. David confirmed Solomon as his successor, and the young prince was anointed king while his father still lived.

According to 1 Kings 3, at the beginning of his reign, God appeared to Solomon in a dream at Gibeon and offered to grant him anything he wished. Instead of requesting wealth or long life, Solomon asked for "an understanding heart to judge Your people, to distinguish between good and evil." Pleased with this request, God granted Solomon unparalleled wisdom, as well as wealth and honor.

### Building of the Temple

Solomon's greatest physical achievement was the construction of the First Temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling his father David's dream. The Temple took seven years to build and featured:
- The Holy of Holies (Kodesh HaKodashim) containing the Ark of the Covenant
- The main sanctuary (Heikhal) with the menorah and altar of incense
- The outer courtyard with the large bronze basin and altar for sacrifices
- Elaborate decorations of gold, cedar, and precious materials

The dedication of the Temple, described in 1 Kings 8, included sacrifices, Solomon's blessing of the people, and his eloquent prayer acknowledging that no earthly structure could truly house God.

### Wisdom and Justice

Solomon's wisdom became legendary throughout the ancient world. The most famous illustration is his judgment in the case of two women claiming the same baby. When he threatened to cut the infant in half, the real mother revealed herself by preferring to give up the child rather than see it killed, demonstrating Solomon's psychological insight.

1 Kings states that "Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt" (4:30). People from all nations came to hear his wisdom, and he was said to have composed 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs.

### Prosperity and Administration

Under Solomon's rule, Israel experienced unprecedented prosperity and international prestige:
- He established trading partnerships with neighboring kingdoms
- Developed copper mines and extensive building projects
- Created a sophisticated administrative system with twelve districts
- Maintained a powerful army with chariots and horsemen
- Built a merchant fleet based at Ezion-Geber on the Red Sea

### Downfall and Division

Despite his wisdom, Solomon's later years were marked by moral and political decline. The Bible attributes this to his many foreign wives who "turned his heart after other gods" (1 Kings 11:4). He built high places for foreign deities, incurring divine displeasure.

Solomon's extensive building projects and lavish court required heavy taxation and forced labor, creating discontent among the people. After his death, when his son Rehoboam refused to lighten these burdens, the northern tribes seceded, dividing the kingdom.
