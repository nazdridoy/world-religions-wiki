## Life and Background

### Early Years and Education

Born in Jerusalem in 1937 to secular parents, Steinsaltz received both religious and secular education. He studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry at the Hebrew University while simultaneously deepening his Jewish knowledge. At age 24, he became the youngest school principal in Israel.

His extraordinary abilities were recognized earlyâ€”he possessed photographic memory, mastery of multiple languages, and a rare capacity to synthesize diverse fields of knowledge. Though he came from a secular background, he embraced religious practice and study in his teens, studying under the guidance of Rabbi Shmuel Elazar Heilprin.

### Teaching and Leadership

In 1965, Steinsaltz began his lifelong project of translating the Talmud, first into Modern Hebrew and later into English and other languages. He founded the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications and established numerous educational institutions, including yeshivot and schools that combined religious and secular studies.

During the Soviet era, he worked secretly to support Jewish education in the USSR, helping to establish Jewish educational networks after the fall of communism. In 1989, he was appointed to head a revived Sanhedrin, an attempt to restore the ancient Jewish high court.

### Later Years

In 2012, Steinsaltz completed his Hebrew translation and commentary of the entire Babylonian Talmud after 45 years of work. Despite suffering a stroke in 2016, he continued his scholarly work until his death in Jerusalem in 2020.

- Illustrations, diagrams, and background information
- Historical and scientific context

The work has been translated into English, French, Russian, and Spanish, making the Talmud accessible to those without extensive yeshiva education. This project democratized Talmud study and is considered one of the most important Jewish scholarly achievements of the 20th century.
