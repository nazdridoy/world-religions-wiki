## Biography

### Early Life and Education

Blu (née Genauer) Greenberg was born in 1936 in Seattle, Washington, to an Orthodox Jewish family. She grew up in a religiously observant home that also valued secular education. After her early education, she earned a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College, a master's degree in clinical psychology from City University of New York, and a master's degree in Jewish studies from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America—a remarkable educational achievement for an Orthodox woman of her generation.

Her decision to study at the Conservative movement's Jewish Theological Seminary while maintaining her Orthodox identity foreshadowed her later work building bridges between tradition and change. During her formative years, Greenberg developed both a deep commitment to Orthodox observance and an awareness of gender inequality within traditional Jewish structures.

### Marriage and Family Life

In 1957, Blu married Rabbi Irving "Yitz" Greenberg, who would become a prominent modern Orthodox rabbi, theologian, and leader of the Riverdale Jewish Center in New York. Their partnership has been both personal and intellectual, with both spouses engaging in theological writing and community leadership while raising their five children in an observant Jewish home.

The Greenbergs' household became a model for the integration of Orthodox practice, intellectual engagement with both Jewish and secular thought, and openness to addressing contemporary social issues. Blu Greenberg's 1983 book, *How to Run a Traditional Jewish Household*, drew on this experience to create a practical guide that combined traditional observance with modern sensibilities.

### Feminist Awakening

Greenberg's formal involvement with feminism began in 1973 when she participated in the First National Jewish Women's Conference, where she encountered Jewish women from various denominations discussing gender issues within Judaism. This experience was transformative, leading her to apply feminist analysis to Orthodox practice while maintaining her commitment to halakhah.

In contrast to some feminists who saw traditional religion as inherently oppressive, Greenberg believed that Orthodox Judaism contained internal resources for addressing gender inequality. She developed her distinctive approach, insisting that feminism and halakhah could be reconciled through careful interpretation and application of Jewish legal principles.

### Leadership and Activism

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Greenberg became increasingly prominent as a voice for Orthodox feminism. Her 1981 book *On Women and Judaism: A View from Tradition* articulated a vision for expanding women's roles within the boundaries of halakhah and provided intellectual foundations for the Orthodox feminist movement.

In 1997, Greenberg founded the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance (JOFA), which has become the institutional center of Orthodox feminism. Under her leadership, JOFA has advocated for women's Torah study, prayer groups, leadership roles in synagogues and schools, and solutions to issues like agunah (women unable to obtain religious divorces).

Beyond her work in Orthodox feminism, Greenberg has been active in interfaith dialogue, Holocaust remembrance, and efforts to prevent genocide. She has served on numerous boards and commissions, including the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council and the International Council of the Museum of Jewish Heritage.

## Theological and Philosophical Contributions

### Orthodox Feminist Methodology

Greenberg developed a distinctive methodology for addressing gender issues within Orthodox Judaism. Unlike approaches that reject halakhic authority or view tradition as immutable, she advocates working within the halakhic system to find solutions to gender inequities. Her often-quoted principle, "Where there is a rabbinic will, there is a halakhic way," expresses her conviction that Jewish law has flexibility to address contemporary concerns when religious authorities are motivated to do so.

This approach acknowledges tensions between feminism and traditional Judaism but refuses to see them as irreconcilable. Instead, Greenberg engages in careful analysis of halakhic sources to identify precedents and principles that could support expanded roles for women. She distinguishes between biblical commandments (which she views as binding) and rabbinical enactments or customs (which she sees as more amenable to reinterpretation).

### Halakhic Process and Change

Greenberg's work emphasizes the historical dynamism of halakhah. She argues that Jewish law has always evolved in response to changing social conditions, and that contemporary gender equality represents a legitimate concern that the halakhic process should address.

She points to historical precedents of legal change, such as the rabbinic enactment of the prozbul (which circumvented biblical laws of debt release), the betterment of women's status through the takkanot (enactments) of Rabbeinu Gershom in the Middle Ages, and more recent accommodations for modern economic and technological realities. These examples demonstrate that halakhic flexibility has precedent when important values are at stake.

Unlike more radical approaches, Greenberg does not advocate individual autonomy in halakhic decision-making. Instead, she calls for rabbinical authorities to exercise their legitimate power to interpret and apply Jewish law in ways that address women's concerns while maintaining halakhic integrity.

### Theological Anthropology

Greenberg challenges interpretations of Jewish sources that characterize women as spiritually inferior or naturally subordinate to men. She rejects the notion that gender hierarchy is an essential feature of Judaism, arguing instead that the Torah's foundational teaching that all humans are created in God's image (Genesis 1:27) establishes the fundamental equality of men and women.

While acknowledging biological differences between sexes, she distinguishes between biological facts and social constructions of gender roles. She argues that many limitations on women in traditional Judaism reflect historical social arrangements rather than immutable divine commandments, making them candidates for reinterpretation in light of contemporary understandings of human equality.

## Major Contributions and Initiatives

### Women's Prayer Groups

Greenberg has been a strong advocate for women's prayer groups (tefillah groups) within Orthodoxy. These groups allow women to lead prayers for other women, read from the Torah, and participate more actively in liturgical life, while navigating halakhic concerns by not constituting a formal minyan (prayer quorum) that would require men's presence.

Through her leadership in JOFA, Greenberg has helped establish parameters for these groups that maintain their Orthodox character while maximizing women's participation. These groups have become important spiritual and educational spaces for Orthodox women seeking greater involvement in communal prayer.

### Torah Study for Women

Expanding women's access to Torah study has been central to Greenberg's agenda. She has supported the development of advanced Jewish learning institutions for women, including Drisha Institute in New York and various women's yeshivot in Israel. She argues that women's Torah education is essential both for their spiritual development and for developing female leadership in the Orthodox community.

Greenberg has particularly highlighted the importance of women studying Talmud and halakhah, areas traditionally reserved for men. She maintains that women's perspectives on these texts can enrich Jewish legal discourse and help address gender inequities from within the tradition.

### Addressing the Agunah Problem

One of Greenberg's most significant contributions has been her persistent advocacy for solutions to the agunah problem—the situation of women who cannot remarry because their husbands refuse to grant them a religious divorce (get). She helped establish the Task Force on Jewish Divorce to address this issue.

Rather than rejecting the traditional requirement for a husband's consent in divorce, Greenberg has worked within the halakhic framework to develop solutions such as prenuptial agreements that create financial disincentives for recalcitrant husbands. This approach exemplifies her commitment to finding solutions that respect both halakhic constraints and women's autonomy.

### Female Religious Leadership

Greenberg has supported the development of new religious leadership roles for Orthodox women, including congregational interns, scholars-in-residence, and halakhic advisors on women's issues. While not advocating for women serving as rabbis in the same capacity as men, she has worked to expand leadership opportunities within Orthodox parameters.

She has encouraged the certification of women as yoatzot halakhah (advisors on Jewish law, particularly related to family purity), creating a professional role in which women's expertise is formally recognized and utilized in the Orthodox community.

## Impact and Influence

### Institutional Development

Through founding JOFA, Greenberg created an organizational infrastructure for Orthodox feminism. The organization's conferences, publications, and advocacy have provided resources and community for those seeking to expand women's roles while maintaining Orthodox observance. This institutional framework has been crucial for translating theoretical ideas into practical changes in Orthodox communities.

JOFA's approach under Greenberg's leadership has been characterized by working incrementally within the system rather than making radical demands. This strategy has allowed for gradual acceptance of feminist innovations in communities that might otherwise reject them outright.

### Educational Changes

Greenberg's advocacy has contributed to dramatic changes in women's Jewish education. When she began her work, advanced Torah study for women was rare in Orthodox settings; today, institutions offering high-level Jewish learning for women exist throughout the world, and women's Talmud study has become normalized in many Modern Orthodox communities.

The expansion of women's Jewish knowledge has created a cadre of highly educated Orthodox women who can participate in religious discourse and leadership in unprecedented ways. This educational transformation may ultimately prove Greenberg's most enduring legacy.

### Liturgical Innovations

Orthodox women's prayer groups, which Greenberg helped legitimize, have created space for women to develop liturgical leadership skills and experience aspects of Jewish worship previously unavailable to them. While maintaining separation from men's prayer quorums, these groups have enabled women to read from the Torah, lead certain prayers, and celebrate lifecycle events in more participatory ways.

These prayer innovations have been particularly significant because they demonstrate that increased women's participation is possible without abandoning Orthodox principles of gender separation in worship.

### Halakhic Discourse

Perhaps most significantly, Greenberg has helped legitimize the application of feminist analysis to halakhic issues. By insisting that gender equality is a legitimate value that should inform halakhic reasoning—rather than an external imposition on Jewish law—she has helped create space for addressing women's concerns within Orthodox legal discourse.

Her work has influenced a generation of Orthodox rabbis, scholars, and community leaders who increasingly recognize gender issues as worthy of serious halakhic consideration, even when they may not adopt her specific conclusions.

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Conservative Critiques

More traditional elements within Orthodoxy have criticized Greenberg for introducing feminist values that they view as foreign to authentic Judaism. Some traditionalists argue that her approach subordinates halakhah to contemporary secular values and undermines rabbinic authority. They object particularly to innovations in women's ritual participation that they see as blurring essential gender distinctions in Jewish practice.

Some Orthodox critics question whether the changes Greenberg advocates can be contained within Orthodox boundaries or will inevitably lead to more radical departures from tradition. They suggest that Orthodox feminism represents a slippery slope toward Conservative or Reform approaches to Jewish law.

### Feminist Critiques

From a different perspective, some non-Orthodox Jewish feminists have criticized Greenberg's approach as too limited. They argue that her commitment to working within halakhic parameters constrains her ability to address the most fundamental aspects of gender inequality in Judaism. Some suggest that her "where there is a rabbinic will" formulation places too much faith in rabbinic authorities who have historically been resistant to feminist concerns.

These critics question whether meaningful gender equality is possible within a system that maintains separate gender roles and reserves certain religious privileges for men. They suggest that more radical approaches to Jewish feminism may be necessary to achieve full equality.

### Responses and Position

Greenberg has generally responded to these criticisms by maintaining her middle position and emphasizing the importance of both feminist and Orthodox commitments. She acknowledges tensions between these values but insists that creative engagement with tradition can address many inequities without abandoning Orthodox principles.

She has argued that working within the system, despite its limitations, can achieve meaningful change over time. At the same time, she has occasionally criticized Orthodox leadership for insufficient "rabbinic will" to address women's concerns, particularly regarding the agunah problem.

## Personal Qualities and Leadership Style

### Bridge-Building Approach

Throughout her career, Greenberg has been known for her ability to communicate across ideological divides. Her personal warmth, respect for diverse perspectives, and willingness to engage in dialogue have enabled her to maintain relationships with both traditional Orthodox leaders and non-Orthodox feminists, despite significant disagreements.

This bridge-building capacity has been crucial to her effectiveness. By remaining within the Orthodox community while advocating for change, she has been able to influence the community from within rather than being marginalized as an outside critic.

### Integration of Feminism and Observance

In her personal life, Greenberg has modeled the integration of feminist consciousness with Orthodox observance. Her own religious practice demonstrates that commitment to halakhah does not require accepting all traditional gender arrangements. This lived example of Orthodox feminism has inspired others to pursue similar integration in their own lives.

### Intellectual and Spiritual Synthesis

Greenberg's work is characterized by a remarkable synthesis of traditional Jewish learning, modern academic scholarship, feminist theory, and personal religious commitment. Her writing brings these diverse elements together in a coherent approach that respects both tradition and contemporary ethical insights.

This integrative quality reflects her lifelong commitment to reconciling seemingly contradictory values and finding paths forward that honor multiple commitments rather than forcing binary choices.
