## Biblical Narrative

### Early Life and Rise to Prominence

David first appears in the biblical narrative as the youngest son of Jesse from Bethlehem in Judah. When the prophet Samuel, following divine guidance, sought to anoint a new king to replace the failing Saul, he was led to Jesse's home where he passed over the seven elder sons to anoint the shepherd boy David.

David's rise to public prominence came through his confrontation with the Philistine champion Goliath. Armed only with a sling, five stones, and faith in God, the young David defeated the heavily armored giant, demonstrating that divine favor trumps physical might. This victory brought him into King Saul's service, where he formed a close friendship with Saul's son Jonathan but eventually incurred the king's jealousy due to his growing popularity and military successes.

### Years as a Fugitive

As Saul's jealousy escalated into murderous rage, David was forced to flee the court and spend years as a fugitive. During this period, he:
- Gathered a band of loyal followers and outcasts
- Twice spared Saul's life when given opportunities to kill him
- Lived among the Philistines for protection
- Married several wives including Abigail, a woman noted for her wisdom
- Composed many psalms reflecting his experiences of persecution and faith

### Kingship

After Saul's death in battle against the Philistines, David was anointed king over his tribe of Judah, ruling from Hebron for seven years. Following a period of civil war with supporters of Saul's son Ishbosheth, David was finally recognized as king over all Israel.

Key achievements of his reign included:

- **Unification**: Bringing the northern and southern tribes together under one crown
- **Jerusalem**: Conquering the Jebusite city and establishing it as his capital
- **Military Success**: Defeating Israel's enemies and expanding the kingdom's boundaries
- **Administration**: Setting up an effective governmental structure
- **Religious Centralization**: Bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem and preparing for the Temple
- **Cultural Contributions**: Composing psalms and instituting Temple music

### Moral Failures and Consequences

The biblical narrative presents David as deeply human, capable of grave moral failures. His most significant transgression involved taking Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, and arranging for Uriah's death in battle to cover up his adultery. The prophet Nathan confronted David with this sin, leading to the king's repentance but also to lasting consequences including internal family turmoil.

### Later Life and Succession

David's later years were marked by family troubles, including:
- The rape of his daughter Tamar by her half-brother Amnon
- The rebellion and death of his son Absalom
- Succession disputes between his sons
- A plague that struck Israel after a census that David ordered

Before his death, David designated his son Solomon as heir, passing to him the responsibility of building the Temple for which David had made extensive preparations but was forbidden to build himself due to the blood he had shed in warfare.

## Religious and Historical Significance
