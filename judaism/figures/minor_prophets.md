These prophets demonstrate that true covenant fidelity requires social righteousness, not merely ritual observance.

### The Day of the LORD

- Initially presented as a day of darkness and judgment
- Later developed to include restoration and blessing after judgment
- Applied to historical events (Assyrian/Babylonian conquests)
- Extended to eschatological expectations
- Characterized by cosmic upheaval and divine presence

Despite severe pronouncements of judgment, the Minor Prophets consistently affirm divine mercy:
