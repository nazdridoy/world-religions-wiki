# Emmanuel Levinas - Ethics as First Philosophy

![Emmanuel Levinas portrait](levinas_portrait.jpg)

Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995) was one of the most significant philosophical and Jewish thinkers of the 20th century. His work fundamentally transformed continental philosophy by prioritizing ethics over ontology, articulating a profound philosophy of responsibility based on the encounter with the Other. His unique integration of Talmudic thought with phenomenology created a distinctive approach to ethics that continues to influence philosophy, Jewish thought, and interfaith dialogue.

## Life and Background

### Early Years and Education

Emmanuel Levinas was born in 1906 in Kaunas, Lithuania, to a traditional Jewish family. Growing up, he received both a traditional Jewish education and exposure to Russian literature, which remained influential throughout his life. The Russian Revolution of 1917 forced his family to flee to Ukraine before eventually settling in France in 1923.

Levinas began his philosophical studies at the University of Strasbourg, where he encountered thinkers who would profoundly shape his intellectual development. In 1928-1929, he studied phenomenology with Edmund Husserl in Freiburg, Germany, where he also encountered Martin Heidegger, whose philosophy initially impressed him deeply before Heidegger's later Nazi affiliations led to a critical reassessment.

### War Experience and Philosophical Development

The Nazi rise to power and World War II marked a crucial turning point in Levinas's life and thought. As a naturalized French citizen, he served in the French army and was captured in 1940. Levinas spent five years as a prisoner of war in a labor camp for Jewish POWs. While his immediate family in France survived through his wife's concealment in a monastery, almost all his Lithuanian family was murdered in the Holocaust.

This experience profoundly shaped his philosophical outlook, intensifying his critique of Western philosophy's preoccupation with ontology and being, which he saw as having failed to prevent totalitarianism. In the camps, he began conceptualizing the philosophical approach that would define his work—an ethics based on responsibility to the Other that precedes questions of being.

### Academic Career and Leadership

After the war, Levinas began his formal philosophical career, receiving his doctorate from the University of Sorbonne in 1961 with a dissertation that would become "Totality and Infinity." He taught at the Alliance Israélite Universelle, the University of Poitiers, and finally at the Sorbonne until his retirement in 1976.

Simultaneously, Levinas became a major figure in French Jewish intellectual life. From 1957 to 1973, he directed the École Normale Israélite Orientale, a school training teachers for the Alliance's Jewish schools. He also became known for his Talmudic readings at the Colloque des Intellectuels Juifs de Langue Française (Colloquium of French-Speaking Jewish Intellectuals).

He continued writing and publishing until his death in Paris in 1995, leaving behind a body of work that transformed both philosophy and Jewish thought.

## Major Philosophical Contributions

### Ethics as First Philosophy

Levinas's most revolutionary contribution was his inversion of the traditional philosophical hierarchy that placed ontology (the study of being) as the foundation of philosophy. Instead, he argued that ethics precedes ontology—our responsibility to others is more fundamental than questions about existence. 

Key aspects of this approach include:

- **Critique of Totality**: Rejection of philosophical systems that reduce reality to a comprehensive whole
- **Infinity versus Totality**: Contrasting closed systems with the infinite ethical demand
- **Beyond Ontology**: Moving past Heidegger's focus on Being to the ethical relationship
- **Pre-Rational Ethics**: Ethics not based on rationality but on the pre-cognitive encounter with alterity

This perspective challenged the predominant Western philosophical tradition and offered an alternative grounding for ethics not based on rationality, utility, or universal principles.

### The Face and the Other

Central to Levinas's ethics is the concept of "the face" (le visage) and the encounter with "the Other" (l'Autrui). For Levinas, when we encounter another person face-to-face, we experience an ethical demand that precedes any conceptualization or categorization:

- **The Face**: Not merely physical features but the manifestation of vulnerability and transcendence
- **Ethical Command**: The face commands "Thou shalt not kill" and demands response
- **Asymmetrical Responsibility**: My responsibility to the Other is infinite and non-reciprocal
- **Ethical Substitution**: Taking responsibility even for the Other's responsibility
- **Third Party**: How the ethical dyad extends to all humanity

This face-to-face encounter establishes an ethical relationship that cannot be reduced to knowledge, comprehension, or reciprocity. The Other remains infinitely transcendent while placing an infinite demand on me.

### Critique of Western Philosophy

Levinas developed a profound critique of Western philosophical traditions:

- **Totalization**: Western philosophy's tendency to reduce otherness to sameness
- **Egology**: Critique of subject-centered philosophies from Descartes to Husserl
- **Ontological Violence**: How prioritizing being leads to violence against otherness
- **Enlightenment Limitations**: Critique of reason's inability to establish ethics
- **Technology and Instrumentality**: How modernity reduces others to instruments

He saw the Holocaust not as an aberration but as a terrible manifestation of tendencies inherent in Western thought that privileged comprehension, totality, and the reduction of otherness.

## Jewish Philosophical Contributions

### Talmudic Readings

Alongside his phenomenological work, Levinas developed a unique approach to Talmudic commentary, published in collections such as "Nine Talmudic Readings" and "Beyond the Verse." These commentaries:

- Applied philosophical methods to traditional Talmudic texts
- Revealed ethical insights in seemingly legal or narrative passages
- Connected ancient Jewish wisdom to contemporary ethical challenges
- Demonstrated the universality within Jewish particularity

His approach was neither orthodox nor reform, but a distinctive method that highlighted the ethical wisdom in the Talmudic tradition while engaging modern philosophical questions.

### Judaism and Universality

Levinas articulated a distinctive understanding of Judaism's role in universal ethics:

- **Ethical Monotheism**: One God means one humanity and universal responsibility
- **Particularity and Universality**: How Jewish particularity contains universal ethics
- **Difficult Freedom**: Judaism as ethical demand rather than comfort or privilege
- **Athens and Jerusalem**: Relationship between Greek philosophy and Jewish wisdom
- **Jewish Election**: Reinterpreting chosenness as ethical responsibility rather than privilege

For Levinas, Judaism's ethical core was not in opposition to universality but was its very source—the infinite responsibility to others that Judaism teaches is the foundation of ethics for everyone.

## Major Works

Levinas's corpus can be roughly divided into his philosophical works and his explicitly Jewish writings, though the themes overlap:

## Key Concepts and Terms

Levinas developed a distinctive philosophical vocabulary to express his ideas:

- **Il y a (there is)**: The impersonal, anonymous existence before subjectivity
- **Hypostasis**: The emergence of a subject from anonymous existence
- **Saying and Said**: The distinction between ethical expression and ontological content
- **Trace**: How transcendence manifests within immanence
- **Diachrony**: Time experienced through responsibility rather than synchronous presence
- **Proximity**: Ethical closeness beyond spatial relations
- **Hostage**: The subject held responsible by the Other's need
- **Illeity**: The third-person aspect of transcendence ("He-ness")

## Quotations

Some of Levinas's most notable statements include:

- "Ethics is first philosophy."
- "The face speaks to me and thereby invites me to a relation."
- "To be or not to be is probably not the primary question."
- "The Other concerns me despite myself."
- "My relationship with the Other as neighbor gives meaning to my relations with all others."
- "The ethical relationship is not grafted onto an antecedent natural relationship; it is not added to a previous nature."
- "Judaism is not a religion, it is an ethic."
- "Justice begins with the face."
