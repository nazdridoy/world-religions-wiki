# Daniel (Daniyel) - Prophet of the Exile

![Daniel in the lions' den](daniel_lions_den.jpg)

Daniel occupies a unique position among Jewish prophetic figures as both a court sage and an apocalyptic visionary during the Babylonian and Persian exiles. His extraordinary abilities to interpret dreams and visions, unflinching faithfulness to God despite persecution, and remarkable apocalyptic prophecies made him a powerful model of Jewish identity maintenance within foreign cultures and introduced influential concepts about messianic redemption and the end of days.

## Biblical Narrative

### Exile and Early Life

Daniel was among the elite young men of Judah taken to Babylon in the first deportation (ca. 605 BCE) during King Jehoiakim's reign. Selected for his intelligence and potential, he received three years of Babylonian education to serve in the royal court. Given the Babylonian name Belteshazzar, Daniel and his three friends (Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, renamed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego) immediately demonstrated their commitment to Jewish law by refusing to defile themselves with the king's food and wine, requesting vegetables and water instead.

### Rise to Prominence

Daniel's career spanned three empires:

1. **Under Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon**: Daniel gained prominence by interpreting the king's dream of a great statue representing four kingdoms, a feat no other wise men could accomplish. His interpretation brought him and his friends high positions in Babylon.

2. **Under Belshazzar of Babylon**: Years later, during Belshazzar's feast, Daniel interpreted the mysterious handwriting on the wall ("MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN"), predicting Babylon's fall to the Medes and Persians, which occurred that very night.

3. **Under Darius the Mede and Cyrus the Persian**: Daniel maintained his high position into the Persian administration, prompting jealousy from other officials who engineered his persecution through the famous lions' den incident, from which God miraculously delivered him.

### Visions and Prophecies

The second half of the Book of Daniel (chapters 7-12) records his remarkable apocalyptic visions:

1. **Four Beasts** (Chapter 7): Four beasts representing four empires, followed by the "Ancient of Days" giving dominion to "one like a son of man"

2. **Ram and Goat** (Chapter 8): Detailed prophecy about the conflict between the Medo-Persian and Greek empires

3. **Seventy Weeks** (Chapter 9): After Daniel's prayer of repentance on behalf of Israel, the angel Gabriel reveals a timetable for future events involving Jerusalem, the Messiah, and the Temple

4. **Final Vision** (Chapters 10-12): An extended revelation about future conflicts, particularly involving the Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms, the persecution under Antiochus IV Epiphanes, and ultimate redemption including resurrection

### Final Years

According to the biblical account, Daniel continued in the Persian administration into the reign of Cyrus. The Bible does not record his death, though tradition suggests he died in Susa, Persia, at an advanced age, having never returned to Jerusalem.

## Religious Significance

### In Jewish Theology

Daniel contributed several key theological concepts to Judaism:

- **Jewish Identity in Diaspora**: Demonstrated how to maintain Jewish faith and practice while functioning in a foreign society and culture
- **Resurrection Belief**: Presented one of the clearest early Jewish statements about bodily resurrection (12:2)
- **Developed Angelology**: Named specific angels (Gabriel, Michael) and described their roles and hierarchies
- **Messianic Timeline**: Introduced the concept of predetermined periods preceding the messianic age
- **Divine Sovereignty**: Emphasized God's ultimate control over human empires and history

### In Jewish Eschatology

Daniel profoundly influenced Jewish eschatological thought:
- His visions became foundational for apocalyptic literature
- His concept of world empires shaped understanding of history's progression
- His "son of man" vision influenced messianic expectations
- His numerical calculations (70 weeks, 1,290 days, etc.) inspired later apocalyptic time calculations
- His resurrection prophecy supported development of afterlife concepts

## Rabbinic and Midrashic Elaborations

The rabbis developed numerous traditions about Daniel:

- **Status as Prophet**: Debated whether Daniel should be considered a prophet, with some placing his writings in Ketuvim rather than Nevi'im
- **Survival Tactics**: Stories explaining how he survived the lions' den (angels sealed the lions' mouths)
- **Confrontation with Nebuchadnezzar**: Expanded accounts of Daniel rebuking the king's idolatry
- **Hidden Wisdom**: Traditions that Daniel concealed some of his knowledge due to its profound nature
- **Messianic Calculations**: Extensive speculation about the meaning of his time periods

## Daniel in Jewish Thought

Throughout Jewish intellectual history, Daniel has been interpreted variously:

- **Medieval Commentators**: Used Daniel's visions to understand Jewish history and persecution
- **Maimonides**: Examined Daniel's prophetic status and the nature of his visions
- **Kabbalistic Tradition**: Found mystical codes and cosmic structures in his number patterns
- **Hasidic Thought**: Emphasized his ability to maintain inner purity in an impure environment
- **Modern Scholarship**: Analyzed the historical context and development of the text

## Historical Perspectives

Modern scholarship has approached Daniel from various angles:
- Dating debate regarding final composition during the Maccabean period
- Archaeological confirmation of Babylonian court practices
- Historical analysis of the empires described in his visions
- Literary genre studies of apocalyptic literature
- Comparison with other Near Eastern dream interpretation traditions

## Daniel in Art and Culture

Daniel has been depicted extensively in Jewish and broader culture:
