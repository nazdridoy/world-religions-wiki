Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki, universally known by his acronym Rashi, stands as the most influential Torah commentator in Jewish history. His clear, concise, and insightful explanations of the Bible and Talmud have become so fundamental to Jewish textual study that his commentary is printed alongside the original text in virtually every traditional edition of these works. For almost a millennium, Rashi's commentary has served as the essential gateway to understanding Jewish sacred texts for scholars and laypeople alike.

## Life and Career

### Early Life and Education

Born in Troyes, France, Rashi belonged to a family of modest means. While little is known about his early years, historical records indicate that he received his initial education in his hometown. Seeking advanced Jewish learning unavailable in France, Rashi traveled to the Rhineland (Germany) in his teens or early twenties to study in the renowned yeshivot (academies) of Mainz and Worms under distinguished scholars including Rabbi Yaakov ben Yakar and Rabbi Isaac ben Judah.

### Return to Troyes

After completing his studies around age 25, Rashi returned to Troyes where he established a vineyard for his livelihood and founded a yeshiva that quickly gained prominence. Without seeking any official position or salary as a rabbi, he attracted numerous students from throughout France and Germany, transforming Troyes into a major center of Jewish learning. His vineyard provided him economic independence, allowing him to devote significant time to teaching and writing.

### Scholarship and Writing

Rashi's scholarly approach was characterized by remarkable clarity, precision, and comprehensive knowledge of rabbinic sources. He developed his commentaries over decades, frequently revising them in response to new insights or questions from students. His works demonstrate his unique ability to distill complex discussions into their essential elements without oversimplification.

Unlike many medieval scholars, Rashi wrote primarily for the general Jewish reader rather than exclusively for scholarly elites. His commentaries address basic questions of meaning and context that any thoughtful reader might encounter, making Jewish texts accessible to a much broader audience.

### Final Years

The latter part of Rashi's life coincided with the First Crusade (1095-1099), which brought devastation to Jewish communities in the Rhineland. While Troyes was spared direct violence, the suffering of nearby communities deeply affected Rashi. Some of his later writings reflect the trauma experienced by French and German Jewry during this period. Despite these challenges, he continued teaching and refining his commentaries until his death in 1105.

## Major Works and Contributions

### Torah Commentary

Rashi's commentary on the Five Books of Moses represents his most celebrated work. Its key features include:

- **Peshat and Derash**: Balance between straightforward contextual meaning and midrashic interpretation
- **Linguistic Clarity**: Explanation of difficult Hebrew terms and phrases
- **Narrative Coherence**: Clarification of chronology and resolving apparent contradictions
- **Targeted Brevity**: Commenting only where necessary for understanding
- **Accessibility**: Simple language that even beginners can comprehend
- **Ethical Dimension**: Drawing moral lessons from the biblical narrative

So essential is Rashi's Torah commentary that the traditional Jewish saying holds: "One cannot claim to have studied the Torah portion without studying Rashi's commentary on it."

### Talmud Commentary

Rashi's commentary covers nearly the entire Babylonian Talmud (with a few tractates completed by his students). Its characteristics include:

- **Textual Clarification**: Explaining the logical flow of Talmudic discussions
- **Linguistic Guidance**: Translating difficult Aramaic terms into French
- **Historical Context**: Providing background for Talmudic disputes and rulings
- **Alternative Manuscript Readings**: Noting textual variants when relevant
- **Cross-References**: Connecting related discussions across the Talmud

This commentary singlehandedly made Talmud study possible for generations of students, earning Rashi the title "Parshandata" (Chief Interpreter).

### Other Biblical Commentaries

Rashi also wrote commentaries on most books of the Hebrew Bible, including:
- The Prophets (Nevi'im)
- Most of the Writings (Ketuvim)
- Particularly noted for his commentary on Song of Songs, which balances literal and allegorical readings

### Responsa and Liturgical Works

Though primarily known for his commentaries, Rashi also:
- Wrote responsa (rabbinic decisions) on various legal questions
- Composed liturgical poems (piyyutim) for synagogue services
- Compiled a siddur (prayer book) with his own commentary

## Methodology and Approach

Rashi's interpretive methodology sets him apart from other commentators:

- **Synthesis of Traditions**: Weaving together Babylonian and Palestinian Talmudic traditions
- **Selective Midrash**: Choosing interpretations that align with the text's plain meaning
- **Linguistic Precision**: Careful attention to grammar, etymology, and syntax
- **Intertextual Reading**: Explaining biblical passages through connections with other biblical texts
- **Concision**: Saying the maximum with minimum words
- **Foreign Language Glosses**: Using Old French terms (written in Hebrew letters) to clarify meaning
