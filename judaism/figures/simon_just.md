![Ancient Temple ritual](simon_just.jpg)

Simon the Just (Hebrew: שִׁמְעוֹן הַצַּדִּיק, Shimon HaTzaddik) was a renowned High Priest during the early Second Temple period who embodied the ideal religious leadership in Jewish tradition. His title "HaTzaddik" (the Righteous One) reflects the high esteem in which he was held, and his legacy encompasses both historical significance and legendary dimensions in Jewish memory.

## Historical Context

- **Era**: Early Second Temple period (late 4th to early 3rd century BCE)
- **Location**: Jerusalem
- **Political Setting**: Period of transition between Persian and Hellenistic rule
- **Primary Sources**: 
  - Ecclesiasticus/Ben Sira 50:1-21
  - Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews
  - Mishnah Avot 1:2
  - Talmudic references in tractates Yoma, Menachot, and others
- **Historical Ambiguity**: There may have been two High Priests named Simon who are sometimes conflated in tradition

## Biographical Details

### Identity and Dating

There is some scholarly debate about Simon's precise identification and chronology:

- **Simon I**: High Priest around 310-291 BCE, during the transition from Persian to Ptolemaic rule
- **Simon II**: High Priest around 219-199 BCE, during the late Ptolemaic period preceding Seleucid control
- **Traditional View**: Jewish tradition generally favors identifying Simon the Just with Simon I, though some modern scholars suggest the grand portrayal in Ben Sira better matches Simon II

### High Priesthood

As High Priest, Simon held the most prestigious religious office in Second Temple Judaism:
- Led Temple worship and officiated on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement)
- Represented the Jewish people before God
- Presided over the Sanhedrin (religious court)
- Served as a political representative to foreign rulers
- Maintained and enhanced the Temple service

### Historical Achievements

Several significant accomplishments are attributed to Simon:

1. **Temple Fortification**: According to Ben Sira, "In his days the Temple was fortified, and he strengthened the sanctuary."
   
2. **Water Supply**: He developed Jerusalem's water supply through cisterns and reservoirs, described as "vast as the sea in circumference."
   
3. **City Walls**: He repaired and reinforced Jerusalem's walls.
   
4. **Religious Stability**: During a period of political transition and cultural change, he maintained religious continuity and preserved traditional worship practices.
   
5. **Administrative Leadership**: He managed the Temple treasury and operations during a formative period in Second Temple Judaism.

## Character and Legacy

### The Portrait in Ben Sira

The most detailed contemporary description of Simon comes from Ben Sira (Ecclesiasticus) chapter 50, which offers an admiring portrait of his conduct as High Priest:

> "How glorious he was when he looked out from the tent, when he came out from the shrine!
> Like a star shining among the clouds, like the full moon at the festal season;
> like the sun shining on the Temple of the Most High, like the rainbow gleaming in splendid clouds..."

This poetic passage continues with vivid descriptions of Simon performing the Temple rituals with dignity and splendor, concluding that "he was like an olive tree laden with fruit, and like a cypress towering in the clouds."

### Teachings in Pirkei Avot

Simon's ethical perspective is preserved in a famous teaching recorded in Pirkei Avot (Ethics of the Fathers) 1:2:

> "Simon the Just was among the last of the Great Assembly. He used to say: Upon three things the world stands:
> - upon Torah
> - upon worship (avodah)
> - and upon acts of loving kindness (gemilut chasadim)"

This foundational statement articulates the three pillars of Jewish religious life, balancing study, ritual practice, and ethical conduct.

### Temple Miracle Traditions

Several Talmudic passages associate Simon's righteousness with miraculous signs in the Temple service:

- During his lifetime, the western lamp of the menorah remained lit miraculously
- The crimson thread used in the Yom Kippur service always turned white (signifying forgiveness)
- The Temple showbread was blessed with supernatural satisfaction, so even a small portion satisfied
- The fire on the altar burned strongly without needing additional wood

According to tradition, these signs ceased after his death, marking a transition in the spiritual status of the Temple service.

## Stories and Legends

### Meeting with Alexander the Great

One of the most famous legends about Simon describes his encounter with Alexander the Great. According to this tradition (recounted in the Talmud, Yoma 69a):

1. When Alexander marched toward Jerusalem intending to destroy it, Simon donned his High Priestly garments and went out to meet him
2. Upon seeing Simon, Alexander descended from his chariot and bowed before him
3. When asked why he would bow to a Jewish priest, Alexander explained that before each battle, he saw a vision of Simon's likeness leading him to victory
4. Instead of destroying Jerusalem, Alexander requested that statues of himself be placed in the Temple
5. Simon suggested an alternative: that all male children born to priests that year would be named Alexander
6. The encounter resulted in favorable treatment for the Jews under Macedonian rule

While historically questionable, this legend reflects the Jewish understanding of divine protection and the respect commanded by righteous leadership.

### Prophecy of Death

Another Talmudic story (Yoma 39b) relates:

1. Every Yom Kippur, Simon would be accompanied by an old man dressed in white when entering and leaving the Holy of Holies
2. One year, he was accompanied by an old man dressed in black
3. Simon interpreted this as a sign that this would be his last year of life
4. He died shortly afterward, just as he had predicted

### Encounter with the Samaritans

Josephus recounts a confrontation between Simon (whom he calls Simon the Just) and the Samaritans, who sought permission from Alexander to build a rival temple on Mount Gerizim. Simon successfully defended the unique status of the Jerusalem Temple as the sole legitimate worship center.

## Theological and Historical Significance

### Last of the Great Assembly

Simon is traditionally considered among the last members of the Anshei Knesset HaGedolah (Men of the Great Assembly), the group of 120 sages who guided Jewish religious life in the transition from prophetic to rabbinic leadership. This places him at a pivotal juncture in Jewish religious development—bridging the biblical and rabbinic eras.

### Model of Priestly Leadership

Simon represents the ideal High Priest in Jewish memory—combining ritual precision, ethical character, political wisdom, and spiritual authenticity. This idealization became especially important after later High Priests during the Hasmonean and Herodian periods were often viewed as corrupt or unworthy.

### Cultural Bridge

Simon functioned during the early Hellenistic period when Greek culture began influencing Jewish life. His steadfast maintenance of tradition while engaging with the changing political landscape provided a model for cultural navigation that would become increasingly important in Jewish history.

### Administrative Founder

His building projects and structural improvements to the Temple and Jerusalem established infrastructure that would serve the Jewish community for generations, until the Roman destruction in 70 CE.

## Interpretations and Influence

### In Rabbinic Judaism

Simon's threefold teaching became a foundational principle in rabbinic thought, influencing how Jewish religious life was conceptualized through the balancing of:
- Intellectual engagement with Torah
- Devotional practice through prayer (replacing Temple worship)
- Ethical behavior through acts of kindness

### Liturgical Remembrance

While not formally honored with a holiday, Simon's legacy is preserved in several liturgical contexts:
- Study of his teachings in Pirkei Avot
- References to the Temple service that he exemplified, especially in Yom Kippur liturgy
- His model of priesthood influences how traditional Judaism envisions the eventual restoration of Temple worship

### Scholarly Perspectives

Modern historians view Simon (whether Simon I or II) as a crucial figure in the consolidation of Second Temple Judaism:
- Strengthening religious institutions during political transition
- Preserving traditional practices amid Hellenistic cultural pressure
- Establishing models of religious leadership that would influence later developments
