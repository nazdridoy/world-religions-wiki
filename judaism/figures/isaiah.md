## Major Themes and Teachings

### Divine Holiness (קָדוֹשׁ - Kadosh)

Isaiah's theology centers on God's transcendent holiness:

- Repeated title "the Holy One of Israel" (used 25 times)
- Throne vision emphasizing God's separateness and purity
- Contrast between divine holiness and human sinfulness
- Ethical implications of holiness for community life
- Purifying judgment as expression of holiness

### Faithful Remnant (שְׁאָר - She'ar)

Isaiah develops the concept of a faithful remnant who will survive judgment:

- Symbolized by his son's name Shear-Jashub
- Shift from quantity to quality in defining Israel
- Purification through suffering and exile
- Future restoration centered on the remnant
- Link between remnant and messianic hope

### Trust in God vs. Political Alliances

A consistent theme is the call to trust God rather than political machinations:

- Critique of alliance with Assyria under Ahaz
- Warning against Egyptian support
- Futility of diplomatic maneuvering without faith
- "In quietness and trust shall be your strength" (30:15)
- Jerusalem's ultimate security rests in divine protection

### Social Justice

Isaiah powerfully condemns social injustice:

- Critique of exploitative economic practices
- Denunciation of corrupt judges and officials
- Advocacy for vulnerable groups (widows, orphans, poor)
- Connection between authentic worship and ethical conduct
- Vision of just social order in the restored community

### Messianic Expectations

Some of Judaism's most significant messianic prophecies come from Isaiah:

- **Royal Messiah**: "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace" (9:6)
- **Davidic Ruler**: "A shoot from the stump of Jesse" with spirit of wisdom and understanding (11:1-5)
- **Servant Figure**: Mysterious figure who suffers vicariously (52:13-53:12)
- **Anointed Proclamation**: "The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me..." (61:1-3)
- **Peaceful Kingdom**: Wolf and lamb coexisting, child playing near snake (11:6-9)

### Universal Vision

Isaiah expands Israel's religious horizon to encompass all nations:

- Foreign peoples streaming to Zion to learn Torah
- Transformation of weapons into agricultural tools
- Egypt and Assyria worshiping alongside Israel
- Servant bringing justice to the nations
- Universal banquet on God's holy mountain

## Historical-Critical Perspectives

### Authorship Questions

### Archaeological Context

Archaeological findings provide context for Isaiah's ministry:

- Assyrian inscriptions confirming biblical events
