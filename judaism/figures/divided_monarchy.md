# Kings of the Divided Monarchy

![Ancient Israelite palace ruins](divided_monarchy.jpg)

After the death of King Solomon around 930 BCE, the united kingdom of Israel split into two separate kingdoms: the northern Kingdom of Israel with its capital eventually at Samaria, and the southern Kingdom of Judah with its capital at Jerusalem. This division lasted until the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom in 722 BCE, while the southern kingdom continued until the Babylonian conquest in 586 BCE.

## Theological Significance

The period of the divided monarchy is interpreted in the Bible as a time of testing Israel's faithfulness to the covenant. The biblical historians judge kings primarily by their religious policies rather than political or military achievements:

- **Deuteronomistic Perspective**: The Books of Kings evaluate monarchs based on their fidelity to exclusive Yahweh worship and centralized worship in Jerusalem
- **Prophetic Critique**: This era saw major prophetic activity including Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah, Amos, Hosea, and Micah
- **Covenant Consequences**: The eventual destruction of both kingdoms is presented as divine punishment for persistent idolatry and covenant violation
- **Davidic Promise**: Despite the failures of many Davidic kings, the divine promise to David's line remained a foundation for future messianic hopes

## Archaeological Evidence

Archaeological discoveries have confirmed aspects of the biblical accounts:
- The "House of David" inscription from Tel Dan (9th century BCE)
- Assyrian records mentioning Israelite and Judahite kings
- Palace structures at Samaria and Jerusalem
- Evidence of destruction layers corresponding to Assyrian and Babylonian conquests
- Shift in religious practices visible in material culture
