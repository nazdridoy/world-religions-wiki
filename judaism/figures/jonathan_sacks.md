He also studied at Yeshiva Etz Chaim in London and later at Jews' College London, where he received his rabbinical ordination (semicha).

### Religious Development

Sacks described a pivotal moment in his religious development when, as a student at Cambridge, he traveled to the United States to meet with several prominent Jewish leaders, including the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. The Rebbe encouraged him to pursue leadership within Judaism rather than remaining solely in the academic world. This encounter significantly influenced Sacks's decision to become a rabbi alongside his academic pursuits.
