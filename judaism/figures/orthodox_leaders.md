Orthodox Jewish leaders have played a crucial role in preserving traditional Judaism through periods of profound social, political, and religious change. From the 19th century to the present, rabbinic authorities in the Orthodox world have responded to modernity, secularism, assimilation, political upheaval, and the Holocaust while maintaining commitment to halakha (Jewish law) and mesorah (tradition), though with diverse approaches ranging from accommodation to resistance.
