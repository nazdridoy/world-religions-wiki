## Biography

### Early Life and Education

Sally Jane Priesand was born on June 27, 1946, in Cleveland, Ohio, to a middle-class Jewish family. Her parents, Irving Theodore Priesand and Rose Elizabeth (n√©e Welch) Priesand, encouraged her intellectual pursuits and religious interests from an early age. While many girls in the 1950s and early 1960s were steered away from ambitious career goals, Priesand received support for her unconventional aspirations.

At the age of 16, she announced her intention to become a rabbi, a goal virtually unprecedented for women at that time. She attended the University of Cincinnati, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1968 while simultaneously beginning her studies at the adjacent Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion (HUC-JIR), the Reform movement's rabbinical seminary.

### Path to Ordination

When Priesand entered HUC-JIR in 1964, there was no formal policy allowing women to be ordained. While a few women had previously enrolled in the academic program, none had completed it with the intention of becoming rabbis. Initially, some faculty members assumed she was pursuing a career in Jewish education rather than the rabbinate.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding her ultimate goal, Priesand excelled academically and persisted in her rabbinical studies. In 1968, the Reform movement's Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) formally announced that women could be ordained as rabbis. This policy change cleared the institutional path for Priesand's ordination.

Her journey was not without challenges. As the only woman in her rabbinical class, she faced skepticism from some classmates and professors. Some questioned whether congregations would accept a female rabbi or whether a woman could balance family responsibilities with the demands of the rabbinate. Nevertheless, she completed the rigorous program of study, writing her thesis on "Judaism and the New Feminism."

### Historic Ordination

On June 3, 1972, at the age of 25, Sally Priesand was ordained as a rabbi by Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, becoming the first woman officially ordained by a rabbinical seminary in America. Her ordination ceremony, led by Rabbi Alfred Gottschalk, marked a watershed moment in Jewish history. The historic significance of the event drew national media attention, with coverage in major newspapers and television programs.

Upon her ordination, Priesand commented: "I want to be a rabbi, not a woman rabbi." This statement reflected her desire to be evaluated on her merits as a religious leader rather than solely as a symbol of gender equality. Nevertheless, she understood and eventually embraced her pioneering role as a trailblazer for women in religious leadership.

### Rabbinical Career

After ordination, Priesand initially served as assistant rabbi at Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in New York City, one of the most prominent Reform congregations in the country. There, she worked under Rabbi Edward Klein, gaining practical experience in pulpit leadership, pastoral care, and community organizing.

In 1981, after brief service at a temple in Elizabeth, New Jersey, she became rabbi of Monmouth Reform Temple in Tinton Falls, New Jersey, where she would serve for 25 years until her retirement in 2006. At Monmouth, she developed a reputation as a caring pastor, thoughtful preacher, and effective administrator, demonstrating that women could excel in all aspects of rabbinical leadership.

Throughout her career, Priesand focused particularly on pastoral care, interfaith relations, and social justice issues. She worked to create an inclusive environment within her congregation while also building bridges to the broader community. Her longevity at Monmouth Reform Temple allowed her to develop deep relationships with congregants and to serve families across multiple generations.

### Later Career and Retirement

As she approached retirement, Priesand became increasingly involved in preserving and documenting the growing history of women in the rabbinate. She donated her personal papers to the American Jewish Archives, helping to establish an important collection on women in Jewish religious leadership.

Upon her retirement in 2006, she was named Rabbi Emerita of Monmouth Reform Temple. In retirement, she has remained active in Jewish affairs, serving on boards of organizations including the Jewish Women's Archive, Hebrew Union College's Board of Governors, and the Society for Classical Reform Judaism.

## Significance and Impact

### Opening the Door for Women in the Rabbinate

Priesand's ordination broke a 2,000-year tradition of exclusively male religious leadership in Judaism. While her individual achievement was significant, her greater impact was in demonstrating that women could serve effectively as rabbis, thereby opening the door for others to follow.

Following her example, all non-Orthodox Jewish denominations eventually accepted women as rabbis:
- Reform Judaism formally accepted women as rabbis with her ordination in 1972
- Reconstructionist Judaism ordained its first female rabbi, Sandy Eisenberg Sasso, in 1974
- Conservative Judaism ordained its first female rabbi, Amy Eilberg, in 1985
- Jewish Renewal and other progressive movements also embraced women's ordination

Today, women constitute approximately half of the students in Reform and Reconstructionist rabbinical programs and a significant percentage in Conservative seminaries.

### Changing Perceptions of Women's Religious Authority

Beyond simply allowing women access to rabbinical schools, Priesand's pioneering role challenged fundamental assumptions about religious authority. Her success helped normalize the idea of women as interpreters of Jewish law and tradition, as ritual leaders, and as spiritual guides.

This shift extended beyond the rabbinate to other areas of Jewish leadership, including cantors, educators, and organizational executives. The presence of women in religious leadership roles has influenced liturgy, theological discourse, and communal priorities throughout American Jewish life.

### Influence on Reform Judaism

Within Reform Judaism, Priesand's ordination accelerated the movement's commitment to gender equality. Reform congregations and institutions increasingly adopted gender-inclusive language, egalitarian liturgy, and policies supporting women's leadership. Her success helped reform Judaism position itself as the most progressive mainstream Jewish denomination on gender issues in the United States.

### Broader Impact on American Religion

Priesand's ordination came during a period when women were beginning to enter religious leadership roles in various American faith traditions. Her breakthrough contributed to wider conversations about women's spiritual authority across religious boundaries and became part of the broader story of women's advancement in American professional life during the 1970s.

## Approach and Philosophy

### Rabbinical Style

As a rabbi, Priesand was known for her warm pastoral presence, practical approach to Jewish tradition, and commitment to inclusivity. Rather than emphasizing scholarly innovation or charismatic leadership, she focused on strengthening community bonds and making Judaism accessible and meaningful to diverse congregants.

Her sermons typically addressed ethical issues and contemporary challenges, connecting Jewish wisdom to everyday concerns. She was particularly attentive to lifecycle events, recognizing their importance in connecting people to their Jewish heritage and community.

### Views on Feminism and Judaism

While Priesand did not initially emphasize her status as a feminist pioneer, she gradually embraced her historic role. She came to recognize that representation matters and that her visible leadership created possibilities for other women. Throughout her career, she advocated for equal opportunity for women in all aspects of Jewish life.

At the same time, she cautioned against reducing her rabbinate to a matter of gender alone, insisting that women rabbis should be evaluated on the quality of their leadership rather than their gender. She maintained that female rabbis bring distinctive perspectives to Jewish leadership while still embodying the core responsibilities of the rabbinate.

### Approach to Jewish Tradition

As a Reform rabbi, Priesand embraced the movement's emphasis on ethical monotheism and the evolution of Jewish tradition. She advocated for inclusive interpretations of Jewish texts and practices, supporting innovations that increased access and meaning for modern Jews while maintaining connection to historical Judaism.

### Institutional Recognition

The Sally J. Priesand Visiting Professorship at Hebrew Union College was established in her honor to bring distinguished female scholars and rabbis to teach rabbinical students. Additionally, the Women's Rabbinic Network created the Rabbi Sally J. Priesand Scholarship Fund to support female rabbinical students.

### Cultural Representation

Priesand's groundbreaking ordination has been included in museum exhibits on American Jewish history, including at the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia. Her papers are preserved at the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati, ensuring that future generations can study her contributions.

## Personal Life and Character

While her public identity has been defined largely by her rabbinical career, colleagues and congregants describe Priesand as modest about her historic role and focused on her day-to-day responsibilities. She has maintained an interest in art, becoming an accomplished papercutter and watercolorist in her later years.

Throughout her career, Priesand emphasized the importance of work-life balance and self-care for clergy, recognizing the emotional demands of rabbinical life. She has been open about the professional sacrifices and personal challenges involved in being a pioneer, while consistently affirming that her choice to become a rabbi was the right one for her life.
