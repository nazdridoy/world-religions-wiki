![Portrait of Mordecai Kaplan](kaplan_portrait.jpg)

## Life and Background

Mordecai Menahem Kaplan was born on June 11, 1881, in Lithuania, and immigrated to the United States with his family at the age of eight. His father, Rabbi Israel Kaplan, was an Orthodox rabbi who served various congregations in New York City. Kaplan received both a traditional Jewish education and a secular education, studying at the City College of New York, Columbia University, and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS). He was ordained as a rabbi at JTS in 1902.

Kaplan's career spanned several decades and institutions. He served as the rabbi of Kehilath Jeshurun, an Orthodox congregation in New York (1903-1909), and was later associated with the newly established Jewish Center in Manhattan. However, his primary professional home was JTS, where he taught for over fifty years (1909-1963). He also helped establish the Teachers Institute at JTS and served as its principal.

## Intellectual Development

Kaplan's theological and philosophical thinking evolved throughout his long career, influenced by several key factors:

### American Context

Living through America's progressive era, two world wars, and the secularization of American society, Kaplan sought to reframe Judaism for American Jews who were rapidly assimilating and finding traditional Jewish theology increasingly difficult to accept.

### Academic Training

Kaplan's education at Columbia University exposed him to contemporary philosophical, sociological, and anthropological thinking. He was particularly influenced by John Dewey's pragmatism, Émile Durkheim's sociological approach to religion, and the emerging field of functional psychology.

### Traditional Learning

Despite his radical theological positions, Kaplan maintained deep knowledge of and respect for traditional Jewish texts and practices. His innovations were intended not to destroy tradition but to preserve its vitality in a changed context.

### Personal Experience

As a pulpit rabbi, Kaplan observed firsthand the challenges facing American Jews trying to reconcile their heritage with modern life. This practical experience grounded his theoretical work.

## Judaism as a Civilization

Kaplan's most significant and revolutionary contribution was his reconceptualization of Judaism not as a religion alone but as a comprehensive civilization. This idea, developed in his 1934 masterwork *Judaism as a Civilization*, challenged conventional categories and contained several key elements:

### Civilization Concept

Kaplan defined Judaism as "the evolving religious civilization of the Jewish people," encompassing language, literature, arts, ethics, social organization, history, symbols, and spiritual practices—not just theological beliefs.

### Rejection of Supernatural

Kaplan rejected supernatural understandings of God and divine revelation, instead viewing religious concepts as human constructions that serve functional purposes in communal life. He redefined God as "the power that makes for salvation" rather than a personal deity.

### Cultural Evolution

He viewed Jewish traditions as evolving responses to changing historical circumstances rather than divinely ordained and unchangeable practices. This evolutionary approach allowed for creative adaptation of tradition to contemporary needs.

### Jewish Peoplehood

Kaplan emphasized belonging to the Jewish people as the primary basis of Jewish identity, rather than theological beliefs or ritual observances. This "peoplehood" concept influenced later Jewish communal policies.

## Practical Innovations

Kaplan's theoretical work led to numerous practical innovations in Jewish religious life:

### Liturgical Reform

Kaplan created a new prayer book, *The Sabbath Prayer Book* (1945), which eliminated or reinterpreted traditional prayers that conflicted with modern sensibilities, including references to the chosen people, bodily resurrection, and restoration of sacrifices.

### Bat Mitzvah Ceremony

In 1922, Kaplan held the first public Bat Mitzvah ceremony for his daughter Judith, creating a ritual that has since become standard across most Jewish denominations and transforming the status of women in Jewish ritual life.

### Synagogue Center

Kaplan pioneered the concept of the synagogue as a comprehensive center for Jewish life beyond prayer, incorporating educational, cultural, and recreational activities—a model widely adopted by American synagogues.

### Organic Jewish Community

He advocated for reconstructing Jewish communal organization on a voluntary, democratic basis appropriate to the American context, inspiring later communal structures like Jewish Community Centers and Federations.

## Reconstructionist Movement

Although Kaplan never intended to create a separate denomination, his ideas eventually crystallized into an institutional movement:

### The Society for the Advancement of Judaism

In 1922, Kaplan established the Society for the Advancement of Judaism (SAJ) as an experimental synagogue implementing his ideas, which became the first Reconstructionist congregation.

### Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation

In 1940, the Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation was established to disseminate Kaplan's ideas through publications, including the influential journal *The Reconstructionist*.

### Institutional Development

The Reconstructionist movement slowly developed formal institutions, including the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (founded 1968) and eventually a denominational organization, now called Reconstructing Judaism.

### Contemporary Influence

Today, Reconstructionist Judaism represents a small but intellectually significant movement within American Judaism, known for its progressive stance on social issues, democratic governance structures, and creative liturgical innovations.

## Controversies and Criticism

Kaplan's ideas generated substantial controversy within the Jewish community:

### Orthodox Response

His 1945 prayer book was ceremonially burned by the Union of Orthodox Rabbis, who considered his theological positions heretical. He remained persona non grata in Orthodox circles throughout his life.

### Conservative Tensions

Despite teaching at JTS for decades, Kaplan's radical theology created tensions within the Conservative movement. Though never expelled, he existed at the movement's leftmost margins.

### Theological Critiques

Critics argued that Kaplan's naturalistic approach emptied Judaism of its spiritual core and reduced it to mere sociology. Others questioned whether his functional approach to religion could inspire the commitment necessary for Jewish survival.

### Zionism

While strongly supportive of Jewish settlement in Palestine and later Israel, Kaplan's concept of a binational state differed from mainstream Zionism, creating additional tensions.

## Legacy and Influence

Kaplan's influence extends far beyond the Reconstructionist movement itself:

### Transdenominational Impact

Many of Kaplan's ideas, initially considered radical, have been normalized across Jewish denominations, including his emphasis on Jewish peoplehood, community centers, and the bat mitzvah ceremony.

### American Jewish Identity

Kaplan's articulation of Judaism as both a religion and a civilization helped create a framework for secular and cultural expressions of Jewish identity in America.

### Jewish Feminism

His early willingness to rethink gender roles in Judaism helped create intellectual space for later Jewish feminist developments.

### Jewish Education

Kaplan's emphasis on experiential education and enculturation rather than mere transmission of information influenced generations of Jewish educators.
