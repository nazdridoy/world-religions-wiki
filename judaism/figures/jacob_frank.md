## Biographical Information

### Early Life

Jacob Frank was born Jakub Lejbowicz to a Jewish family in Podolia, then part of Poland (now Ukraine). His father was a merchant who traveled frequently, and young Jacob received little formal Jewish education. In his youth, he moved to the Ottoman Empire, where he engaged in trade and was exposed to remnants of the Sabbatean movement that had developed following Sabbatai Zevi's messianic claims in the previous century.

### Development of Frankism

Frank's religious career began around 1751 when he returned to Poland and began to gather followers. He claimed special knowledge of mystical secrets and declared himself a messiah, building upon the remnants of Sabbateanism while adding his own radical interpretations:

- Proclaimed himself the reincarnation of Sabbatai Zevi
- Adopted the name "Frank" (meaning "free" or "open")
- Developed a doctrine that rejected traditional Jewish law
- Advocated "strange acts" (ma'asim zarim) including ritual transgression
- Framed his movement as the "true Judaism" or the "religion of Edom"

### Religious Disputations and Conversion

Frank led his followers into direct confrontation with mainstream Jewish authorities:

- In 1757, Frankists engaged in a public disputation with rabbis, accusing traditional Judaism of using blood for ritual purposes
- Claimed the Talmud taught hatred of Christians
- In 1759, at Frank's direction, about 3,000 of his followers converted to Catholicism
- Frank himself was baptized, with Polish King Augustus III serving as his godfather
- Despite conversion, Frankists maintained a secret adherence to their mystical beliefs

### Imprisonment and Later Life

After his conversion, Frank's continued unconventional religious practices raised suspicions:

- Catholic authorities determined his teachings were not genuinely Christian
- In 1760, he was arrested for heresy and imprisoned in the Częstochowa fortress
- Spent 13 years in relatively comfortable captivity, continuing to direct his movement
- Released in 1772 when the Russian army captured the area during the First Partition of Poland
- Moved to Moravia and then to Offenbach, Germany, where he lived in baronial style
- Established a semi-royal court where he was treated as a holy king
- Died in 1791, leaving his daughter Eva as the leader of the movement

## Theological Teachings

### Antinomianism

Central to Frank's theology was a radical antinomianism (rejection of religious law):

- Taught that all laws and religions had to be overthrown
- Believed in the spiritual value of transgressing religious prohibitions
- Advocated "the crossing of abyss" through deliberate sin
- Claimed that redemption comes through the nullification of all religious norms
- Developed the paradoxical concept that descent into sin leads to ascent toward God

### Messianic Claims

Frank's messianic ideology included:

- Belief in successive incarnations of the messiah (Sabbatai Zevi, then himself)
- Rejection of traditional messianic expectations
- Promise of material and spiritual liberation
- Claim to possess secret knowledge revealed only to initiates
- Prophecy that the messianic era required the rejection of all previous religious forms

### Secret Doctrine

Frank's inner teachings, not fully revealed to all followers, reportedly included:

- Elements of Trinitarian theology adapted from Christianity
- Reverence for the female divine element (the Shekhinah)
- Belief in "the Good God" hidden behind the God of traditional religion
- View that the world was created and ruled by evil powers
- Secret rituals that included sexual practices forbidden in traditional Judaism

### Relationship to Sabbateanism

Frank built upon but modified the earlier Sabbatean movement:

- Continued Sabbatai Zevi's concept of "redemption through sin"
- More radical in the explicit rejection of Jewish law
- More open to elements of Christian symbolism and doctrine
- More politically engaged with Christian authorities
- More focused on the physical embodiment of the messianic figure

## Historical Controversies

### Blood Libel Allegations

One of the most disturbing aspects of Frankism was the group's tactical use of blood libel accusations:

- During the 1757 disputation, Frankists claimed some Jews used Christian blood for rituals
- This reinforced dangerous antisemitic stereotypes
- The tactic was likely used to gain Christian protection against rabbinic authorities
- These accusations had devastating consequences for Jewish communities
- This remains one of the most condemned aspects of Frank's legacy

Controversial reports about Frankist sexual practices include:

- Allegations of ritualized sexual libertinism
- Reports of wife-sharing among adherents

### Authenticity Debates

Scholars continue to debate Frank's motivations:

- Was he a genuine religious visionary or an opportunistic charlatan?
- Did he actually believe his messianic claims?
- Were his conversions tactical or sincere?
- Did he develop a coherent theology or merely ad-hoc justifications?
- What role did power and wealth play in his leadership?
