## Biography

### Early Life and Portuguese Career

Isaac Abravanel was born into a wealthy and prestigious Jewish family in Lisbon, Portugal. His family had a tradition of scholarship and service to the crown. He received an excellent education in traditional Jewish subjects as well as secular disciplines including classical literature, philosophy, and politics.

By his thirties, Abravanel had risen to become the treasurer and financial advisor to King Alfonso V of Portugal. During this period, he also began his literary career, writing philosophical works including a commentary on Maimonides' "Guide for the Perplexed."

### Spanish Period

After the death of Alfonso V in 1481, political circumstances forced Abravanel to flee Portugal. He settled in Castile, Spain, where his talents were quickly recognized by Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, who appointed him as a financial advisor despite their generally anti-Jewish policies.

During his time in Spain, Abravanel began his monumental project of writing comprehensive commentaries on the Bible. He also became a leader of Spanish Jewry during increasingly difficult times, as the Inquisition intensified its activities.

### Exile and Later Years

When the Edict of Expulsion was issued in 1492, Abravanel, unlike many other wealthy and connected Jews, refused offers to remain in Spain if he converted to Christianity. Instead, he chose exile, using his wealth and influence to help many fellow Jews in their flight.

Abravanel first went to Naples, where he again secured a position as financial advisor to the king. When the French invaded Naples in 1495, he was forced to flee again, eventually settling in Venice, where he spent his final years completing his literary works and serving as a diplomat for the Venetian republic until his death in 1508.
