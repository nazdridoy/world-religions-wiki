## Biblical Narrative

### Early Life and Call

Born during the Egyptian oppression of the Israelites, Moses was placed in a basket in the Nile River to escape Pharaoh's decree to kill all Hebrew male infants. He was discovered and adopted by Pharaoh's daughter, thus growing up in the Egyptian royal court.

After killing an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave, Moses fled to Midian, where he married Tzipporah and became a shepherd. At Mount Horeb (Sinai), God appeared to him in a burning bush and commissioned him to return to Egypt and lead the Israelites to freedom, despite Moses' protests about his inadequate speaking abilities.

### Exodus and Liberation

Moses, along with his brother Aaron, confronted Pharaoh, demanding the release of the Israelites. After Pharaoh repeatedly refused, God sent ten plagues upon Egypt. Finally, after the death of the firstborn Egyptians, Pharaoh relented, leading to the Israelite exodus from Egypt.

Moses led the people across the Sea of Reeds (traditionally the Red Sea), which miraculously parted to allow their escape and then closed upon the pursuing Egyptian army. This event is celebrated annually during Passover (Pesach) and is regarded as the founding moment of Israelite nationhood.

### Sinai Revelation and Law

The pivotal moment in Moses' leadership came at Mount Sinai, where he ascended to receive the Torah directly from God. According to tradition, he remained on the mountain for forty days and nights, receiving the Ten Commandments and the entire body of Jewish law. During his absence, the people constructed a Golden Calf, leading to Moses' anger and the breaking of the first set of tablets. After the people's repentance, Moses ascended again to receive a second set.

### Wilderness Leadership

For forty years, Moses led the Israelites through the wilderness, during which time:
- He established a judicial system on the advice of his father-in-law Jethro
- He oversaw the construction of the Tabernacle (Mishkan)
- He interceded with God on behalf of the people after various rebellions
- He taught the laws and maintained order within the community
- He managed the Israelites' relationships with neighboring peoples

### Death and Legacy

Despite his faithful service, Moses was not permitted to enter the Promised Land due to an incident at Meribah where he struck a rock to produce water rather than speaking to it as God had commanded. After appointing Joshua as his successor, Moses gave farewell speeches (recorded in Deuteronomy) and ascended Mount Nebo, where he viewed the Promised Land before dying at 120 years of age.

According to tradition, Moses was buried by God Himself in an unknown location.

## Religious Significance

### In Jewish Theology

Moses holds an unparalleled position in Judaism:

- **Supreme Prophet**: Described in Deuteronomy 34:10 as unequaled: "There never arose in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face"

- **Intercessor**: Repeatedly pleaded with God to forgive the people's transgressions
- **Perfect Leader**: Combined humility with determination and vision
- **Model of Righteousness**: Exemplified devotion to God and the people

The Maimonidean 13 Principles of Faith includes belief in the prophecy of Moses and the immutability of the Torah he received.
