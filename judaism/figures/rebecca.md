## Biblical Narrative

### Meeting Eliezer and Marriage

Rebecca's story begins dramatically in Genesis 24. After Sarah's death, Abraham sends his servant (traditionally identified as Eliezer) to find a wife for Isaac from among his kindred in Mesopotamia. Arriving at a well outside the city of Nahor, the servant prays for a sign: the woman destined for Isaac would not only offer him water but would volunteer to water his camels as well.

Rebecca appears at the well and fulfills precisely this criterion, demonstrating extraordinary hospitality and industriousness by offering to draw water for all ten camels – a considerable task, as camels can drink up to 25 gallons each. The servant gives her gold jewelry and asks about her family, learning she is the granddaughter of Abraham's brother Nahor.

When brought to Rebecca's home, the servant relates his mission and the sign that identified her. Her family consults Rebecca about whether she is willing to leave immediately with the servant, and she famously declares, "I will go" (אֵלֵךְ/elech), showing decisive courage in agreeing to marry a man she has never met and journey to a distant land.

Upon arriving in Canaan, Rebecca sees Isaac from afar and modestly covers herself with a veil. Isaac brings her into his mother Sarah's tent and marries her, finding comfort after his mother's death.

### Struggle with Infertility and Divine Revelation

Like Sarah before her, Rebecca experiences difficulty conceiving. After twenty years of marriage, Isaac prays for his wife, and she becomes pregnant with twins who "struggle within her." Troubled by the tumultuous pregnancy, Rebecca "inquires of the Lord" directly – a notable act of spiritual initiative.

God's response is one of the most significant prophecies in Genesis: "Two nations are in your womb, two peoples shall be separated from your body; one people shall be stronger than the other, and the elder shall serve the younger." This divine revelation becomes Rebecca's guiding insight for her subsequent actions.

She gives birth to twins: Esau (red and hairy) emerges first, followed by Jacob grasping his brother's heel. As the boys grow, the text notes their differences: Esau becomes a skilled hunter, "a man of the field," favored by Isaac; Jacob is "a mild man, dwelling in tents," favored by Rebecca.

### The Blessing Deception

The central drama of Rebecca's story occurs when Isaac, old and blind, decides to bestow his blessing on Esau before dying. Overhearing Isaac's instruction to Esau to hunt game and prepare a meal before receiving the blessing, Rebecca intervenes decisively on Jacob's behalf.

She instructs Jacob to fetch two kids from the flock, which she prepares according to Isaac's taste. When Jacob expresses concern about deceiving his father, Rebecca famously declares, "Upon me be your curse, my son," taking full responsibility for the plan. She dresses Jacob in Esau's clothes and covers his hands and neck with goatskins to simulate Esau's hairiness.

The deception succeeds, and Isaac bestows the primary blessing – promising abundance, dominion, and the Abrahamic covenant – upon Jacob. When Esau returns and the deception is discovered, Isaac confirms that Jacob will indeed keep the blessing.

### Protection of Jacob and Later Life

When Esau threatens to kill Jacob after their father's death, Rebecca again acts decisively, arranging for Jacob to flee to her brother Laban in Haran. She convinces Isaac to send Jacob to find a wife among their relatives, thus providing a legitimate reason for his departure while protecting him from Esau's anger.

The Torah does not record Rebecca's death, though Jewish tradition places her death during Jacob's absence. Genesis 49:31 notes that she was buried in the Cave of Machpelah in Hebron alongside Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, and Leah.
