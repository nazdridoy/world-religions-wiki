# Prasada - Sanctified Food Offerings

![Prasada distribution at temple](prasada_offering.jpg)

Prasada (also spelled prasad, prasadam) is food that is first offered to a deity and then distributed to devotees as a divine blessing. The term comes from the Sanskrit "prasƒÅda," meaning "grace" or "divine favor." This practice forms an essential part of Hindu worship and represents the tangible, edible manifestation of divine grace.

## Origins and Significance

The tradition of offering food to deities and then consuming it as blessed remnants has roots in ancient Vedic rituals. References to food offerings appear in the Rigveda and elaborate procedures are detailed in the Brahmanas.

Prasada holds multiple layers of significance in Hindu spirituality:

- It represents the divine blessing and grace of the deity
- It serves as a medium of communion between devotees and the divine
- It transforms ordinary food into a vehicle for spiritual nutrition
- It demonstrates the reciprocal relationship between worshiper and worshiped
- It symbolizes the acceptance of the devotee's offering by the deity
- It embodies the principle that everything ultimately returns to the devotee as divine grace

## Process of Preparation and Offering

### Preparation Standards

Prasada preparation follows strict principles:
- The cook must be ritually clean, having bathed before cooking
- The cooking area must be purified
- Silence or recitation of mantras is often maintained during preparation
- Only vegetarian ingredients are used for most temple prasada
- Specific rules about which utensils can be used
- No tasting of food before offering to the deity
- Mental attitude of service and devotion while preparing

### Offering Ritual (Naivedya)

Once prepared, the food undergoes a formal offering ritual:
1. Food is arranged on special plates, often made of silver, bronze, or banana leaves
2. It is brought before the deity with ritualistic procedures
3. The priest or devotee offers it with specific mantras
4. The food remains before the deity for a prescribed time (allowing the deity to "consume" its subtle essence)
5. Often accompanied by waving of incense, lamps, or other ritual elements
6. A bell is rung to mark the moment of offering
7. After offering, the food is removed and becomes prasada

## Prasada in Different Traditions

### In Vaishnavism

Vaishnava temples, especially those dedicated to Krishna, often have elaborate prasada offerings. The Bhagavata Purana emphasizes that Krishna accepts even simple offerings made with devotion. The ISKCON (Hare Krishna) movement places special emphasis on prasada as a means of spiritual advancement.

### In Shaivism

Shaivite traditions often involve special prasada like vibhuti (sacred ash) and bilva leaves alongside food offerings. In some Shiva temples, prasada includes unique items like dhatura (a type of intoxicant that is symbolically offered but not consumed).

### In Shaktism

Goddess worship sometimes includes non-vegetarian prasada in certain traditions, especially during festivals like Durga Puja. The offering of blood sacrifice in some Kali temples results in a different type of prasada distribution, though many modern Shakta temples have shifted to vegetarian offerings.

### In Smartism

The Smarta tradition, which worships five deities equally, prepares different kinds of prasada appropriate for each deity during puja ceremonies.

## Regional Variations

### North Indian Traditions

North Indian prasada often includes wheat-based offerings like puri and chapati, along with chickpea preparations and milk sweets. Temples in Mathura and Vrindavan specialize in milk-based prasada items.

### South Indian Traditions

South Indian temples are known for rice-based offerings like pongal, tamarind rice, and sweet rice preparations. Coconut is a common ingredient in South Indian prasada. The system of offering and distribution is highly organized in major temples.

### East Indian Traditions

Bengali temples emphasize offerings of rice, fish (in some cases), and sweets like sandesh and rosogolla. In Jagannath Temple at Puri, the elaborate Mahaprasad tradition involves 56 different food items.

### West Indian Traditions

Gujarati temples offer distinctive items like thepla and shrikhand. Maharashtra's Vitthal temples are known for their simple grain offerings.

## Philosophical and Spiritual Aspects

### Purification of Food

Hindu philosophy holds that the deity's "consumption" of the subtle essence of the food purifies it in several ways:
- Removes negative energies or impurities
- Infuses it with divine consciousness
- Transforms it from ordinary food to spiritualized substance
- Makes it beneficial for both physical and spiritual health

### Reciprocal Relationship

The prasada system embodies a complete cycle of devotion:
1. Devotee offers food cultivated from the earth (divine creation)
2. Deity accepts the offering
3. Deity returns it as blessed prasada
4. Devotee receives divine grace in tangible form

### Spiritual Economy

The prasada system creates a spiritual economy where:
- All food ultimately belongs to the divine
- Humans are stewards rather than owners
- Sharing is an integral part of spiritual practice
- Consumption becomes a sacred rather than mundane act

## Social Dimensions

### Community Building

Prasada distribution serves important social functions:
- Creates community bonds through shared sacred consumption
- Breaks down social barriers when all partake of the same food
- Provides food for the needy through temple distribution systems
- Establishes spiritual equality when all receive the same divine blessing

### Prasada Seva (Service)

The preparation and distribution of prasada is considered a highly meritorious form of service:
- Major temples have dedicated volunteer groups for prasada service
- Many devotees sponsor prasada for temples as a form of contribution
- In some traditions, prasada distribution is seen as equal in merit to building temples

## Contemporary Practices

### Institutional Adaptations

Modern Hindu temples have adapted prasada traditions to contemporary needs:
- Packaged prasada for worldwide shipping from major temples
- Automated laddu-making machines at Tirupati
- Food safety certifications for temple kitchens
- Mass distribution systems at large festivals
- Online ordering of prasada from famous temples

### Home Practice

Home-based prasada practices include:
- Daily food offerings at household shrines
- Special prasada preparation for house pujas and ceremonies
- Bringing temple prasada home to share with family members who couldn't attend

## Etiquette and Customs

Specific customs govern the appropriate handling of prasada:
- Receiving prasada with right hand or both hands cupped together
- Never refusing prasada when offered
- Consuming it with respect, not criticizing its taste or quality
- Not allowing it to touch the ground
- Consuming it completely; wasting prasada is considered disrespectful
