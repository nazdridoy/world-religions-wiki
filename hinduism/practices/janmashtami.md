Janmashtami (also known as Krishna Janmashtami, Gokulashtami, or Krishnashtami) is one of the most widely celebrated Hindu festivals, commemorating the birth of Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu. It is observed on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in the month of Bhadrapada (August-September) in the Hindu calendar.

## Historical and Mythological Background

### The Birth Story

According to Hindu mythology, Krishna was born in Mathura to Devaki and Vasudeva. His maternal uncle, King Kamsa, had imprisoned his parents because of a prophecy that the eighth child of Devaki would kill him. After killing Devaki's first six children, Kamsa waited for the seventh and eighth. 

The seventh child (Balarama) was transferred mystically to the womb of Rohini (another wife of Vasudeva). When Krishna, the eighth child, was born at midnight, the prison doors miraculously opened. Vasudeva carried baby Krishna across the flooding Yamuna River to Gokul, where he was raised by his foster parents, Yashoda and Nanda.

### Textual References

The story of Krishna's birth is primarily found in:
- The Bhagavata Purana
- The Harivamsa (an appendix to the Mahabharata)
- The Vishnu Purana

## Observances and Rituals

4. **Rasa Lila**: Dramatic reenactments of Krishna's life, especially his playful activities with the gopis.

   - Aarti (ritual of lights)
   - Blowing of conch shells
   - Ringing of bells
   - Special prayers

6. **Breaking the Fast**: After the midnight celebration, devotees break their fast with prasada (sanctified food).

### Regional Variations
