The Hindu calendar system is a complex and sophisticated method of timekeeping that integrates astronomical observations with religious and cultural practices. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, which is purely solar, traditional Hindu calendars incorporate both solar and lunar cycles, creating a system that connects cosmic movements with religious observances, agricultural activities, and daily life.

## Fundamental Structure

### Basic Concepts

- **Panchanga**: The traditional Hindu almanac tracking five elements of time
  - Tithi (lunar day)
  - Vara (weekday)
  - Nakshatra (lunar mansion/constellation)
  - Yoga (auspicious period)
  - Karana (half of a tithi)
- **Luni-Solar Calculation**: Incorporation of both lunar phases and solar movement
- **Regional Variations**: Multiple calendar systems across different parts of India
- **Religious Significance**: Determining auspicious times for ceremonies and festivals

### Cosmic Time Scales

- **Kalpa**: 4.32 billion years, a day in the life of Brahma
- **Manvantara**: 306.72 million years, the reign of one Manu
- **Mahayuga**: 4.32 million years, comprising four yugas
- **Yuga Cycle**: Four ages (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali) of decreasing virtue
- **Samvatsara**: A solar year in the 60-year Jupiter cycle
