# Japa - Sacred Mantra Repetition

![Japa practice with mala beads](japa_practice.jpg)

Japa is a spiritual discipline in Hinduism involving the meditative repetition of a mantra or name of a divine power. The word "japa" comes from the Sanskrit root "jap" (जप्) meaning "to utter in a low voice, repeat internally, or mutter."

## Definition and Purpose

Japa is the repetitive recitation of a mantra, divine name, or sacred formula, typically done using a string of prayer beads called a mala. This practice serves multiple purposes:

- Creating a direct connection with the divine
- Focusing and calming the mind
- Awakening spiritual consciousness
- Accumulating spiritual merit
- Purifying the mind and heart
- Obtaining divine grace and protection

## Types of Japa

Japa can be performed in three primary ways:

1. **Vaikhari Japa** (audible): Chanting out loud, where the practitioner and others can hear the mantra
2. **Upamshu Japa** (whispered): Chanting softly, where only the practitioner can hear it
3. **Manasika Japa** (mental): Silent repetition within the mind, considered the most powerful form

There are also classifications based on the purpose and context:

- **Nitya Japa**: Daily prescribed practice
- **Naimittika Japa**: Performed for a specific purpose or occasion
- **Kamya Japa**: Done with a specific desire in mind
- **Prayashchitta Japa**: Performed as an atonement for errors or sins
- **Achala Japa**: Performed while sitting in a fixed position
- **Chala Japa**: Performed while moving or walking

## The Mala (Prayer Beads)

A traditional mala used for japa typically consists of:

- 108 beads (or 54, 27, or other divisors of 108)
- A larger "sumeru" or "guru" bead that marks the beginning and end of a cycle
- Often made of specific materials like rudraksha seeds, tulsi wood, crystal, or sandalwood

The practitioner typically:
1. Holds the mala in the right hand
2. Uses the thumb to move each bead toward the body
3. Recites one mantra per bead
4. Does not cross over the sumeru when completing a cycle, but reverses direction
