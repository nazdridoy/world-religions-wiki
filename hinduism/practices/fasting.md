![Hindu fasting](fasting_hindu.jpg)

Fasting, known as *upavasa* or *vrata* in Sanskrit, is a fundamental spiritual discipline in Hinduism. It involves abstaining from food and sometimes water for varying periods to purify the body and mind, focus on spiritual practices, and demonstrate devotion to specific deities.

## Types of Hindu Fasts

Hindu fasting practices vary widely in terms of their severity, duration, and observance methods:

### By Severity

1. **Complete Fast (Nirjala Upavasa)** - Abstaining from both food and water
2. **Water Fast (Jala Upavasa)** - Consuming only water
3. **Partial Fast (Phalahara)** - Consuming only fruits, milk, and water
4. **Single Meal Fast** - Eating only once during the day
5. **Restricted Diet Fast** - Avoiding specific foods (like grains, salt, or spices)

### By Duration

1. **One-day Fasts** - Most common, observed from sunrise to sunset or for 24 hours
2. **Multi-day Fasts** - Ranging from 2-9 days, often during festivals like Navratri
3. **Intermittent Fasts** - Such as fasting on specific days of the week
4. **Long-term Fasts** - Extended periods of restricted eating (rare, usually undertaken by ascetics)
