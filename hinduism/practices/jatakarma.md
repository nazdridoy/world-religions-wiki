Jatakarma (also spelled Jatakarman) is one of the sixteen samskaras (sacraments) in Hinduism and represents the first set of rituals performed after the birth of a child. This ceremony welcomes the newborn into the world and marks the beginning of the child's life outside the womb, setting the foundation for spiritual and physical well-being.

## Historical Background

### Textual References

The Jatakarma samskara is described in several authoritative texts:

- **Grihya Sutras**: Contains detailed procedures for the ritual
- **Manusmriti**: Establishes it as an essential samskara
- **Dharma Shastras**: Explains its religious significance
- **Ayurvedic texts** (like Charaka Samhita): Discusses health benefits of the practices

### Historical Evolution

The ritual has evolved through various periods:
- **Vedic Period**: Highly formalized with specific mantras and offerings
- **Classical Period**: Integration with astrological considerations
- **Medieval Period**: Absorption of regional and local customs
- **Modern Era**: Simplification with focus on essential symbolic elements

## Ritual Procedures

### Timing

Traditionally, Jatakarma is performed:
- Before the umbilical cord is cut
- If not possible, within the first 24 hours after birth
- In some traditions, on an auspicious day determined by astrology within the first week

### Preparatory Steps

1. **Purification**: Ritual cleansing of the space
2. **Setting up ritual items**:
   - A small fire (if performing homa)
   - Ghee (clarified butter)
   - Honey
   - Gold
   - Water for purification
   - Various herbs
3. **Invocation of deities**: Particularly those associated with childbirth and protection

### Core Rituals

The Jatakarma involves several key elements:

1. **Medha Janana** (Stimulation of intelligence):
   - Father places a small amount of ghee and honey in the child's mouth using a gold implement
   - Recitation of mantra for bestowing intelligence and long life
   - This is known as "feeding honey" (Madhu Prasana)

2. **Ayushya** (Longevity blessing):
   - Father whispers blessings for long life into the child's ear
   - Touches various parts of the infant's body while reciting appropriate mantras

3. **NƒÅmakarna** (Preliminary naming):
   - A temporary, secret name may be given
   - Often based on the nakshatra (birth star)
   - The formal naming (Namakarana) happens later, usually on the 11th day

4. **Bathing rituals**:
   - Ritual cleansing with water containing herbs
   - Sometimes performed symbolically if the infant's health is delicate

## Symbolic and Spiritual Significance
