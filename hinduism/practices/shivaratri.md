Maha Shivaratri (Great Night of Shiva) is one of the most significant festivals in Shaivism, a major branch of Hinduism devoted to Lord Shiva. Observed on the fourteenth day of the dark half of the lunar month of Phalguna (February-March), this solemn festival celebrates the wedding of Shiva and Parvati, as well as Shiva's cosmic dance of creation and destruction.

## Historical and Mythological Origins

### Primary Mythological Accounts

Several stories explain the significance of Shivaratri:

1. **The Marriage of Shiva and Parvati**: Shivaratri marks the day when Shiva married Parvati, bringing together the masculine and feminine energies of the universe.

2. **Samudra Manthan**: During the churning of the cosmic ocean, a deadly poison emerged that threatened all creation. Shiva drank the poison to save the universe, holding it in his throat (which turned blue, earning him the name Neelakantha). Shivaratri commemorates this selfless act.

3. **Lingodbhava**: On this night, Shiva first manifested as a lingam (his symbolic form). The festival celebrates this primordial appearance.

4. **The Hunter's Story**: A hunter, seeking shelter in a forest during the night, climbed a Bilva tree and accidentally dropped its leaves onto a Shiva lingam below. This unwitting worship pleased Shiva, who granted the hunter salvation.

### Textual References

Shivaratri is mentioned in several Hindu texts:
- The Shiva Purana
- The Linga Purana
- The Skanda Purana

## Observances and Rituals

### Preparations

Devotees prepare for Shivaratri by:
- Cleaning their homes and temples
- Gathering offerings, especially Bilva (Bael) leaves, considered sacred to Shiva
- Preparing for a night-long vigil

### Core Rituals

1. **Fasting**: Most devotees observe a strict fast, either consuming only fruits and milk or nothing at all.

2. **Abhishekam**: The ritual bathing of the Shiva lingam with various substances:
   - Milk
   - Yogurt
   - Honey
   - Ghee (clarified butter)
   - Water
   - Sugar
   - Each substance has symbolic significance and is offered while reciting mantras.

3. **Bilva Offering**: Trifoliate Bilva leaves are offered to the lingam, believed to be especially pleasing to Shiva.

4. **Four Praharas**: The night is divided into four quarters (praharas), each requiring specific rituals:
   - First prahara: Bathing the lingam with milk
   - Second prahara: Curd abhishekam
   - Third prahara: Ghee abhishekam
   - Fourth prahara: Honey abhishekam

5. **Vigil and Chanting**: Devotees stay awake the entire night (jaagaran), reciting:
   - "Om Namah Shivaya" (the Panchakshari Mantra)
   - Rudram
   - Chamakam
   - Shiva Sahasranama (1000 names of Shiva)

6. **Breaking the Fast**: The fast is broken the next morning after performing morning rituals and prayers.

2. **Overcoming Ego**: The night is ideal for meditation to overcome one's ego, which Shiva conquered by burning Kama (desire)

3. **Balance of Opposites**: Shiva represents the union of opposites â€“ creation and destruction, asceticism and family life

4. **Spiritual Awakening**: The lingam symbolizes the infinite cosmic column of fire, representing the infinite nature of Shiva
