Meditation (dhyana) is a cornerstone of Hindu spiritual practice, representing one of the most ancient and refined systems of consciousness exploration in human history. Far from being a single technique, Hindu meditation encompasses diverse approaches tailored to different temperaments, goals, and stages of spiritual development. These practices share the common aim of stilling the fluctuations of the mind to reveal deeper states of awareness and ultimately, the true nature of reality.
