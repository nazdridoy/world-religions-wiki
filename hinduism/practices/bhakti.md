Bhakti refers to the practice of devotional worship in Hinduism, characterized by personal, loving devotion to a chosen deity. The term comes from the Sanskrit root "bhaj," meaning "to share in" or "to belong to," reflecting the intimate relationship between devotee and deity that is central to this practice.

## Historical Development

### Vedic Roots and Evolution

While elements of devotional practices appear in the earliest Vedic texts, bhakti as a prominent spiritual path emerged fully during the middle of the first millennium CE. Early expressions of bhakti can be found in:

- The Shvetashvatara Upanishad, which emphasizes devotion to Rudra (Shiva)
- The Bhagavad Gita, which presents bhakti as one of the primary paths to liberation
- The Puranas, which contain numerous devotional stories and hymns

### Bhakti Movement

The Bhakti Movement (roughly 7th-17th centuries CE) revolutionized religious practice across India:

- In South India, the Alvars (Vaishnava) and Nayanars (Shaiva) poet-saints composed devotional hymns in Tamil
- In North and Central India, poet-saints like Kabir, Tulsidas, Mirabai, and Surdas made bhakti accessible to ordinary people
- These movements often challenged caste distinctions and ritual orthodoxy, emphasizing direct communion with the divine

## Core Elements of Bhakti

The Bhagavata Purana outlines nine primary forms of bhakti:

1. **Shravana** - Listening to stories and glories of the divine
