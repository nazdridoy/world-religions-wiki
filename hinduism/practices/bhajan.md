![Bhajan singers with instruments](bhajan_performance.jpg)

Bhajan (भजन) refers to devotional songs in Hinduism that express love and longing for the divine. The term derives from the Sanskrit root "bhaj," meaning "to share, to participate, to worship." Bhajans form a central part of Hindu devotional practice, providing an accessible and emotionally engaging way to connect with the divine through music.

## Origins and Development

### Historical Roots

While devotional singing has existed in India since Vedic times, bhajans as we know them today emerged primarily during the Bhakti movement (8th-17th centuries CE). This devotional renaissance swept across India, emphasizing direct, personal connection with the divine through love rather than complex rituals or philosophical understanding.

### Medieval Flourishing

The great Bhakti saints composed countless bhajans that remain popular today:
- Mirabai's love songs to Krishna
- Surdas's devotional poetry to the child Krishna
- Tulsidas's compositions on Rama
- Kabir's spiritual verses transcending religious boundaries
- Narsinh Mehta's Vaishnava bhajans from Gujarat
- Tyagaraja's Carnatic compositions to Rama
- Purandaradasa's Kannada songs to Krishna

### Modern Evolution

In the 19th and 20th centuries, bhajans were further popularized by spiritual figures like:
- Swami Vivekananda
- Paramahansa Yogananda
- Anandamayi Ma
- Swami Sivananda

The advent of recording technology and radio broadcasting in the 20th century helped bhajans reach wider audiences, while Bollywood films incorporated devotional songs that became widely popular.
