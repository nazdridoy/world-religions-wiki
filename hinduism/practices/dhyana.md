Dhyana (ध्यान) is the Sanskrit term for meditation and contemplation, representing one of the most profound spiritual practices in Hinduism. It involves the cultivation of focused attention and awareness, ultimately leading to higher states of consciousness and spiritual realization.

## Historical Development

### Vedic Origins

Meditation practices have deep roots in Hindu tradition:

- **Early References**: Mentioned in the Rigveda and other Vedic texts (c. 1500-500 BCE)
- **Upanishadic Meditation**: Elaborated in the Upanishads as a means to realize Brahman
- **Systematic Development**: Formalized in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (c. 400-200 BCE)
- **Medieval Evolution**: Further refined in Tantric and Hatha Yoga traditions
- **Modern Practice**: Adapted for contemporary spiritual and wellness applications

### Etymology and Meaning

The term "dhyana" has significant linguistic and conceptual dimensions:

- **Sanskrit Root**: Derived from "dhi" meaning "thought, reflection, meditation"
- **Related Concepts**: 
  - Evolved into "Chan" in Chinese Buddhism
  - Transformed to "Zen" in Japanese tradition
  - Similar to "jhana" in Pali (Buddhist) texts
- **Conceptual Meaning**: State of absorption where the meditator becomes one with the object of meditation

## Dhyana in Classical Texts

### Patanjali's Yoga Sutras

In the classical eightfold path (Ashtanga Yoga), dhyana occupies a central position:

1. Yama (ethical restraints)
2. Niyama (observances)
3. Asana (posture)
4. Pranayama (breath control)
5. Pratyahara (sense withdrawal)
6. Dharana (concentration)
7. **Dhyana (meditation)**
8. Samadhi (absorption)

Dhyana is defined as "the continuous flow of cognition toward the object" (Yoga Sutra 3.2), distinguished from dharana (concentration on a single point) and samadhi (complete absorption).

### Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita dedicates Chapter 6 to the yoga of meditation:

- Describes the ideal conditions and posture for meditation
- Emphasizes equanimity and one-pointedness of mind
- Presents meditation as a means to realize the Self and achieve union with the Divine
- Outlines the path of the "yukta" (one established in yoga)

### Upanishads

Various Upanishads elaborate on meditative techniques:

- **Mandukya Upanishad**: Describes four states of consciousness (waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and turiya)
