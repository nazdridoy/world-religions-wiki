Vivaha (विवाह) refers to the sacred institution of marriage in Hinduism, encompassing an elaborate series of rituals and ceremonies that unite not just two individuals but two families. Considered one of the most important samskaras (life-cycle ceremonies), vivaha is regarded as a religious duty that fulfills spiritual, social, and emotional needs.

## Significance and Purpose

Hindu marriage is viewed as both a sacrament (samskara) and a social contract, serving multiple purposes:

- **Dharma**: Fulfillment of religious and social obligations
- **Praja**: Continuation of family lineage through procreation
- **Rati**: Fulfillment of physical desires within a sanctified relationship
- **Spiritual Growth**: A partnership for mutual spiritual development
- **Social Stability**: Foundation for family and community structure

The Manusmriti identifies eight forms of marriage, though most contemporary Hindu marriages follow the Brahma vivaha form (gift of a daughter to a man of good character).

## Pre-Wedding Rituals

Hindu marriages involve numerous ceremonies that often begin long before the wedding day:

### Matrimonial Selection

- **Traditional Method**: Family-arranged matches based on compatibility of gotra (clan), horoscopes, family background, and character
- **Contemporary Approach**: May involve the prospective bride and groom in the selection process
- **Jyotisha Consultation**: Matching of birth charts (kundali) to ensure compatibility

### Formal Engagement Ceremonies

- **Vagdana**: Verbal commitment between families
- **Tilak**: Marking the groom's forehead, symbolizing his selection as the bride-to-be's husband
- **Sagai/Nischayam**: Exchange of rings or gifts, formalizing the engagement
- **Roka/Thaka**: Ceremony officially prohibiting the families from accepting other marriage proposals

## Main Wedding Ceremonies
