Karma Yoga is one of the four primary spiritual paths in Hinduism, centered on the principle of selfless action performed without attachment to results. The term comes from the Sanskrit words "karma" (action) and "yoga" (union), indicating the practice of attaining spiritual liberation through right action in the world.

## Core Principles

### Philosophical Foundation

Karma Yoga is grounded in several fundamental principles:

- **Selfless Action**: Performing duties without personal attachment to outcomes
- **Non-attachment**: Acting without desire for the fruits of action (nishkama karma)
- **Dharma**: Fulfilling one's righteous duties according to one's position in life
- **Sacrifice**: Offering one's actions as service to the divine
- **Equanimity**: Maintaining balance in success and failure, pleasure and pain

### Historical Development

The concepts underlying Karma Yoga have evolved throughout Hindu history:

- **Vedic Origins**: Early forms appear in the concept of yajna (sacrifice) in Vedic rituals
- **Bhagavad Gita Formulation**: Most clearly articulated in Krishna's teachings to Arjuna
- **Integration with Other Paths**: Often combined with bhakti, jnana, and raja yoga
- **Modern Applications**: Adapted to contemporary social service and humanitarian work

## Karma Yoga in the Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita provides the most comprehensive exposition of Karma Yoga:

### Key Verses

- "You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work" (Chapter 2, Verse 47)
- "Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself â€“ without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat" (Chapter 2, Verse 48)
- "Established in Yoga, perform actions abandoning attachment, remaining the same in success and failure; such evenness of mind is called Yoga" (Chapter 2, Verse 48)
- "Yoga is skill in action" (Chapter 2, Verse 50)

### Three Types of Action

According to the Bhagavad Gita, actions can be categorized as:

1. **Sattvic Action**: Actions performed out of duty, without attachment, and for the welfare of all
2. **Rajasic Action**: Actions performed with egoistic motives and desire for results
3. **Tamasic Action**: Actions performed out of delusion, without concern for consequences

## Practical Application

### The Process of Karma Yoga

Practicing Karma Yoga involves:

1. **Right Attitude**: Approaching work as worship or offering
2. **Right Action**: Performing actions with full attention and excellence
3. **Right Detachment**: Surrendering concern for results while maintaining effort
4. **Right Purpose**: Working for the welfare of all beings

### Everyday Practice

Karma Yoga can be applied in various contexts:

- **Professional Work**: Performing one's occupation with dedication and service orientation
- **Family Responsibilities**: Fulfilling duties to family members without expectation
- **Community Service**: Volunteering and supporting social causes
- **Environmental Stewardship**: Taking responsibility for one's impact on the natural world
- **Spiritual Practice**: Incorporating service into one's spiritual routine

### Key Attitudes

Successful Karma Yoga involves cultivating:
