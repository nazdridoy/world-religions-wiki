Pumsavana is one of the sixteen samskaras (sacraments) in Hinduism, traditionally performed in the third month of pregnancy. The term "pumsavana" is derived from Sanskrit, where "pum" means "male" and "savana" means "generating," though in contemporary practice it is performed for the health and well-being of the child regardless of gender.
