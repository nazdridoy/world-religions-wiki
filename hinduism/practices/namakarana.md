Namakarana (नामकरण) is one of the sixteen essential samskaras (life-cycle rituals) in Hinduism. The term derives from the Sanskrit words "nama" (name) and "karana" (to make or create), and it refers to the ceremonial naming of a child. This auspicious ceremony not only provides the child with a formal identity but is also believed to influence the child's character, destiny, and future prospects.

## Significance and Purpose

The Namakarana ceremony serves several important functions in Hindu society:

- **Spiritual Identity**: Establishes the child's formal spiritual identity
- **Divine Protection**: Places the child under the protection of a chosen deity
- **Character Development**: The name chosen is believed to shape the child's personality and qualities
- **Family Integration**: Formally introduces the child to the extended family and community
- **Blessing Invocation**: Invites divine blessings for the child's well-being and future success
- **Astrological Alignment**: Ensures harmony between the child's name and cosmic influences

## Traditional Timing

The timing of the Namakarana ceremony is considered important:

- **Classical Prescription**: According to ancient texts like the Grihya Sutras, the ceremony should take place on the 10th, 11th, 12th, or 101st day after birth
- **Regional Variations**: 
  - North India: Commonly performed on the 11th day after birth
  - South India: Often performed on the 11th day for boys and 12th day for girls
  - Some communities: Performed after the first month or even later
