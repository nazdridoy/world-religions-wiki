![Person performing namaskaram greeting](namaskaram_greeting.jpg)

Namaskaram (or Namaskar, Namaste) is the traditional Hindu form of greeting and showing respect. This practice involves joining the palms together in front of the chest or forehead, sometimes accompanied by a slight bow. Beyond a simple greeting, it represents a profound spiritual and philosophical concept of acknowledging the divine in another person.

## Etymology and Meaning

The term has several variations across Indian languages:
- **Namaskaram** (Sanskrit/South Indian languages)
- **Namaste** (Hindi)
- **Namaskar** (Bengali, Marathi)
- **Vanakkam** (Tamil)

The word derives from the Sanskrit roots:
- "Namas" - meaning bow, obeisance, or reverential salutation
- "Kara" - meaning action or deed

Together, they form "Namaskara," signifying the act of paying respect or reverence.

## Spiritual Significance

### The Divine Recognition

The core philosophical concept behind namaskaram is:
- Acknowledging the divine presence (atman/soul) within the person being greeted
- Recognizing that the same divine essence exists within oneself
- Expressing the Hindu concept that "the divine in me bows to the divine in you"

### Traditional Interpretation

The full meaning is often expressed as:
> "The divine light in me bows to the divine light in you."

This reflects the Vedantic principle that all beings share the same universal soul or Brahman.
