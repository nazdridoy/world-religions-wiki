Nag Panchami is a traditional Hindu festival dedicated to the worship of snakes or serpents (nagas). Observed primarily in India and Nepal, this ancient festival reflects the cultural significance of snakes in Hindu mythology and their symbolism of fertility, death, and rebirth.

## Overview

## Historical and Religious Significance

Snake worship has ancient roots in Indian culture, predating formal Hinduism and possibly originating in the Indus Valley Civilization. The festival is associated with several mythological stories:

### Mythological Origins

1. **Krishna and Kaliya**: Celebrates Krishna's victory over the poisonous serpent Kaliya in the Yamuna river
2. **The Ocean Churning (Samudra Manthan)**: Honors Vasuki, the snake who served as the churning rope
3. **Shesha Naga**: Commemorates the cosmic serpent on whom Lord Vishnu rests
4. **Protection from Snake Bites**: The festival coincides with the monsoon season when snakes are more likely to emerge from their flooded habitats

According to the Puranas, snakes are considered the descendants of Kadru, wife of sage Kashyapa. Snake gods like Ananta, Vasuki, and Takshaka hold significant positions in Hindu cosmology.
