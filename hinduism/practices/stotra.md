# Stotra - Hymns and Sacred Prayers

![Ancient Sanskrit stotra manuscript](stotra_manuscript.jpg)

Stotra (स्तोत्र) refers to devotional hymns and prayers in Hindu tradition that praise and invoke deities. The word comes from the Sanskrit root "stu" meaning "to praise" or "to eulogize." These sacred compositions form an essential part of Hindu worship, encompassing everything from simple prayers to complex literary masterpieces.

## Origins and Development

### Vedic Roots

The tradition of stotras can be traced back to the Vedic period (1500-500 BCE). The Rigveda, Hinduism's oldest text, contains numerous hymns (suktas) praising various deities, which are considered the earliest forms of stotras. The famous Purusha Sukta, Nasadiya Sukta, and Sri Sukta are notable examples.

### Classical Evolution

While Vedic hymns were primarily meant for ritual recitation by priests, later stotras evolved to be more accessible to the general population. During the Puranic period (300-1000 CE), stotras became more devotional and emotional in nature, focusing on personal connection with deities rather than elaborate ritual formulas.

### Medieval Flowering

The greatest flowering of stotra literature occurred during the Bhakti movement (8th-17th centuries CE), when poet-saints across India composed innumerable devotional works in both Sanskrit and regional languages. Saints like Adi Shankaracharya, Jayadeva, and the Alvars produced some of the most beloved stotras still recited today.

## Characteristics and Structure

Stotras typically follow specific poetic structures:
- Composed in metrical verse (chandas)
