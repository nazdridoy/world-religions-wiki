# Pradakshina - Ritual Circumambulation

![Pradakshina around a temple](pradakshina_image.jpg)

Pradakshina is the ritual practice of circumambulation in Hinduism, where devotees walk clockwise around a sacred object, deity, or structure as an act of reverence and worship. The term comes from Sanskrit: "pra" meaning forward and "dakshina" meaning right, referring to keeping the sacred object on one's right side while walking around it.

## Origins and Significance

Pradakshina is one of the oldest forms of worship in Hinduism, with references found in ancient texts including the Vedas and Puranas. It symbolizes several spiritual concepts:

- The cyclical nature of existence and the cosmos
- Recognition of the deity as the center of one's life
- Moving from darkness to light (clockwise motion follows the sun's path)
- External expression of inner surrender
- Symbolic journey around the entire universe (as the sacred object represents the cosmos)

As a devotee performs pradakshina, they absorb the spiritual energy emanating from the sacred center while simultaneously demonstrating their devotion.

## Procedure and Practice

### Basic Elements

A proper pradakshina incorporates several elements:
- Clockwise movement (keeping the deity/sacred object on one's right)
- Maintaining a meditative or prayerful state
- Walking barefoot as a sign of humility
- Moving at a moderate, respectful pace
- Observing silence or chanting mantras
- Hands in prayer position (anjali mudra) or specific ritual gestures

### Number of Circumambulations

The number of times one circles the sacred object often has symbolic significance:
- **One** - Represents the unity of the individual soul and the supreme soul
- **Three** - Signifies the three gunas (qualities of nature: sattva, rajas, tamas)
- **Four** - Represents the four Vedas or four yugas (cosmic ages)
- **Seven** - Symbolizes the seven chakras or seven worlds
- **Nine** - Represents the nine planets or the nine forms of devotion
- **108** - Considered highly auspicious, representing the 108 Upanishads or the 108 sacred names of the deity

For everyday worship, 3, 7, or 11 pradakshinas are most common.

## Types of Pradakshina

### Based on Sacred Objects

#### Temple Pradakshina
Circumambulation of an entire temple structure, often following a specific covered pathway called a pradakshina path. Many Hindu temples are designed with this pathway around the central sanctum.

#### Deity Pradakshina
Circumambulation directly around the main deity or shrine within a temple.

#### Sacred Fire (Agni) Pradakshina
Walking around a sacred fire during ceremonies such as weddings and yajnas (fire sacrifices).

#### Sacred Plants Pradakshina
Circumambulation around sacred trees or plants, particularly the Tulsi (holy basil) plant, Peepal tree, or Banyan tree.

#### Mountain Pradakshina
Circumambulation of sacred mountains or hills, such as Mount Kailash (associated with Lord Shiva) or Arunachala hill in Tamil Nadu.

### Based on Method

#### Inner Pradakshina
Mental or meditative circumambulation practiced when physical pradakshina is not possible.

#### Aatma Pradakshina
Self-circumambulation, a special form where one rotates in place, symbolizing that divinity resides within oneself.

#### Sashtanga Pradakshina
Performed by prostrating fully at each step, an extremely devoted form requiring hours or days to complete even a single circumambulation.

## Pradakshina in Different Traditions

### Shaivite Traditions

In Shaivism, pradakshina around the Shiva Lingam is considered highly meritorious. The Skanda Purana states that walking around the Lingam destroys sins from previous lifetimes. At sacred sites like Varanasi, devotees perform special pradakshinas along the Panchakroshi route around the entire city.

### Vaishnava Traditions

Vaishnavas perform pradakshina around temples of Vishnu and his avatars. The Tulsi plant is also circumambulated daily by many devotees. The sacred city of Vrindavan (associated with Krishna) has a traditional 21-mile pradakshina path called the Vrindavan Parikrama.

### Shakta Traditions

In goddess worship, pradakshina around the various forms of the Divine Mother is practiced. Special circumambulations of sacred sites like Kamakhya Temple include walking around the entire hill on which the temple stands.

## Regional and Temple-Specific Practices

### South Indian Traditions

South Indian temples often feature elaborate pradakshina paths with multiple circumambulation routes. The outer pradakshina may include carvings, paintings, and shrines of secondary deities, while inner pradakshinas bring devotees closer to the main deity.

### North Indian Traditions

In North India, pradakshina is often integrated with parikrama (pilgrimage) traditions, where devotees circumambulate entire sacred cities or regions, such as the Govardhan Hill parikrama near Mathura.

### Famous Pradakshina Routes

- **Arunachala Girivalam**: The 14 km circumambulation of Arunachala Hill in Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu
- **Mount Kailash Parikrama**: The arduous 52 km circuit around Mount Kailash in Tibet
- **Narmada Parikrama**: The massive 2,600 km circumambulation of the entire Narmada River
- **Govardhan Parikrama**: The 21 km path around Govardhan Hill associated with Krishna

## Spiritual Benefits

Devotees believe pradakshina offers numerous spiritual and material benefits:

- Purification of mind and body
- Removal of sins and negative karma
- Enhancement of spiritual energy
- Development of concentration and one-pointedness
- Alignment with cosmic rhythms
- Blessings for health, prosperity, and spiritual progress
- Gradual dissolution of ego

## Philosophical Symbolism

From a philosophical perspective, pradakshina represents:

- The journey of the soul around the divine center of existence
- The continuous cycle of birth and death (samsara)
- The process of moving from the outer (material) to the inner (spiritual)
- Recognition that all life revolves around the divine principle
- Integration of physical movement with spiritual intention

## Contemporary Practice

Today, pradakshina remains a central practice in Hindu temples worldwide. Modern Hindu communities have adapted the practice in various ways:

- Scheduled group pradakshinas at fixed times in major temples
- Abbreviated pradakshina practices for busy devotees
- Virtual pradakshina through video and online platforms
- Educational programs explaining the symbolism to younger generations
