# Ahimsa - Non-Violence in Hindu Tradition

![Symbol of Ahimsa](ahimsa_symbol.jpg)

Ahimsa, or non-violence, is a fundamental ethical principle in Hinduism that advocates avoiding harm to any living being in thought, word, and deed. The concept extends beyond physical violence to encompass all forms of harmful intentions and actions, making it one of the most comprehensive ethical precepts in Hindu philosophy.

## Definition and Etymology

The term "ahimsa" is derived from Sanskrit:
- "a" (prefix indicating negation)
- "himsa" (harm, injury, or violence)

Together, these create a term that literally means "non-harm" or "absence of violence."

## Philosophical Foundations

### In Hindu Darshanas (Philosophical Schools)

Ahimsa is a cornerstone ethical principle across various Hindu philosophical systems:

- **Yoga**: In Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, ahimsa is the first and most important of the five yamas (moral restraints)
- **Samkhya**: Recognizes ahimsa as consistent with its understanding of consciousness
- **Vedanta**: Interprets ahimsa as recognition of the unity of all beings
- **Nyaya-Vaisheshika**: Includes ahimsa among the virtues necessary for ethical living

### Metaphysical Basis

The principle of ahimsa is rooted in several fundamental Hindu concepts:

- **Atman (Soul)**: The belief that all living beings contain the same divine essence
- **Karma**: The understanding that causing harm generates negative consequences
- **Samsara**: The cycle of rebirth means that other beings may have been related to us in past lives
- **Dharma**: Non-violence is an essential component of righteous living
