# Smarta Practices

Smarta practices comprise a set of rituals, ceremonies, and spiritual disciplines that characterize Smartism, one of the four major denominations within Hinduism. Founded by the philosopher Adi Shankaracharya (8th century CE), Smartism is known for its liberal approach that incorporates the worship of multiple deities equally, while philosophically adhering to Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism).

## Core Devotional Practices

### Panchayatana Puja

The defining characteristic of Smarta worship is the Panchayatana Puja, which involves the worship of five deities:

- **Surya** (Sun God) - Representing cosmic energy
- **Vishnu** - The preserver deity
- **Shiva** - The transformer deity
- **Ganesha** - The remover of obstacles
- **Devi** (Goddess, often as Parvati) - The divine feminine power

Alternatively, some Smartas replace Surya with **Skanda** (Kartikeya).

#### Features of Panchayatana Worship:

- **Central Deity**: One deity is installed in the center according to personal preference (Ishta Devata)
- **Equal Reverence**: All five deities receive equal respect and offerings
