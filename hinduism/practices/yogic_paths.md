Yoga in Hinduism represents far more than the physical exercise system popularized globally. At its core, yoga (from the Sanskrit root *yuj*, meaning "to yoke" or "to unite") encompasses a diverse set of spiritual and ascetic practices designed to integrate mind, body, and spirit to achieve union with the divine. These various approaches, known as yogic paths or margas, offer different methodologies suited to different temperaments and goals, all ultimately leading toward moksha (liberation).
