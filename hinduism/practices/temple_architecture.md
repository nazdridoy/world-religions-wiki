# Hindu Temple Architecture

![Hindu temple architectural diagram](temple_architecture_diagram.jpg)

Hindu temple architecture represents one of the most significant expressions of Indian religious art and spiritual philosophy. More than just buildings for worship, temples are considered the earthly dwelling places of deities and symbolic representations of the cosmos. Their design follows precise rules codified in ancient texts, with variations across regions and historical periods.

## Philosophical Foundation

### Symbolic Meaning

- **Journey Symbolism**: Movement through the temple represents spiritual progression

### Theological Concepts

- **Deity's Presence**: The sanctum (garbhagriha) houses the divine presence
- **Sacred Geography**: Temples recreate cosmic geography in microcosm
- **Liminal Space**: Temples serve as thresholds between human and divine realms
