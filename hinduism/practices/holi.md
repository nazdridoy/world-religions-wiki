Holi (होली) is a vibrant and joyous Hindu festival celebrated primarily in India and Nepal, but now embraced in many parts of the world. Known as the "Festival of Colors" or the "Festival of Love," Holi marks the arrival of spring, the end of winter, and celebrates the triumph of good over evil. Characterized by its exuberant throwing of colored powders and water, Holi breaks down social barriers and brings communities together in a spirit of equality and camaraderie.

## Origins and Mythology

Holi's origins are tied to several Hindu legends, with different stories emphasized in different regions:

### Holika and Prahlad

The most widespread legend associated with Holi involves Holika and Prahlad:

- King Hiranyakashipu, who considered himself godlike, demanded everyone worship him
- His son Prahlad remained devoted to Lord Vishnu instead
- The king's sister Holika, who had a blessing that made her immune to fire, sat with Prahlad in a burning pyre, intending to kill him
- Due to Prahlad's devotion, Holika's blessing was nullified, and she burned while Prahlad emerged unharmed
- The burning of Holika is celebrated as Holika Dahan on the eve of Holi

### Krishna and Radha

Another popular legend connects Holi to Lord Krishna:

- Young Krishna, whose skin had turned blue after drinking the poisoned milk of the demoness Putana, was concerned that fair-skinned Radha would not accept him
- Krishna's mother suggested he playfully apply color to Radha's face
- Krishna did so, and this playful coloring became a beloved tradition
- This association explains why Holi is celebrated with particular enthusiasm in the regions of Mathura, Vrindavan, and Barsana where Krishna spent his childhood
