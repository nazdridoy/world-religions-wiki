# Mantra in Hinduism

![Sanskrit mantra inscription](mantra_inscription.jpg)

Mantras form one of the most distinctive and powerful elements of Hindu spiritual practice. These sacred sound formulas, ranging from single syllables to extensive verses, are considered more than mere words—they are sonic embodiments of cosmic principles and divine energies. The term "mantra" itself derives from the Sanskrit roots *man* (mind) and *tra* (tool or instrument), signifying "instrument of thought" or "tool for the mind." Throughout Hindu tradition, mantras serve as vehicles for spiritual transformation, worship, protection, and the transmission of spiritual knowledge.
