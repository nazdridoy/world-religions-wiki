![Ayurvedic herbs and preparations](ayurveda_herbs.jpg)

Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest holistic healing systems, developed more than 3,000 years ago in India. It remains one of India's traditional health care systems and has deeply influenced many other healing traditions worldwide. The word "Ayurveda" derives from Sanskrit, where "ayur" means life and "veda" means knowledge or science.

## Core Principles

### Philosophical Foundation

- **Holistic Approach**: Ayurveda treats the whole person—body, mind, senses, emotions, and spirit—not just symptoms
- **Balance of Doshas**: Health exists when there is harmony between the three fundamental bodily bio-elements or doshas
- **Integration with Hindu Cosmology**: Based on the same philosophical foundations as other aspects of Hindu tradition
- **Preventative Focus**: Emphasis on lifestyle and daily routines to prevent disease before it manifests

### The Three Doshas

The three doshas (biological energies found throughout the human body and mind) are:

1. **Vata**: Composed of space and air elements; governs movement and nervous system
2. **Pitta**: Composed of fire and water elements; governs digestion, metabolism, and transformation
3. **Kapha**: Composed of earth and water elements; governs structure, stability, and lubrication

Each person has a unique proportion of these three doshas, called their constitution or Prakriti. Imbalances in this constitution lead to illness.

## Historical Development

### Vedic Origins

Ayurveda's earliest concepts appear in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda (1500-1000 BCE), which contain hymns and incantations for treating various ailments. The Atharvaveda particularly contains many magical spells for countering disease and healing various afflictions.

### Classical Period

Around 1000 BCE, Ayurveda evolved into a more systematic form with the composition of the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita, the foundational texts of Ayurveda:

- **Charaka Samhita**: Focused on internal medicine (Kaya Chikitsa)
- **Sushruta Samhita**: Emphasized surgical techniques and procedures (Shalya Tantra)

### Medieval Developments

- 7th-8th centuries CE: Vagbhata compiled the Ashtanga Hridaya, synthesizing earlier works
- Regional schools and specialized texts developed, particularly in Kerala and Tamil Nadu
- Integration with Tantric and yogic practices

### Colonial Impact and Revival

- Decline during British colonial rule when Western medicine was promoted
- Revival since Indian independence as part of cultural heritage
- Modern scientific studies on various Ayurvedic treatments and medicines

## Eight Branches of Ayurveda

Classical Ayurveda is divided into eight specialized branches:

1. **Kayachikitsa**: General medicine and internal diseases
2. **Shalakya Tantra**: Diseases of the head and neck, including eyes, ears, nose, and throat
3. **Shalya Tantra**: Surgery and extraction of foreign objects
4. **Agada Tantra**: Toxicology and purification from poisons
5. **Bhuta Vidya**: Management of psychological and spiritual disorders
6. **Kaumarabhritya**: Pediatrics, including prenatal and postnatal care
7. **Rasayana**: Rejuvenation and anti-aging therapies
8. **Vajikarana**: Reproductive health and aphrodisiacs

Ayurvedic practitioners use eight primary methods of diagnosis (Ashtavidha Pariksha):

1. **Nadi** (pulse examination)
2. **Mootra** (urine examination)
3. **Mala** (stool examination)
4. **Jihva** (tongue examination)
5. **Shabda** (speech and voice quality)
