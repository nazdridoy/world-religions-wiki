## Mythology and Stories

### Origin and Rudra Connection

In early Vedic texts, Shiva is associated with Rudra, a fierce storm deity. Over time, Rudra-Shiva evolved into the more complex deity worshipped today. Some scholars see indications of Shiva worship dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization.

### The Blue-Throated One (Neelakantha)

When the cosmic ocean was churned by gods and demons seeking amrita (the nectar of immortality), a deadly poison emerged first. To save the universe, Shiva swallowed the poison but held it in his throat, which turned blueâ€”hence the name Neelakantha, "the blue-throated one."

### Third Eye

Shiva's third eye represents wisdom and insight. When opened, it can emit flames that reduce everything to ashes, symbolizing the destruction of ignorance and ego.

### Family Life

Shiva's first wife was Sati, who immolated herself after her father insulted Shiva. She was later reborn as Parvati. Their children include:
- Ganesha - The elephant-headed god of beginnings
- Kartikeya (also called Murugan) - The god of war
- Ashokasundari - Their daughter in some traditions

## Worship and Temples

Shiva is one of the most widely worshipped deities in Hinduism. Devotees of Shiva are called Shaivites, and they follow the tradition known as Shaivism.

Major temples dedicated to Shiva include:
- Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi
- Kedarnath Temple in Uttarakhand
- Brihadeeswara Temple in Thanjavur
- The Jyotirlinga temples (12 sacred sites)

## Shiva in Hindu Denominations

- **Shaivism**: Considers Shiva as the supreme deity
- **Smartism**: Worships Shiva as one of the five primary forms of God
- **Vaishnavism**: Acknowledges Shiva while considering Vishnu supreme
- **Shaktism**: Often portrays Shiva alongside the supreme Goddess as her consort

## Shaivite Philosophy

Shaivite philosophy encompasses several schools of thought, including:
- **Kashmir Shaivism**: Non-dualistic tradition focusing on consciousness
- **Shaiva Siddhanta**: Dualistic system popular in South India
- **Pashupata Shaivism**: One of the oldest ascetic Shaivite movements
- **Lingayatism**: Reform movement rejecting caste distinctions

## Ascetic Associations

Shiva is the patron deity of yogis, ascetics, and renunciants. He embodies the ideal of detachment from worldly concerns while remaining engaged in cosmic play (lila).
