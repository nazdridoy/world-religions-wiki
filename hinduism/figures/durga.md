## Mythology and Stories

### Creation of Durga

The most famous origin story of Durga comes from the Devi Mahatmya, part of the Markandeya Purana. When the buffalo demon Mahishasura, who could not be defeated by any male deity due to a boon, wreaked havoc in the cosmos, the gods combined their energies to create a supreme goddess. From Shiva came her face, from Vishnu her arms, from Agni her fiery heat, and so on from all the gods. Thus emerged Durga, equipped with weapons from each deity, as the embodiment of combined divine power.

### Battle with Mahishasura

Upon her creation, Durga engaged in a fierce battle with Mahishasura and his demonic forces. After days of combat, she finally killed the shape-shifting demon when he had assumed the form of a buffalo, by piercing his chest with her trident and beheading him with her sword. This victory is the source of one of her most common epithets, "Mahishasuramardini" (Slayer of Mahishasura).

### Nine Forms of Durga (Navadurga)

During Navaratri (the nine-night festival), nine forms of Durga are worshipped:
1. **Shailaputri** - The daughter of the mountains
2. **Brahmacharini** - The one who practices divine austerity
3. **Chandraghanta** - The one with the moon bell
4. **Kushmanda** - The one who created the universe
5. **Skandamata** - Mother of Skanda (Kartikeya)
6. **Katyayani** - The daughter of sage Katyayana
7. **Kalaratri** - The dark night of destruction
8. **Mahagauri** - The extremely fair one
9. **Siddhidatri** - The bestower of mystic powers
