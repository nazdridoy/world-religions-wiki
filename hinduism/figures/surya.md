## Mythology and Stories

### Origin and Birth

In Hindu mythology, Surya is considered one of the eight Adityas, sons of the goddess Aditi and sage Kashyapa. He is sometimes described as emerging during the churning of the cosmic ocean (Samudra Manthan), though his existence is generally considered primordial, predating even that event. Surya is also sometimes identified with Brahma for his role in creation through energy and light.

### Marriage and Children

Surya married Sanjana (also known as Saranyu), the daughter of Vishvakarma, the divine architect. Unable to bear his intense radiance, Sanjana created a shadow-self called Chhaya and left her with Surya while she went to perform penance. From Sanjana, Surya had several important children, including:

- Yama (the god of death)
- Yami (or Yamuna, the river goddess)
- Ashvins (divine twin physicians)
- Revanta (a minor deity associated with hunting)

From Chhaya, he fathered:
- Shani (the planet Saturn)
- Tapti (a river goddess)
- Savarni Manu (the future Manu)

### The Dimming of Surya's Radiance

When Sanjana could not bear Surya's brilliance even after her penance, her father Vishvakarma placed the sun god on a lathe and trimmed away one-eighth of his radiance. The removed energy was used to craft various divine weapons, including Vishnu's discus (Sudarshana Chakra), Shiva's trident (Trishul), and other celestial weapons.

### Surya and Hanuman

A popular story connects Surya with Hanuman. As a child, Hanuman mistook the sun for a ripe fruit and leapt up to eat it. After Indra struck Hanuman with his thunderbolt to protect Surya, the injured Hanuman was blessed by various gods. Later, Surya became Hanuman's teacher, imparting to him knowledge of the scriptures and various sciences, despite Hanuman facing the sun and constantly moving backward to maintain respectful distance.
