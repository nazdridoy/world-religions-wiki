## Mythology and Stories

### Birth and Marriage to Shiva

Parvati is believed to be the reincarnation of Sati, Shiva's first wife who immolated herself after her father Daksha insulted Shiva. Born as the daughter of the mountain king Himavan and queen Mena, Parvati was destined to reunite with Shiva.

When Shiva retreated into meditation after Sati's death, Parvati devoted herself to rigorous penance to win his attention and love. Her extraordinary devotion and austerities (tapas) eventually awakened Shiva from his meditation, and they were married.

### The Creation of Ganesha

One of the most famous stories involving Parvati tells of the creation of Ganesha. While Shiva was away, Parvati created a boy from the turmeric paste she used for her bath (or, in some versions, from the dirt of her body). She brought him to life and instructed him to guard the entrance while she bathed.

When Shiva returned, he was stopped by this strange boy who refused him entry. Enraged, Shiva beheaded the boy. Seeing Parvati's grief, Shiva promised to replace the boy's head with that of the first living creature he encountered, which happened to be an elephant. Thus, Ganesha was given new life with an elephant head.
