## Mythology and Stories

### Origin of Kali

One of the most famous origin stories comes from the Devi Mahatmya. When the goddess Durga was battling the demons Chanda and Munda, she became so enraged that her face turned black and Kali sprang forth from her forehead. With wild eyes, gaping mouth, and protruding tongue, Kali ferociously slaughtered the demons.

In another prominent story, when the demon Raktabija fought against the goddess, every drop of his blood that touched the ground produced a clone of him. To defeat him, Kali spread her tongue across the battlefield to consume every drop of blood before it could create more demons, thus preventing their multiplication.

### Kali and Shiva

The most iconic imagery of Kali shows her standing or dancing upon the body of Shiva, who lies still beneath her. This represents several philosophical concepts:

- The dynamic feminine energy (Shakti) operating upon the static masculine consciousness (Shiva)
- The play of active creation and destruction upon the backdrop of unchanging awareness
- The awakening of Kali from her destructive frenzy when she realizes she is trampling her consort

According to legend, Kali became so intoxicated with the destruction of demons that she began destroying everything in her path. To stop her rampage, Shiva lay down at her feet. When she stepped on him, she came to her senses, stuck out her tongue in embarrassment, and stopped her destruction.
