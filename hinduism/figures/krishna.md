## Mythology and Stories

### Birth and Early Life

Krishna was born in Mathura to Devaki and Vasudeva while his maternal uncle Kamsa was king. Before his birth, a divine prophecy foretold that Devaki's eighth child would kill Kamsa. Fearing for his life, Kamsa imprisoned the couple and killed their first seven children. When Krishna was born, divine intervention helped Vasudeva secretly carry the baby across the Yamuna River to Gokul, where he was raised by foster parents Yashoda and Nanda.

### Childhood and Youth (Bal Krishna)

Krishna's childhood in Gokul and Vrindavan is celebrated for its playfulness and mischief. Famous childhood episodes include:
- Butter thief (makhan chor) - stealing butter from neighbors' homes
- Defeating the serpent Kaliya in the Yamuna River
- Lifting Govardhan Hill with one finger to shelter villagers from torrential rains sent by Indra
- Various lilas (divine plays) with the gopis (cowherd girls) and gopas (cowherd boys)

### Relationship with Radha

The relationship between Krishna and Radha represents the highest form of divine love (prema) in Hindu tradition. Though not mentioned in the earliest texts about Krishna, Radha emerged as Krishna's primary consort in later devotional literature. Their love symbolizes the soul's longing for union with the divine.

### The Bhagavad Gita

One of the most significant episodes involving Krishna occurs on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where he served as charioteer to the Pandava prince Arjuna during the Mahabharata war. When Arjuna hesitates to fight against his own relatives, Krishna delivers the philosophical discourse known as the Bhagavad Gita, revealing his cosmic form (Vishvarupa) and teaching about duty (dharma), devotion (bhakti), knowledge (jnana), and selfless action (karma yoga).

### Later Life

After the Mahabharata war, Krishna established his kingdom at Dwarka on the western coast of India. He married many princesses, including Rukmini, Satyabhama, and Jambavati, often rescuing them from difficult situations. After ruling for many years, he departed from the earthly realm when a hunter named Jara mistakenly shot him in the heel—his only vulnerable spot—with an arrow.

## Worship and Religious Significance

### In Gaudiya Vaishnavism

Founded by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (15th century), this tradition considers Krishna as the supreme manifestation of the divine. His relationship with Radha is central to their theology, representing the highest expression of divine love. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) belongs to this tradition.
