## Mythology and Stories

### Birth and Childhood

According to Hindu mythology, Hanuman (also known as Anjaneya) was born to Anjana, an apsara who was born on earth due to a curse, and Kesari, a vanara (monkey) chief. However, he is also considered the son of Vayu, the wind god, who played a role in his birth through divine intervention.

As a child, Hanuman was mischievous and had extraordinary powers. Once, mistaking the sun for a ripe fruit, he leaped into the sky to catch it. This act worried Indra, the king of gods, who struck Hanuman with his thunderbolt, injuring his chin (hanu), which gave him the name "Hanuman" (one with a prominent or injured chin).

### Powers and Curses

After Hanuman was struck by Indra's thunderbolt, the wind god Vayu became angry and withdrew air from the universe. To appease Vayu, the gods blessed the young Hanuman with numerous powers:
- Brahma blessed him with wisdom and ability to control his life span
- Vishnu gave him unwavering devotion
- Shiva granted him strength and invincibility
- Indra blessed him with immunity from his thunderbolt
- Surya, the sun god, became his guru and taught him various skills

However, due to his increasing mischief, the sages placed a curse on him that made him forget his powers until reminded of them.

### Role in the Ramayana

Hanuman's most significant role is in the Ramayana, where he serves as Lord Rama's devoted ally in the search for Rama's abducted wife, Sita. Key episodes include:

1. **Meeting Rama**: As a minister of the monkey king Sugriva, Hanuman first meets Rama and his brother Lakshmana in the Kishkindha forest and recognizes them as divine beings.

2. **Leap to Lanka**: After identifying Sita's location in Lanka (current Sri Lanka), Hanuman takes a mighty leap across the ocean, overcoming numerous obstacles to reach her.

3. **Finding Sita**: In Lanka, he locates Sita in Ashok Vatika, identifies himself as Rama's messenger, and offers her comfort and Rama's ring as proof of his identity.

4. **Burning of Lanka**: Captured by Ravana's forces, Hanuman allows himself to be bound, but when his tail is set on fire as punishment, he escapes and uses his burning tail to set fire to much of Lanka.

5. **Fetching medicinal herbs**: During the war between Rama and Ravana, when Lakshmana is severely wounded, Hanuman flies to the Himalayas to fetch the life-saving Sanjeevani herb. Unable to identify the specific herb, he uproots and carries the entire mountain to the battlefield.
