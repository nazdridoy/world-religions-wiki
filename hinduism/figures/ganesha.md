## Mythology and Stories

### Birth of Ganesha

The most popular story of Ganesha's origin relates that he was created by the goddess Parvati, wife of Shiva. While Shiva was away, Parvati created Ganesha from the sandalwood paste she used for her bath, breathing life into him and appointing him to guard her door while she bathed.

When Shiva returned, he was stopped by Ganesha who did not know him. In the ensuing confrontation, Shiva beheaded Ganesha. Upon learning that he had killed Parvati's son, and witnessing her grief, Shiva promised to replace Ganesha's head with that of the first living creature he encountered, which happened to be an elephant.

### The Broken Tusk

There are several stories explaining Ganesha's broken tusk:

1. **Writing the Mahabharata**: When the sage Vyasa was dictating the Mahabharata, Ganesha served as the scribe. When his pen failed, he broke off his own tusk to continue writing without interruption, demonstrating his dedication to knowledge.

2. **Battle with Parashurama**: The warrior sage Parashurama, an avatar of Vishnu, tried to visit Shiva but was blocked by Ganesha. In the fight that followed, Parashurama threw his axe at Ganesha, who recognized it as his father's weapon and allowed it to hit his tusk out of respect.

3. **Moon's Laughter**: One night, Ganesha fell from his mount (the rat) after consuming too many sweets. The moon laughed at him, and in anger, Ganesha broke off his tusk and threw it at the moon, cursing that the moon would never be whole again (explaining the moon's phases).
