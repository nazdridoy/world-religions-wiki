## Mythology and Stories

### Origin and Birth

According to Hindu mythology, Chandra was born during the churning of the cosmic ocean (Samudra Manthan). He emerged holding the divine cup of Soma (an intoxicating elixir). In some versions, he is considered the son of sage Atri and his wife Anusuya, or alternatively, the son of Dharma (righteousness) and the daughters of Daksha.

### Chandra's Wives and the Curse

One of the most famous stories about Chandra concerns his marriages and subsequent curse. Chandra married the twenty-seven daughters of Daksha, who represent the twenty-seven Nakshatras (lunar mansions or constellations). However, he showed excessive favoritism toward Rohini, one of his wives, neglecting the others.

Angered by this neglect, the other wives complained to their father, Daksha, who cursed Chandra to suffer from consumption (waning). This explains the waxing and waning of the moon. Later, on Chandra's appeal, Daksha modified the curse to be cyclical rather than permanent, resulting in the moon's monthly cycle of waxing and waning.

### Abduction of Tara

Another significant myth involves Chandra's infatuation with Tara, the wife of Brihaspati (Jupiter/guru of the gods). Chandra abducted her, leading to a cosmic war between the devas (gods) and asuras (demons). Eventually, Lord Brahma intervened, forcing Chandra to return Tara to her husband. However, Tara had already conceived Chandra's son, who was named Budha (Mercury).

### Chandra and Ganesha

In a humorous tale, Chandra once laughed at Lord Ganesha when he fell from his mount (a rat) after eating too many sweets. Offended, Ganesha cursed Chandra that no one would look at him. Realizing the severity of this curse, Chandra apologized, and Ganesha modified the curse so that Chandra would wax and wane periodically rather than disappear completely.

## Worship and Religious Significance

### Astrological Importance

In Hindu astrology (Jyotisha), Chandra is one of the nine Navagraha, with significant influence on human lives:
- Rules over the mind and emotions
- Governs motherhood, comfort, and nurturing qualities
- Associated with Monday (Somavar)
- Rules the fourth house in the birth chart

### Rituals and Practices

- **Somavar Vrat (Monday Fast)**: Many devotees observe fasts on Mondays to please Chandra and gain his blessings
- **Milk Offerings**: As Soma (elixir) is associated with Chandra, milk is a common offering
- **Chandra Grahan (Lunar Eclipse)**: Special rituals are performed during lunar eclipses
- **Chandra Darshana**: Viewing the moon on specific occasions, especially after certain fasts

### Temples

While not as numerous as temples for deities like Shiva or Vishnu, there are temples dedicated to Chandra or where he is worshipped as part of the Navagraha:
- Chandra Prabha temple in Varanasi
- Navagraha temples in Tamil Nadu
- Somnath Temple in Gujarat (one of the twelve Jyotirlingas), associated with Soma/Chandra
- Thingaloor Chandra temple in Tamil Nadu

## Chandra in Different Traditions

### In Vedic Religion

In the earliest Vedic texts, Soma (later identified with Chandra) was more prominently worshipped as the deity of a sacred plant that produced an intoxicating ritual drink. The entire ninth book of the Rigveda is dedicated to Soma.

### In Classical Hinduism

As Hinduism evolved, Chandra became more associated with the actual celestial moon rather than just the Soma drink. His role as one of the cosmic bodies with astrological significance became more prominent.

### In Tantra and Yoga

In tantric practices and yoga, Chandra is associated with:
- The Ida nadi (left energy channel)
- The cooling lunar energy in the body
- Chandra bhedana pranayama (moon-piercing breath)
- The coolant aspect of consciousness

### In Regional Traditions

- In South India: Worshipped as part of the Navagraha temples
- In Gujarat: Associated with Somnath (one of the most ancient pilgrim centers)
- In Kashmir Shaivism: Associated with certain aspects of consciousness

## Symbolism and Philosophical Significance

Chandra embodies numerous symbolic meanings in Hindu thought:

- **Mind's Fluctuations**: His waxing and waning represent the fluctuating nature of the human mind
- **Time Cycles**: Represents the cyclical nature of time through his phases
- **Reflection**: As the moon reflects the sun's light, he symbolizes reflection rather than original illumination
- **Fertility**: Associated with plant growth, water, and reproductive cycles
- **Duality**: Represents both benefic and malefic influences depending on his placement and phase

## Chandra in Texts

Chandra appears in various Hindu scriptures:

- **Rigveda**: As Soma, with an entire book (mandala) dedicated to him

### Literature and Art
