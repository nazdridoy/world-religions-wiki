## Understanding Hindu Deities

In Hinduism, deities can be viewed in multiple ways:
1. As distinct gods with individual personalities and domains
2. As different manifestations of one supreme reality (Brahman)
3. As symbolic representations of cosmic principles

Many Hindus practice monotheism, seeing all gods as aspects of one supreme being, while others focus their devotion on particular deities (henotheism).
