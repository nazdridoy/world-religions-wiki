Rama (also known as Ramachandra) is one of the most widely revered deities in Hinduism, worshipped as the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu.

## Mythology and Stories

### Birth and Early Life

Rama was born to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya of Ayodhya, following a divine ritual performed by the sage Rishyashringa. As the eldest of four brothers (Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna), Rama was trained in the martial arts, scriptures, and royal duties. During his youth, he and his brother Lakshmana accompanied the sage Vishwamitra to protect his sacrifices from demons, displaying extraordinary valor and earning divine weapons.

### Marriage to Sita

At a swayamvara (self-choice ceremony) held by King Janaka of Mithila, Rama won the hand of Princess Sita by successfully stringing and breaking the divine bow of Lord Shiva, a feat no other king or prince could accomplish. This event cemented the alliance between the kingdoms of Kosala (Ayodhya) and Videha (Mithila).

### Exile and Abduction of Sita

On the eve of Rama's coronation as the king of Ayodhya, his stepmother Kaikeyi, influenced by her maid Manthara, demanded that King Dasharatha honor two boons he had previously promised her. She asked that Rama be exiled to the forest for fourteen years and that her son Bharata be crowned king instead. Honoring his father's promise, Rama willingly accepted exile, accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana.

During their forest exile, the demon king Ravana abducted Sita after luring Rama away from their hermitage. This led to an epic search and eventually to a great war between Rama's forces (including the monkey army led by Hanuman) and Ravana's demon forces on the island of Lanka.

### Rescue of Sita and Return to Ayodhya

After defeating and killing Ravana, Rama rescued Sita. Following a controversial fire ordeal (agni pariksha) to prove her purity, they returned to Ayodhya where Rama was crowned king. His reign, known as "Rama Rajya," is celebrated in Hindu tradition as an era of perfect peace, prosperity, and justice.

### Later Life and Ascension

According to some versions of the story, later in his reign, Rama exiled the pregnant Sita to the forest due to rumors questioning her chastity during her captivity. In the hermitage of sage Valmiki (the author of the Ramayana), she gave birth to twin sons, Lava and Kusha. Years later, when they were reunited with their father, Sita asked Mother Earth to take her back, and she disappeared into the ground. Following this, Rama eventually ended his earthly incarnation by walking into the Sarayu River.
