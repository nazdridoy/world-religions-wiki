## Mythology and Stories

### Creation of the Universe

According to Hindu mythology, Brahma emerged from a lotus that grew from the navel of Vishnu, who was resting on the cosmic serpent Shesha. Upon his emergence, Brahma began the work of creating the universe and all beings within it.

### The Four Heads

Brahma is traditionally depicted with four heads facing the four directions. According to legend, Brahma initially had five heads but lost one when Shiva, angered by Brahma's pride, cut it off. The four remaining heads represent:

1. The four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva)
2. The four stages of life (Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, and Sannyasa)
3. The four aims of life (Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha)
4. The four yugas or cosmic ages (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali)

### Curse of Brahma

One story explains why Brahma is rarely worshipped today. According to this legend, Brahma was cursed by either Shiva or his wife Saraswati for lying or inappropriate behavior. The curse stated that he would not be worshipped like other deities.

## Worship and Temples

Unlike Vishnu and Shiva, who have numerous temples dedicated to them throughout India, Brahma has very few. The most prominent Brahma temple is in Pushkar, Rajasthan, which is considered unique and special precisely because Brahma temples are so rare.

## Brahma in Hindu Denominations

Brahma plays a relatively minor role in most Hindu denominations:

- In Vaishnavism, he is secondary to Vishnu
- In Shaivism, he is considered subordinate to Shiva
- In Shaktism, he is viewed as an aspect of feminine divine power

## Brahma vs. Brahman

It's important to distinguish between Brahma (the deity) and Brahman (the supreme cosmic spirit or ultimate reality in Hindu philosophy). Brahma is a specific god with attributes and stories, while Brahman is the formless, universal principle that represents the absolute reality or cosmic consciousness.
