# Vallabha Sampradaya

Vallabha Sampradaya, also known as Pushti Marg ("Path of Grace"), is a Vaishnava tradition within Hinduism founded by Acharya Vallabha (Vallabhacharya) in the late 15th to early 16th century. This devotional tradition is centered on the worship of Krishna, particularly in his form as Shrinathji, and emphasizes divine grace, loving devotion, and aesthetic celebration in spiritual practice.

## Historical Origins and Development

### Vallabhacharya (1479-1531)

- Born in Champaran forest in central India to Telugu Brahmin parents
- According to tradition, his birth was miraculous as his mother had received a divine vision
- Displayed extraordinary intellectual abilities from childhood
- Educated in Varanasi, mastering the Vedas, Upanishads, and various philosophical systems
- Completed a victorious philosophical tour (digvijaya) of India, debating other scholars
- Received divine revelation of Krishna at Govardhan Hill near Mathura
- Formulated the Shuddhadvaita (Pure Non-dualism) philosophical system
- Authored numerous works, including commentaries on Brahma Sutras and Bhagavata Purana
- Established the worship of Shrinathji after discovering the self-manifested deity at Govardhan

### Organizational Development
