### Early Origins

Goddess worship has ancient roots in India, with evidence from Indus Valley Civilization female figurines. The Rigveda mentions goddesses like Aditi, Ushas, and Prithvi, though they were not yet central deities.

### Classical Period (3rd-8th centuries CE)

Growth of independent Goddess worship, development of Shakta literature, and incorporation of local goddess traditions into mainstream Hinduism.

### Medieval Period (9th-16th centuries CE)

Flourishing of tantric traditions, development of systematic Shakta philosophy, and composition of major texts like the Devi Mahatmya.

### Modern Era (17th century CE onward)

Continuation of traditional practices with reform movements challenging aspects like animal sacrifice, and growing global interest in goddess spirituality.

## Shaktism and Other Hindu Traditions

- **With Vaishnavism**: Some integration, particularly in the worship of Lakshmi and Radha
