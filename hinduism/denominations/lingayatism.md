![Lingayat symbol](lingayat_symbol.jpg)

Lingayatism, also known as Virashaivism, is a distinctive Shaiva Hindu tradition that emerged as a revolutionary reform movement in 12th-century Karnataka, South India. Founded by the social reformer and philosopher Basavanna, it challenged orthodox Brahminical Hinduism by rejecting caste distinctions, temple worship, and elaborate rituals while emphasizing direct devotion to Shiva.

## Core Beliefs

### Theological Framework

- **Supreme Deity**: Worships Shiva as the supreme reality, particularly in the form of the ishtalinga (personal linga)
- **Monistic Philosophy**: Shatsthala doctrine explaining the soul's journey toward union with Shiva
- **Rejection of Dualities**: Emphasis on overcoming distinctions between sacred and profane, pure and impure
- **Egalitarianism**: Radical rejection of caste system and gender discrimination
- **Ethical Living**: Strong emphasis on moral behavior and honest work as spiritual practice

### Key Concepts

- **Ishtalinga**: The personal linga worn on the body representing the unity with Shiva
- **Shatsthala** (Six Stages): Progressive spiritual path toward union with Shiva
  - Bhakti (devotion)
  - Mahesha (service)
  - Prasadi (grace)
  - Pranalingi (life force awareness)
  - Sharana (surrender)
  - Aikya (oneness)
- **Kayaka**: Dignity of labor and working for the community
- **Dasoha**: Sharing with others as a spiritual practice
- **Vachanas**: Poetic expressions of spiritual wisdom

## Sacred Texts

Lingayatism draws from various textual sources:

- **Primary Texts**:
  - Vachanas: Prose-poems composed by Basavanna and other Sharanas (devotees)
  - Shoonya Sampadane: Compilation of dialogues among Sharanas
  - Karana Hasuge: Text attributed to Cennabasavanna
  - Mantra Gopya: Collection of esoteric teachings
  
- **Secondary Sources**:
  - Siddhanta Shikhamani: 13th-century systematic exposition by Shivayogi Shivacharya
  - Veerashaiva Agamas
  - Basava Purana: Hagiography of Basavanna
  - Works of later Lingayat philosophers and poets

## Historical Development

### Origins and Founding

Lingayatism emerged in the 12th century as a response to rigid Brahminical orthodoxy:

- **Basavanna** (1105-1167 CE): Prime minister in the court of King Bijjala II of the Kalachuri dynasty in Kalyana (modern Karnataka)
- **Allama Prabhu**: Mystical poet and contemporary of Basavanna
- **Akka Mahadevi**: Female mystic poet who exemplified radical devotion and spiritual courage

Basavanna assembled a community of like-minded individuals called Sharanas who challenged conventional religious and social norms.

### The Revolution

Key revolutionary aspects included:
- Rejection of caste discrimination
- Equality for women
- Critique of empty ritualism
- Establishment of Anubhava Mantapa (Hall of Experience) as a spiritual parliament
- Widespread use of vernacular language (Kannada) instead of Sanskrit

### Later Developments

After initial revolutionary phase:
- Systematization of teachings in the 13th-16th centuries
- Establishment of monasteries (mathas)
- Development of more structured philosophical framework
- Continuing tension between revolutionary ideals and institutionalization
- Growth as a major religious and political force in Karnataka

## Practices and Observances

### Central Practices

- **Ishtalinga Worship**: Daily veneration of the personal linga worn on the body
- **Panchacharas** (Five Codes of Conduct):
  - Lingachara: Daily worship of the ishtalinga
  - Sadachara: Good conduct
  - Sivachara: Recognizing Shiva in all beings
  - Bhrityachara: Service to the community
  - Ganachara: Defense of the community
- **Ashtavarana** (Eight Shields): Spiritual protections including guru, linga, jangama (wandering teacher), padodaka (holy water), prasada (sacred offering), vibhuti (sacred ash), rudraksha (prayer beads), and mantra

### Distinctive Features

- **Rejection of Temple Worship**: Focus on personal devotion rather than temple rituals
- **No Image Worship**: Except for the abstract form of linga
- **No Pilgrimages**: Emphasis on inner journey rather than external pilgrimage
- **No Fasting or Extreme Austerities**: Balanced lifestyle advocated
- **No Pollution Concepts**: Rejection of ritual purity and pollution ideas

## Institutions and Organization

### Monastic System

Lingayatism developed a monastic system called Virakta Mathas:

### Sociopolitical Influence

Lingayats have been a significant force in Karnataka:
- Major political constituency
