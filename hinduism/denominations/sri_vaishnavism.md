# Sri Vaishnavism

![Sri Vaishnava symbol](sri_vaishnava_symbol.jpg)

Sri Vaishnavism is one of the most influential traditions within Vaishnavism, focused on the worship of Vishnu along with his consort Sri (Lakshmi). Founded by Ramanuja in the 11th century CE, it is also known as the Sri Sampradaya and is primarily based in South India, particularly Tamil Nadu.

## Core Beliefs

### Theological Framework

- **Supreme Deity**: Vishnu/Narayana accompanied by Sri (Lakshmi) as inseparable divine consorts
- **Vishishtadvaita**: Follows the philosophy of "qualified non-dualism" established by Ramanuja
- **Three Realities**: Acknowledges three fundamental realities - God (Ishvara), souls (chit), and matter (achit)
- **Divine Grace**: Emphasizes the role of divine grace (prasada) in salvation

### Key Concepts

- **Prapatti** (surrender): Complete surrender to God as the primary means of salvation
- **Ubhaya Vedanta**: Integration of Sanskrit and Tamil scriptural traditions
- **Acharya-abhimana**: Devotion to the spiritual preceptor lineage
- **Saranagati**: Taking refuge in the divine as the ultimate spiritual practice

## Sacred Texts

Sri Vaishnavism reveres both Sanskrit and Tamil scriptures:

- **Sanskrit Texts**:
  - The Vedas and Upanishads
  - Brahma Sutras
  - Bhagavad Gita
  - Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana

- **Tamil Texts**:
  - Divya Prabandham (also called Nalayira Divya Prabandham) - 4,000 verses composed by the Alvars
  - Works of Ramanuja including Sri Bhashya, Vedartha Sangraha, and Gitabhashya

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early Period

Sri Vaishnavism traces its roots to the Alvars, Tamil poet-saints (6th-9th centuries CE) who composed passionate hymns expressing devotion to Vishnu. The philosophical foundations were established by early acharyas (teachers) including Nathamuni and Yamunacharya.

### Ramanuja's Impact

Ramanuja (1017-1137 CE) systematized the philosophy of Sri Vaishnavism through his commentaries on the Brahma Sutras, Bhagavad Gita, and Upanishads. He established the Vishishtadvaita philosophy, which maintains that souls and matter are distinct from God but form his body and are completely dependent on him.

### Post-Ramanuja Period

After Ramanuja, Sri Vaishnavism split into two sub-sects:

- **Vadakalai** (Northern School): More emphasis on Sanskrit texts, formal ritual, and the monkey analogy (markata-nyaya) where salvation requires effort from the devotee like a baby monkey clinging to its mother
- **Tenkalai** (Southern School): More emphasis on Tamil texts, emotional devotion, and the cat analogy (marjala-nyaya) where salvation comes solely through God's grace, like a kitten carried by its mother

## Worship Practices

### Temple Worship

- **Pancharatra Agama**: Follows the Pancharatra ritual system
- **Archavatara**: Focus on worship of consecrated temple deities
- **Divya Desams**: Special reverence for the 108 sacred sites praised by the Alvars
- **Sri Rangam**: The most important temple, located near Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu

### Personal Devotion

- **Daily Rituals**: Regular recitation of Sanskrit and Tamil hymns
- **Distinctive Marks**: Wearing of namam (U-shaped mark with a central red line)
- **Discipleship**: Relationship with an acharya (spiritual teacher)
- **Dietary Practices**: Strict vegetarianism and food offered to deity first

## Major Figures

- **Nathamuni** (9th-10th century CE): Collected and compiled the Divya Prabandham
- **Yamunacharya** (916-1036 CE): Ramanuja's predecessor who set the philosophical groundwork
- **Ramanuja** (1017-1137 CE): The central theologian and systematizer
- **Vedanta Desika** (1268-1369 CE): Major philosopher of the Vadakalai sub-sect
- **Pillai Lokacharya** (1264-1327 CE): Major teacher of the Tenkalai sub-sect

## Contemporary Presence

Sri Vaishnavism remains a vibrant tradition in South India with many active temples and mathas (monasteries). While traditionally centered in Tamil Nadu, it has also spread globally through diaspora communities in the United States, United Kingdom, and Southeast Asia.

Modern challenges include:
- Preserving traditional practices in a globalized world
- Maintaining both Sanskrit and Tamil linguistic traditions
- Interpreting ancient philosophical ideas for contemporary audiences
