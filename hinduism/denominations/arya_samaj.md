Arya Samaj ("Society of Nobles") is a Hindu reform movement founded by Swami Dayananda Saraswati in 1875. It advocates a return to the Vedas as the source of Hindu religion and rejects later developments it considers corruptions of Hinduism. The movement has played a significant role in the religious, social, and political life of modern India.

## Historical Context and Founding

### Colonial India and Hindu Revivalism

Arya Samaj emerged during a period when:
- British colonial rule had strengthened its hold over India
- Christian missionary activity was intensifying
- Traditional Hindu practices were criticized by both Western and Indian reformers
- Hindu society was seeking ways to respond to these challenges

### Dayananda Saraswati (1824-1883)

- Born as Mool Shankar in Gujarat to a Brahmin family
- Left home at age 21 to pursue spiritual knowledge
- Studied Sanskrit and Vedic texts under various gurus
- Adopted the name Dayananda Saraswati after becoming a sannyasi (renunciant)
- Traveled throughout India challenging religious orthodoxy
- Authored *Satyarth Prakash* (Light of Truth), the foundational text of Arya Samaj

### Establishment and Growth

- First Arya Samaj established in Bombay (now Mumbai) on April 10, 1875
- Second and more influential branch established in Lahore in 1877
- Spread rapidly in Punjab and other parts of north India
- By 1947, there were hundreds of Arya Samaj centers across India

## Core Principles and Beliefs

### Ten Principles (Niyams)

Dayananda established ten principles that all Arya Samajists should follow:

1. God is the primary source of all true knowledge and all that is known through knowledge
2. God is all-truth, all-knowledge, all-beatitude, incorporeal, almighty, just, merciful, unborn, infinite, unchangeable, beginning-less, incomparable, support of all, lord of all, all-pervading, omniscient, imperishable, immortal, fearless, eternal, holy, and creator of the universe
3. The Vedas are the books of true knowledge
4. One should always be ready to accept truth and reject falsehood
5. All actions should be performed in accordance with dharma, after deliberating what is right and wrong
6. The primary aim of the Arya Samaj is to benefit the whole world, through improving the physical, spiritual, and social condition of humanity
7. All should be treated with love, justice, and respect for their merits
8. Ignorance should be dispelled and knowledge increased
9. No one should be content with their own welfare alone, but should consider the welfare of all as their own
10. All human beings should abide by social laws for the common good, while maintaining personal freedom
