# Shaiva Siddhanta

![Shaiva Siddhanta symbol](shaiva_siddhanta_symbol.jpg)

Shaiva Siddhanta is one of the most influential schools of Shaivism, particularly dominant in South India, especially Tamil Nadu. It presents a pluralistic theistic philosophy focusing on the worship of Shiva as the Supreme Deity and emphasizes the relationships between God, souls, and the world.

## Core Beliefs

### Theological Framework

- **Supreme Deity**: Shiva as Pati (Lord), the efficient cause of creation, sustenance, and dissolution
- **Dualistic Philosophy**: Maintains a clear distinction between God (Pati), souls (pashu), and bonds (pasha)
- **Divine Grace**: Emphasizes Shiva's grace (anugraha) as essential for liberation
- **Five Acts of Shiva**: Creation (srishti), preservation (sthiti), dissolution (samhara), obscuration (tirodhana), and bestowal of grace (anugraha)

### Key Concepts

- **Tripada System**: The three categories of reality - Pati (God), pashu (souls), and pasha (bonds)
- **Three Impurities** (malas):
  - Anava mala: The primordial impurity of individuality that limits the soul
  - Karma mala: The effects of actions binding the soul
  - Mayiya mala: Impurity arising from material existence
- **Shiva-jnana**: Knowledge of Shiva as the ultimate means to liberation
- **Charya, Kriya, Yoga, and Jnana**: The four progressive paths to spiritual advancement

## Sacred Texts

Shaiva Siddhanta draws from both Sanskrit and Tamil scriptural traditions:

- **Sanskrit Texts**:
  - The 28 Shaiva Agamas, particularly the 10 principal agamas
  - Shiva Purana
  - Works of Meykandar, especially Shivajnanabodham (Tamil translation of Sanskrit original)

- **Tamil Texts**:
  - Tirumurai: Collection of Tamil Shaiva bhakti hymns (12 books)
  - Tevaram: Hymns by the three principal Nayanars (Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar)
  - Tiruvasagam: Devotional poems by Manikkavacakar
  - Shaiva Siddhanta Shastras: 14 philosophical texts by various authors

## Historical Development

### Early Origins

While the philosophical concepts of Shaiva Siddhanta have ancient roots in the Vedas and Agamas, the tradition as a distinct school emerged around the 5th-6th centuries CE. The Sanskrit Agamas form the earliest scriptural foundation.

### Tamil Development

The tradition took a distinctive form in Tamil South India through the works of the 63 Nayanars (Shaiva saints) from the 6th-10th centuries CE. Their devotional poems, compiled in the Tirumurai, form the emotional and theological core of Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta.

### Philosophical Systematization

The philosophical systematization of Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta occurred around the 12th-14th centuries CE through the works of:
- Meykandar (13th century): Author of Shivajnanabodham, which laid the foundation for systematic Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy
- Arulnandi Shivacharya: Author of Shivajnana Siddhiyar, an extensive commentary on Meykandar's work
- Umapati Shivacharya (14th century): Consolidated the tradition with several key texts

## Worship Practices

### Temple Worship

- **Agamic Rituals**: Temple worship follows elaborate procedures prescribed in the Agamas
- **Puja Sequences**: Follows specific ritual sequences for honoring Shiva
- **Abhisheka**: Ritual bathing of the Shiva lingam with milk, yogurt, honey, ghee, and other substances
- **Prominent Temples**: Chidambaram, Thanjavur, Madurai, and Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu

### Personal Devotion

- **Daily Rituals**: Regular worship of Shiva lingam at home
- **Vibhuti**: Sacred ash applied in three horizontal lines on the forehead
- **Rudraksha**: Wearing of rudraksha beads, sacred to Shiva
- **Meditation**: Focused on Shiva and Shiva-jnana (knowledge of Shiva)
- **Chanting**: Recitation of Panchakshara mantra ("Om Namah Shivaya")

## Major Figures

- **Nayanars**: The 63 Tamil Shaiva saints who composed devotional hymns
  - **Appar** (7th century): Former Jain who converted to Shaivism and composed over 4,900 hymns
  - **Thirujnana Sambandar** (7th century): Child prodigy who composed hymns from age three
  - **Sundarar** (8th century): Composed passionate hymns focusing on Shiva as friend
  - **Manikkavacakar** (9th century): Author of Tiruvasagam, emotional hymns to Shiva

- **Philosophical Masters**:
  - **Meykandar** (13th century): Systematized Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy
  - **Arulnandi Shivacharya**: Meykandar's disciple who expanded his work
  - **Umapati Shivacharya** (14th century): Wrote eight of the fourteen Meykanda Shastras

## Contemporary Presence

Shaiva Siddhanta remains vibrant in Tamil Nadu with many active temples and mathas (monasteries). Notable centers include:

- **Dharmapuram Adheenam**: Important monastery for preserving and teaching Shaiva Siddhanta
- **Tiruvavaduthurai Adheenam**: Major center of Shaiva Siddhanta learning
- **Madurai Adheenam**: Historic monastic institution

The tradition faces modern challenges:
- Adapting ancient practices to contemporary life
- Transmitting philosophical knowledge to younger generations
- Balancing Sanskrit and Tamil traditions

## Global Influence

While traditionally centered in South India, particularly Tamil Nadu, Shaiva Siddhanta has spread globally through:
- Tamil diaspora communities, especially in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, and Western countries
- Academic interest in its philosophical system
- The universal appeal of its devotional traditions
