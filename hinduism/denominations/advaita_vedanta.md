# Advaita Vedanta

![Adi Shankaracharya teaching disciples](advaita_shankara.jpg)

Advaita Vedanta is one of the most influential schools of Hindu philosophy, propounding a non-dualistic (advaita) interpretation of the Upanishads. The term "Advaita" means "non-dual" or "not two," referring to the idea that the true self (Atman) is identical with the ultimate reality (Brahman). Systematized by the 8th-century philosopher Adi Shankaracharya, Advaita Vedanta continues to be a dominant philosophical framework within Hinduism and has significantly influenced modern Hindu thought.

## Core Philosophy

### Fundamental Principles

- **Non-dualism (Advaita)**: Reality is ultimately non-dual; Brahman is the only reality
- **Identity of Atman and Brahman**: The individual self is identical with the ultimate reality
- **Maya**: The phenomenal world is an appearance or illusion superimposed on Brahman
- **Three Levels of Reality**: 
  - Paramarthika (absolute reality): Brahman alone exists
  - Vyavaharika (empirical reality): The world as we experience it
  - Pratibhasika (illusory reality): Misperceptions like seeing a rope as a snake

### Key Concepts

- **Nirguna Brahman**: Brahman without attributes, beyond all descriptions
- **Avidya (Ignorance)**: The root cause of suffering and the perception of multiplicity
- **Jnana (Knowledge)**: The primary means to liberation, specifically knowledge of one's true nature
- **Moksha (Liberation)**: Freedom from the cycle of rebirth through realization of one's identity with Brahman

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early Sources

- **Upanishadic Roots**: Core ideas found in the principal Upanishads
- **Brahma Sutras**: Systematic presentation of Vedantic thought
- **Gaudapada's Karika**: Pre-Shankara exposition of Advaita ideas
- **Buddhist Influence**: Parallels with Madhyamaka and Yogacara Buddhist philosophies

### Adi Shankaracharya and Systematization

Adi Shankaracharya (788-820 CE) systematized Advaita Vedanta through:
- Commentaries (Bhashyas) on the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras, and Bhagavad Gita
- Original works like Vivekachudamani and Upadeshasahasri
- Establishment of four monastic centers (mathas) across India
- Development of a lineage of disciples to preserve and propagate the teachings

### Post-Shankara Developments

- **Vachaspati Mishra (9th century)**: Bhamati school of Advaita
- **Prakashatman (10th century)**: Vivarana school of Advaita
- **Suresvara and Padmapada**: Direct disciples who developed aspects of Shankara's thought
- **Vidyaranya (14th century)**: Synthesized various strands of post-Shankara Advaita

### Modern Revival

- **Neo-Vedanta**: Modern interpretations by figures like Swami Vivekananda
- **Academic Study**: Integration with Western philosophical discourse
- **Global Spread**: Adoption by spiritual seekers worldwide
- **Dialogue with Science**: Contemporary discussions about consciousness

## Epistemology and Methods of Knowledge

Advaita Vedanta recognizes six pramanas (valid means of knowledge):

1. **Pratyaksha** (Perception): Direct sensory experience
2. **Anumana** (Inference): Logical deduction
3. **Upamana** (Comparison): Understanding something by comparing it to something known
4. **Arthapatti** (Postulation): Assumption of a fact to explain an observation
5. **Anupalabdhi** (Non-apprehension): Knowledge from the absence of something
6. **Shabda** (Testimony): Knowledge from reliable sources, especially the Vedas

### Special Importance of Shabda

While acknowledging all six pramanas, Advaita gives special importance to shabda, particularly the Upanishadic statements called "mahavakyas" (great sayings):
- **"Tat Tvam Asi"** (That Thou Art) - Chandogya Upanishad
- **"Aham Brahmasmi"** (I am Brahman) - Brihadaranyaka Upanishad
- **"Prajnanam Brahma"** (Consciousness is Brahman) - Aitareya Upanishad
- **"Ayam Atma Brahma"** (This Self is Brahman) - Mandukya Upanishad

## Philosophical Arguments

### Against Dualism

- **Refutation of Samkhya**: Critique of the dualism of Purusha and Prakriti
- **Critique of Nyaya-Vaisheshika**: Arguments against atomistic pluralism
- **Response to Buddhism**: Distinction from Buddhist emptiness while incorporating aspects of Buddhist logic

### Theory of Error (Khyativada)

- **Anirvacaniya Khyati**: The appearance of the world is neither real nor unreal but inexplicable
- **Rope-Snake Analogy**: Mistaking a rope for a snake illustrates how Brahman appears as the world
- **Superimposition (Adhyasa)**: The attribution of unreal qualities to the real

## Spiritual Path and Practice

### Prerequisites for Practice

- **Sadhana Chatushtaya**: Four-fold discipline:
  1. Viveka (discrimination between real and unreal)
  2. Vairagya (dispassion toward worldly objects)
  3. Shatsampatti (six virtues: tranquility, self-control, withdrawal, endurance, faith, concentration)
  4. Mumukshutva (burning desire for liberation)

### Methods of Practice

- **Shravanam**: Listening to the teachings from a qualified teacher
- **Mananam**: Reflecting on the teachings to remove doubts
- **Nididhyasanam**: Profound and continuous meditation on the truth
- **Samadhi**: Absorption in the non-dual awareness

### Role of the Guru

- **Essential Guide**: The necessity of a self-realized teacher
- **Transmission of Knowledge**: Direct pointing to the truth beyond words
- **Living Example**: Embodiment of the teachings

## Contrasts with Other Vedantic Schools

### Vishishtadvaita (Qualified Non-dualism)

- **Ramanuja's Critique**: Ramanuja's (11th century) objections to Advaita
- **Key Differences**: Vishishtadvaita maintains distinctions between God, souls, and matter

### Dvaita (Dualism)

- **Madhva's Opposition**: Madhva's (13th century) strong rejection of Advaita
- **Fundamental Contrast**: Dvaita asserts five eternal differences, including between God and individual souls

### Bhedabheda (Difference and Non-difference)

- **Middle Position**: Various schools attempting to reconcile unity and diversity
- **Notable Proponents**: Nimbarka, Vallabha, and others who developed distinctive approaches
