The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), popularly known as the "Hare Krishna Movement," is a global Gaudiya Vaishnava organization founded in 1966 by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (1896-1977). ISKCON represents one of the most successful transmissions of Hindu spiritual tradition to the West and has established hundreds of temples, rural communities, schools, and cultural centers worldwide.

## Foundation and History

### Founding and Early Years

ISKCON was established in New York City in July 1966 by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (born Abhay Charan De), who arrived in the United States from India at the age of 69 with very little money but a profound mission: to spread Krishna consciousness throughout the Western world. Key milestones include:

- **1965**: Prabhupada arrives in New York City
- **1966**: Formal establishment of ISKCON in a small storefront on 26th Street, Manhattan
- **1967**: First ISKCON center outside the U.S. established in San Francisco
- **1968-1971**: Rapid expansion across North America, Europe, Australia, and return to India
- **1970s**: Establishment of major centers in Vrindavan and Mayapur, India

### After Prabhupada

Following Prabhupada's passing in 1977, ISKCON continued to grow but also faced significant challenges:

- **1978-1987**: Period of governance by appointed gurus
- **1987**: Formation of the Governing Body Commission (GBC) as the ultimate managerial authority
- **1990s**: Institutional reforms and establishment of checks and balances
- **2000s-Present**: Continued global expansion, particularly in India and Eastern Europe

## Core Beliefs and Teachings

ISKCON adheres to Gaudiya Vaishnava theology as taught by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and interpreted by Prabhupada:

- **Krishna as Supreme**: Recognition of Krishna as the original form of God (Svayam Bhagavan)
- **Achintya Bheda Abheda**: Philosophy of "inconceivable oneness and difference" between God and living entities
- **Chaitanya as Avatar**: Belief that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is a combined incarnation of Radha and Krishna
- **Bhakti Yoga**: Devotional service as the primary spiritual practice
- **Four Regulative Principles**: No meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling, and no illicit sex

## Spiritual Practices
