Brahmo Samaj ("Society of Brahma") is a Hindu reform movement founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy in Calcutta in 1828. It was one of the most influential religious movements in the Indian renaissance of the 19th century and played a significant role in the social and religious reformation of Hindu society, promoting monotheism, rationalism, and social reforms while opposing idolatry, casteism, and social discriminations.

## Historical Context and Founding

### Bengal Renaissance and Colonial Influence

Brahmo Samaj emerged during a period when:
- British colonial rule had introduced Western education and ideas to India
- Traditional Hindu practices were facing criticism from both Europeans and Indian intellectuals
- A new Indian middle class was developing, educated in English and exposed to European Enlightenment thought
- Intellectual climate fostered questioning of religious orthodoxy and social customs

### Raja Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833)

- Born to a Brahmin family in Bengal
- Well-versed in Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, and English
- Studied Hindu scriptures, Islam, and Christianity
- Worked with the British East India Company
- Admired certain aspects of Western thought while remaining proud of Indian civilization
- Campaigned against practices like sati (widow immolation), child marriage, and polygamy
- Founded Brahmo Sabha in 1828, which later became Brahmo Samaj

### Key Development Phases

1. **First Phase (1828-1843)**: Initial establishment under Raja Ram Mohan Roy
2. **Second Phase (1843-1866)**: Leadership of Debendranath Tagore (father of Rabindranath Tagore)
3. **Third Phase (1866-1878)**: Leadership of Keshub Chunder Sen and subsequent schisms
4. **Fourth Phase (1878 onwards)**: Division into multiple branches with differing approaches

## Core Principles and Beliefs

### The Brahmo Covenant (under Debendranath Tagore)

1. Brahmo faith is based on the worship of one eternal, infinite God
2. No created object should be worshipped as God
3. No image, statue, or picture should be used in worship
