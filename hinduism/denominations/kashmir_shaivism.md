# Kashmir Shaivism

![Shiva and Shakti representation](kashmir_shaivism_symbol.jpg)

Kashmir Shaivism is a non-dualistic (advaita) tradition of Shaiva philosophy and practice that originated in Kashmir around the 9th century CE. Distinguished by its sophisticated philosophical framework and tantric elements, it represents one of the most intellectually refined schools of Hindu thought. Also known as Trika Shaivism, it views reality as the singular consciousness of Shiva, with the world as a real manifestation of this divine consciousness.

## Core Philosophy

### Theological Framework

- **Non-Dualism**: The universe is a manifestation of the supreme consciousness (Shiva)
- **Prakasha and Vimarsha**: Light of consciousness (Prakasha) and its self-awareness (Vimarsha)
- **Recognition (Pratyabhijna)**: Liberation through recognizing one's true nature as Shiva
- **Spanda**: The divine vibration or pulsation of consciousness that manifests the universe

### Key Concepts

- **Thirty-six Tattvas**: Expansion of the traditional 25 Samkhya tattvas to 36 principles of existence
- **Three-fold Division (Trika)**: Nara (limited individual), Shakti (divine energy), and Shiva (supreme consciousness)
- **Integral Monism**: Unlike Advaita Vedanta's view of the world as illusion, the world is seen as a real manifestation of Shiva
- **Universal Consciousness**: Everything is a play of consciousness experiencing itself

## Historical Development

### Origins and Classical Period

- **Pre-9th Century**: Roots in earlier Shaiva, Tantric, and Agamic traditions
- **9th Century**: Emergence with Vasugupta's discovery of the Shiva Sutras, allegedly revealed by Shiva himself
- **10th-11th Centuries**: Systematic development by masters like Somananda, Utpaladeva, and Abhinavagupta
- **12th-14th Centuries**: Continuation through disciples like Kshemaraja and Jayaratha

### Decline and Modern Revival

- **20th Century**: Revival through scholars like Swami Lakshman Joo
- **Contemporary Era**: Growing interest in the West and renaissance among modern spiritual seekers

## Key Texts

Kashmir Shaivism is based on a rich textual tradition:

- **Agamas**: Ancient scriptural texts, particularly the monistic Shaiva Agamas
