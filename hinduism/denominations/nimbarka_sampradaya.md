# Nimbarka Sampradaya

Nimbarka Sampradaya is one of the major Vaishnava traditions within Hinduism, founded by the philosopher-saint Nimbarka (also known as Nimbaditya) around the 12th-13th century CE. The tradition is distinguished by its philosophy of Dvaitadvaita (dualistic non-dualism), its emphasis on the divine couple Radha-Krishna as the supreme manifestation of the divine, and its integration of devotional practices with philosophical rigor.

## Historical Origins and Development

### Nimbarka (c. 12th-13th century CE)

- Born in South India, traditionally in Nimba village (in present-day Andhra Pradesh or Karnataka)
- According to tradition, his name derives from an incident where he made the sun (arka) remain in a neem (nimba) tree to allow him to prepare an evening meal for a visiting sannyasi
- Received spiritual education likely in the Vaishnava tradition
- Established his base near Mathura in the Braj region, sacred to Krishna
- Composed key texts including *Vedanta Parijata Saurabha* (commentary on Brahma Sutras) and *Dashashloki* (ten verses summarizing his philosophy)
- Initiated the systematic worship of Radha-Krishna as divine couple
- Established monastic and temple traditions that continue today

### Historical Development

## Philosophy of Dvaitadvaita

### Core Metaphysical Principles

- **Dvaitadvaita** (dualistic non-dualism): Reality has both difference and non-difference simultaneously
- **Brahman as Krishna**: The ultimate reality identified specifically as Lord Krishna
- **Three Eternal Realities**:
  1. **Cit** (conscious souls)
  2. **Acit** (unconscious matter)
  3. **Ishvara** (Supreme Lord)
- **Bhedabheda**: Difference and non-difference coexist without contradiction
- **Anuccheda Principle**: Soul's distinction from Brahman is eternal yet it shares divine qualities
- **Sadrishya**: Similarity rather than identity between soul and Brahman

### Five Differences (Pa√±chabheda)

Nimbarka articulated five key distinctions in reality:
1. **Brahman and Jiva**: Between God and the individual soul
2. **Brahman and Matter**: Between God and the material world
3. **Jiva and Matter**: Between the soul and the material world
4. **Jiva and Jiva**: Between different individual souls
5. **Matter and Matter**: Between different aspects of material nature

### Relationship to Other Vedantic Schools
