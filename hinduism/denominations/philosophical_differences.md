# Philosophical Differences Across Hindu Denominations

![Hindu philosophical discussions](philosophical_differences.jpg)

Hindu denominations are distinguished from one another primarily by their philosophical frameworks—their understanding of the nature of reality, the relationship between God and the individual soul, and the path to liberation. This page explores the key philosophical differences that define Hindu sectarian identities.

## Core Philosophical Questions

Hindu denominations differ in their responses to several fundamental questions:

1. **Nature of Ultimate Reality**: What is the true nature of Brahman/God?
2. **God-Soul Relationship**: What is the relationship between the divine and the individual soul?
3. **Creation**: How did the universe come into being, and what is its relationship to God?
4. **Liberation**: How is moksha (liberation) achieved?
5. **Authority**: Which texts and teachers are authoritative?
