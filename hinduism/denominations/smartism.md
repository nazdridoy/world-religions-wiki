# Smartism

![Panchayatana deities](smartism_worship.jpg)

Smartism is one of the four major denominations of Hinduism, characterized by its liberal and inclusive approach to worship. Unlike the more deity-specific traditions of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism, Smartism advocates the worship of multiple deities as equal manifestations of the same Brahman. The term "Smarta" derives from "Smriti" (remembered texts), indicating adherence to a wide range of Hindu scriptures beyond the Vedas.

## Core Beliefs

### Theological Framework

- **Ultimate Reality**: Brahman as the formless, ultimate reality, with deities as manifestations
- **Equality of Deities**: Recognition of multiple paths and deities as equally valid
- **Advaita Vedanta**: Strong foundation in non-dualistic philosophy
- **Unity in Diversity**: Emphasis on the underlying unity of all genuine religious paths

### Key Concepts

- **Panchayatana Puja**: Worship of five principal deities (Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, Ganesha, and Devi)
- **Shanmata**: Six-fold system of worship (the five deities plus Skanda/Kartikeya)
- **Advaita**: Non-dualism, the philosophical foundation that all reality is fundamentally one
- **Traditional Orthodoxy**: Strong emphasis on following Vedic rituals and practices

## Sacred Texts

Smartas revere a wide range of Hindu scriptures:

- **Vedas**: The primary authoritative texts
- **Upanishads**: Philosophical texts, particularly those supporting Advaita philosophy
- **Brahma Sutras**: Systematic summary of Vedanta philosophy
- **Bhagavad Gita**: Universal scripture honored across Hindu traditions
- **Puranas**: Mythological texts related to various deities
- **Dharma Shastras**: Texts on ethics, law, and social conduct, particularly Manusmriti
- **Works of Adi Shankaracharya**: Commentaries and original compositions

## Philosophical Foundation

The philosophical foundation of Smartism is primarily Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism) as systematized by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century CE. Key tenets include:

- **Brahman and Atman are One**: The individual self (atman) is identical with the universal self (Brahman)
- **Maya**: The phenomenal world is an illusion created by ignorance
- **Jnana**: Knowledge as the primary means to liberation
- **Nirguna Brahman**: Ultimate reality as being without attributes, beyond all descriptions

## Worship Practices

### Panchayatana Puja

The hallmark of Smarta worship is the Panchayatana Puja, involving the worship of five deities together:

1. **Shiva**: Represented by the lingam
2. **Vishnu**: Often represented by a shaligrama stone or image
3. **Devi (Goddess)**: Often as Parvati or Durga
4. **Surya**: The Sun god
5. **Ganesha**: The elephant-headed remover of obstacles

In this system, one deity is often given prominence as the ishta-devata (chosen deity) while the others are worshipped as subordinate manifestations.

### Temple and Home Worship

- **Daily Rituals**: Sandhyavandanam (twilight prayers), nitya puja (daily worship)
- **Traditional Rites**: Strong adherence to traditional Vedic rituals
- **Sacred Symbols**: Use of sacred thread (yajnopavita), vibhuti (sacred ash), and other traditional markers
- **Festivals**: Celebration of a wide range of Hindu festivals related to various deities

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early Development

The roots of Smartism can be traced to Mimamsa and early Vedantic traditions, but it was systematized by Adi Shankaracharya (788-820 CE), who sought to unite various Hindu traditions against the growing influence of Buddhism and Jainism.

### Shankaracharya's Reforms

- **Establishment of Four Mathas**: Shankaracharya established four monastic centers (Sringeri, Puri, Dwarka, and Joshimath) to propagate Advaita Vedanta
- **Development of Dashanami Order**: Organization of ascetics into ten named groups
- **Revival of Vedic Tradition**: Emphasis on returning to the authority of the Vedas

### Medieval and Modern Periods

Throughout medieval times, Smartism remained influential among Brahmin communities, particularly in South India. In the modern era, it has evolved to incorporate elements of reform movements while maintaining its traditional core.

## Key Figures and Saints

- **Adi Shankaracharya**: The 8th-century philosopher who systematized Advaita Vedanta and revitalized Smartism
- **Vidyaranya**: 14th-century Advaita philosopher and head of the Sringeri Matha
- **Appayya Dikshitar**: 16th-century philosopher who sought to reconcile various philosophical schools
- **Chandrashekhara Bharati**: 20th-century head of the Sringeri Matha and influential Advaita scholar
- **Swami Chandrasekhara Saraswati**: 20th-century head of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham

## Institutions and Centers

Smartism is institutionally represented by the four main mathas (monasteries) established by Shankaracharya:

1. **Sringeri Sharada Peetham** (South, Karnataka)
2. **Dwarka Sharada Peetham** (West, Gujarat)
3. **Govardhana Peetham** (East, Odisha)
4. **Jyotir Math** (North, Uttarakhand)

Additionally, the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham in Tamil Nadu is considered by many as the fifth matha established by Shankaracharya or his disciples.

## Smartism and Other Hindu Traditions

- **With Vaishnavism**: Acknowledges Vishnu as a valid form of Brahman while maintaining the equality of deities
- **With Shaivism**: Respects Shiva as a primary manifestation of Brahman while promoting broader worship
- **With Shaktism**: Incorporates Goddess worship within its pantheon
- **Sectarian Relations**: Often functions as a bridge between different denominational traditions

## Contemporary Smartism

In modern times, Smartism faces various challenges and opportunities:

- **Preservation of Tradition**: Maintaining rigorous Vedic practices in a changing world
- **Reform Movements**: Addressing social issues like caste discrimination
- **Global Reach**: Expansion through diaspora communities and interest in Vedanta philosophy
- **Scholarly Contributions**: Ongoing scholarship in Advaita Vedanta and Sanskrit studies

## Demographic and Geographic Presence

- **Geographic Strongholds**: Particularly prevalent in South India, especially Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh
- **Social Context**: Traditionally associated with Brahmin communities
- **Modern Context**: Increasingly adopted by educated urban Hindus attracted to its philosophical sophistication and inclusivity
