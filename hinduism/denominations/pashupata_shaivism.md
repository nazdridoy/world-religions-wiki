# Pashupata Shaivism

![Pashupati Seal](pashupata_seal.jpg)

Pashupata Shaivism is one of the oldest and most influential ascetic traditions within Shaivism. Named after Pashupati ("Lord of Animals," an epithet of Shiva), this tradition is characterized by its distinctive ascetic practices, unconventional behavior, and unique theological framework aimed at achieving liberation from worldly bonds.

## Core Beliefs

### Theological Framework

- **Supreme Deity**: Worships Rudra-Shiva as Pashupati, the lord of all bound souls (pashus)
- **Dualistic Theology**: Maintains a fundamental distinction between God (pati), souls (pashu), and bondage (pasha)
- **Five Categories** (pañchārtha):
  - Cause (kāraṇa): Shiva as the efficient cause
  - Effect (kārya): The bound soul or creation
  - Union (yoga): Spiritual disciplines
  - Observance (vidhi): Ritual and behavioral prescriptions
  - End of Sorrow (duḥkhānta): Ultimate liberation
- **Divine Grace**: Emphasizes Shiva's grace (prasāda) as essential for liberation

### Key Concepts

- **Pashu-Pati-Pasha**: The triad of bound soul, lord, and bondage
- **Mystical Union**: The goal of becoming like Shiva (not identical)
- **Āṇava Mala**: The primordial impurity of individuality
- **Kārma Mala**: The bonds created by actions
- **Spiritual Liberation**: Freedom from bondage through Shiva's grace and ascetic practice

## Sacred Texts

Pashupata Shaivism draws from various textual sources:

- **Primary Texts**:
  - Pāśupata Sūtra: Attributed to Lakulīsha, the foundational text of the tradition
  - Pañchārtha-bhāṣya: Kauṇḍinya's detailed commentary on the Pāśupata Sūtra
  - Gaṇakārikā: Another key text attributed to the Pashupata tradition
  
- **Secondary Sources**:
  - References in the Mahābhārata, particularly the Śānti Parva
  - Mentions in the Purāṇas, especially the Vāyu, Liṅga, and Kūrma Purāṇas
  - Descriptions in texts like Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha (14th century)

## Historical Development

### Origins

Pashupata Shaivism is traditionally traced to Lord Shiva himself, who is said to have incarnated as Lakulīsha (the "lord with a club") in the 2nd century CE in Gujarat. Archaeological and textual evidence suggests the tradition may have earlier roots:

- The Pashupati Seal from the Indus Valley Civilization (2600-1900 BCE) shows a figure in a yogic posture surrounded by animals, which some scholars link to proto-Shaivism
- Rudra (an early form of Shiva) is prominently mentioned in the Vedas
- References to ascetics dedicated to Rudra appear in early texts

### Classical Period

The tradition flourished approximately from the 2nd to the 10th century CE:
- Spread throughout North India, particularly Gujarat, Rajasthan, Kashmir, and Nepal
- Establishment of major centers at Kārohaṇa (Karvan in modern Gujarat) and Mathura
- Development of systematic philosophy and practices
- Royal patronage in various regions

### Later Developments

By the medieval period, Pashupata Shaivism began to merge with other Shaiva traditions:
- Influenced the development of Kashmir Shaivism
- Elements absorbed into Shaiva Siddhanta
- Contributed to the development of later tantric traditions
- Gradual decline as an independent tradition after the 14th century

## Practices and Observances

### Spiritual Stages

The Pashupata path follows five stages of spiritual practice:

1. **Initiate Stage** (Novice): Following conventional Vedic practices
2. **Pashupata Vrata**: Unconventional behavior to break social conditioning
3. **Victory Over Senses**: Withdrawal from external influences
4. **Cutting of Bonds**: Advanced yogic practices
5. **Final State**: Dwelling in cremation grounds and complete renunciation

### Distinctive Practices

- **Bhasma Snāna**: Bathing in sacred ash
- **Aṭṭahāsa**: Loud, seemingly unmotivated laughter
- **Jadavat**: Appearing insane or like an idiot in public
- **Kukkuṭavrata**: Making sounds like animals
- **Maṇḍalakrīḍā**: Sacred dance in circles
- **Huḍukkāra**: Making unusual sounds
- **Pañchāgni Tapas**: Ascetic practice of sitting surrounded by five fires

### Philosophical Method

- **Deliberate Social Transgression**: Breaking social norms to overcome ego
- **Yogic Disciplines**: Advanced internal practices
- **Māyā as Training**: Using unconventional behavior to generate abuse from others, which transfers merit from the abuser to the practitioner
- **Meditation on Shiva**: Constant contemplation of the divine

## Major Centers and Influence

The Pashupata tradition was associated with several important sites:

- **Kārohaṇa** (modern Karvan in Gujarat): Traditional birthplace of Lakulīsha
- **Mathura**: Major center with archaeological evidence of Pashupata presence
- **Kashi (Varanasi)**: Important center for ascetics
- **Pashupati Temple in Nepal**: Major pilgrimage site associated with the tradition
- **Somnath Temple**: Significant temple associated with Pashupatas

## Legacy and Contemporary Presence

While Pashupata Shaivism no longer exists as a distinct organized tradition, its influence continues:

- Philosophical concepts absorbed into broader Shaiva traditions
- Some ascetic practices continue among Shaiva sadhus
- Archaeological remains at various sites
- Textual legacy preserved in various Shaiva and philosophical works
- Revival of interest through academic study

## Major Figures

- **Bhāsarvajña**: (10th century) Important later commentator
- **Four Disciples of Lakulīsha**: Kushika, Gargya, Maitreya, and Kaurusha, who established four branches of the tradition

## Philosophical Contributions

Pashupata Shaivism made several unique contributions to Hindu thought:

- Early systematic dualistic philosophy
- Innovative concept of spiritual practice through deliberate social transgression
- Detailed understanding of the psychology of spiritual transformation
- Integration of Yoga, devotion, and ritualistic elements
