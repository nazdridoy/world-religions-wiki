# Avatars - Divine Incarnations

![Dashavatar - The ten avatars of Vishnu](avatars_vishnu.jpg)

The concept of avatars or divine incarnations is a central feature of Hindu theology, particularly in Vaishnavism. The Sanskrit term "avatar" (avatāra) literally means "descent," referring to the descent of a deity from heaven to earth. While avatars are most commonly associated with Vishnu, other deities like Shiva and Devi are also believed to take incarnations in various Hindu traditions.

## Core Concept

### Definition and Purpose

An avatar is the embodiment of a divine being in a physical, typically human, form. According to Hindu texts, the primary purposes of divine incarnations are:

- To restore dharma (cosmic order and righteousness) when it declines
- To protect the virtuous and punish evildoers
- To guide humanity during critical periods of history
- To demonstrate divine play (lila) in the physical world
- To make the divine accessible to devotees through a tangible form

### Types of Avatars

Hindu tradition recognizes different categories of avatars:

1. **Purna Avatars**: Complete manifestations where the deity descends with full divine powers (e.g., Krishna)
2. **Amsha Avatars**: Partial incarnations containing only aspects of divine power
3. **Avesha Avatars**: Temporary embodiments where divine power enters a being for a specific purpose
4. **Kala Avatars**: Fractional incarnations with limited divine powers

## Avatars of Vishnu

### The Dashavatara (Ten Avatars)

The most famous series of incarnations is the Dashavatara of Vishnu:

1. **Matsya** (Fish) - Saved Manu (the first man) from a great deluge
2. **Kurma** (Tortoise) - Supported Mount Mandara during the churning of the ocean
3. **Varaha** (Boar) - Rescued the Earth from the cosmic waters
4. **Narasimha** (Man-Lion) - Destroyed the demon king Hiranyakashipu
5. **Vamana** (Dwarf) - Subdued the demon king Bali with three steps
6. **Parashurama** (Rama with an Axe) - Destroyed the corrupt warrior class
7. **Rama** - Exemplary king and protagonist of the Ramayana
8. **Krishna** - Divine statesman and teacher of the Bhagavad Gita
9. **Buddha** - Interpreted variously as the historical Buddha or an impostor avatar
10. **Kalki** - Future avatar who will appear at the end of Kali Yuga

### Evolutionary Interpretation

Some modern interpreters have noted that the sequence of Vishnu's avatars roughly parallels evolutionary development—from aquatic life (fish), to amphibian (tortoise), to mammal (boar), to half-animal/half-human (Narasimha), to human forms of increasing sophistication—though this interpretation is not found in traditional texts.

### Extended Lists

Various Puranas mention different numbers of Vishnu's avatars:
- The Bhagavata Purana mentions 22 avatars
- Some traditions recognize 24 avatars
- The Matsya Purana lists 10 primary avatars but acknowledges countless incarnations

## Avatars in Different Hindu Traditions

### In Vaishnavism

- Central theological concept with elaborate mythologies
- Basis for devotional practices focused on Rama and Krishna
- Philosophical significance as bridges between the transcendent and immanent divine

### In Shaivism

Shiva's incarnations include:
- **Virabhadra** - Created from Shiva's anger to destroy Daksha's sacrifice
- **Hanuman** - Considered a partial incarnation in some traditions
- **Sharabha** - Lion-bird form that subdued Narasimha
- **Bhairava** - Fierce form that appeared to punish Brahma
- **Durvasa** - The irascible sage known for his curses

### In Shaktism

The Goddess appears in various forms:
- **Dashamahavidyas** - Ten wisdom goddess forms
- **Saptamatrikas** - Seven mother goddesses
- **Shakti Peethas** - Sites where parts of Sati's body fell, each with a distinct form of the Goddess

## Theological Significance

### Philosophical Interpretations

Different philosophical schools interpret avatars differently:

- **Advaita Vedanta**: Sees avatars as manifestations of the same ultimate reality that constitutes everything
- **Vishishtadvaita**: Views avatars as real manifestations of God who retains his transcendent nature while appearing in the world
- **Dvaita**: Considers avatars as actual appearances of the Supreme Lord to fulfill specific missions

### Immanence and Transcendence

The avatar concept bridges Hindu ideas of:
- God beyond form (nirguna) and God with form (saguna)
- The transcendent divine beyond the world and the immanent divine within it
- The abstract philosophical absolute and the personal deity of devotion

## Cultural Impact

### In Art and Literature

Avatars have inspired:
- Rich traditions of religious iconography

- Christianity's doctrine of incarnation (Jesus Christ as God incarnate)
- Buddhism's concept of nirmanakaya (the physical manifestation of a Buddha)
- Jainism's Tirthankaras (though not considered divine incarnations in the same sense)

### Modern Interpretations

Contemporary Hindu thinkers have interpreted the avatar concept in various ways:
- Symbolic representations of evolutionary spiritual development
- Archetypes representing different aspects of human consciousness
- Historical figures who embodied divine qualities at critical moments

## Controversial Aspects

### Human Claimants

Throughout history, various individuals have claimed to be avatars:
