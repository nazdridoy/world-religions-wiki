![Yogic meditation](yogic_meditation.jpg)

Yoga, meaning "union" or "to yoke," represents one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy (darshanas). Far more than just physical postures, yoga encompasses a comprehensive philosophical system aimed at understanding the nature of consciousness and achieving liberation from suffering through the union of individual self with the divine. This article explores the rich philosophical dimensions of yoga within Hinduism.

## Historical Development

### Vedic Roots
- Early references in the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE)
- Concepts of tapas (austerity) in early Vedic literature
- Meditative practices described in the Upanishads
- Emergence of yoga as a systematic practice for self-realization

### Pre-Classical Yoga
- Yoga concepts in early Upanishads (800-500 BCE)
- Early practices emphasized in the Katha, Shvetashvatara, and MaitrÄ« Upanishads
- Emergence of key concepts like dhyana (meditation) and samadhi (absorption)
- Pre-systematic forms of practice focused on meditation

### Classical Formulation
- **Patanjali's Yoga Sutras** (c. 200 BCE - 200 CE): Systematized yoga philosophy
- Organized as a practical path for controlling the mind and achieving liberation
- Established the Ashtanga (eight-limbed) system
- Synthesis of older yogic practices into a coherent system

### Post-Classical Developments
- **Hatha Yoga** (c. 10th-11th centuries CE): Focus on physical practices
- **Tantra-influenced systems**: Incorporation of subtle body concepts
- **Bhakti Yoga**: Integration of devotional elements

## Core Philosophical Concepts

### Purusha and Prakriti
- **Purusha**: Pure consciousness, the witness, the true self
- **Prakriti**: Nature, the material world, including mind and body
- Yoga aims to distinguish between the two and realize purusha's independence
- Derived from Samkhya philosophy but applied practically in yoga

### The Five Kleshas (Afflictions)
According to Patanjali, five afflictions bind us to suffering:
1. **Avidya** (Ignorance): Misunderstanding the nature of reality
2. **Asmita** (Egoism): Identifying with the limited self
3. **Raga** (Attachment): Craving for pleasure
4. **Dvesha** (Aversion): Avoidance of pain
5. **Abhinivesha** (Fear of Death): Clinging to life

### Chitta and Its Vrittis
- **Chitta**: Mind-stuff, the mental field
- **Vrittis**: Thought patterns or mental fluctuations
- Five types of vrittis: valid cognition, misconception, imagination, sleep, and memory
- Goal of yoga: "Chitta vritti nirodha" - cessation of mental fluctuations

### States of Mind
Patanjali describes five states of mind:
1. **Kshipta**: Disturbed, restless
2. **Mudha**: Dull, heavy
3. **Vikshipta**: Distracted but with moments of focus
4. **Ekagra**: One-pointed concentration
5. **Niruddha**: Completely restrained

### Samadhi: States of Absorption
- **Samprajnata Samadhi**: Conscious absorption with object
- **Asamprajnata Samadhi**: Absorption beyond object
- **Savikalpa Samadhi**: With differentiation
- **Nirvikalpa Samadhi**: Without differentiation
- **Dharma Megha Samadhi**: "Cloud of virtue" - highest absorption leading to kaivalya

### Kaivalya: Liberation
- Final state of absolute freedom
- Isolation of pure consciousness from all mental activities
- Cessation of identification with prakriti
- Established in one's true nature as purusha
- End of the cycle of suffering
