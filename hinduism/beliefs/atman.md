# Atman - The Inner Self

![Symbolic representation of Atman](atman_symbol.jpg)

Atman is one of the most fundamental concepts in Hindu philosophy, referring to the eternal, unchanging inner self or soul. It is contrasted with the physical body and mind, which are temporary and subject to change. According to Hindu thought, the true nature of Atman is pure consciousness, which is identical with Brahman, the ultimate reality.

## Understanding Atman

The word "Atman" derives from the Sanskrit root "an" (to breathe), suggesting its nature as the essence that animates life. It is characterized as:

- **Eternal** (nitya) - beyond birth and death
- **Conscious** (chit) - pure awareness
- **Blissful** (ananda) - inherently peaceful and joyful
- **Unchanging** (avikari) - not affected by physical or mental transformations
- **Self-luminous** (svayam-prakasha) - self-evident and not requiring external validation

## Atman in Hindu Scriptures

### In the Upanishads

The Upanishads contain the most profound discussions on Atman. Key references include:

- **Brihadaranyaka Upanishad**: "This Atman is That which has been described as 'Not this, not this' (neti neti)."
- **Chandogya Upanishad**: "Tat Tvam Asi" (That Thou Art) - affirming the identity of Atman with Brahman.
- **Katha Upanishad**: Compares the relationship between Atman and the body to that of a rider in a chariot.
- **Mandukya Upanishad**: Describes four states of Atman - waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and turiya (transcendent consciousness).

### In the Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita elaborates on the nature of Atman in several verses:

"Weapons do not cleave this self, fire does not burn it; waters do not make it wet; nor does the wind make it dry." (Chapter 2, Verse 23)

"The Atman is never born, nor does it ever die. It did not come into being at any time, nor will it cease to be. Unborn, eternal, permanent, and primeval, the Atman is not destroyed when the body is destroyed." (Chapter 2, Verse 20)

## Philosophical Perspectives on Atman

Different schools of Hindu philosophy interpret Atman in various ways:

### Advaita Vedanta

In Advaita (non-dualism) as propounded by Adi Shankaracharya, Atman is identical with Brahman. The perceived difference is due to avidya (ignorance). Upon realization of this non-duality, one attains liberation (moksha).

### Vishishtadvaita

Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) maintains that while Atman and Brahman are essentially one, they are not completely identical. The individual self is a mode or aspect of Brahman, possessing consciousness but dependent on Brahman.

### Dvaita

Madhvacharya's Dvaita (dualism) philosophy holds that Atman is fundamentally different from Brahman, though both are eternal. According to this view, individual souls remain distinct entities even after liberation.

### Samkhya

The Samkhya school distinguishes between Purusha (pure consciousness, similar to Atman) and Prakriti (matter). Liberation comes from discerning between these two principles.

## The Journey of Atman

### Atman and Samsara

According to Hindu belief, the Atman journeys through the cycle of death and rebirth (samsara) due to ignorance of its true nature and attachment to worldly desires. The Atman assumes various bodies according to its karma.

The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes this process: "As a person acts, so does he become. One becomes virtuous by virtuous action, bad by bad action."

### States of Consciousness

The Atman experiences different states of consciousness:

1. **Jagrat** (waking state) - normal everyday consciousness
2. **Svapna** (dream state) - experience during dreams
3. **Sushupti** (deep sleep) - state of undifferentiated consciousness
4. **Turiya** (transcendent state) - pure consciousness beyond the other three states

### Path to Self-Realization

The ultimate goal in Hindu philosophy is to realize the true nature of Atman through:

- **Jnana** (knowledge) - intellectual understanding of Atman's nature
- **Dhyana** (meditation) - direct experience of Atman through contemplation
- **Yoga** - disciplines that facilitate Atman-realization
- **Bhakti** (devotion) - surrender to the divine to realize the self

## Atman in Daily Life

### Ethical Implications

The concept of Atman has profound ethical implications:

- Since the same Atman resides in all beings, harming others is tantamount to harming oneself
- Recognition of the divine nature of all beings promotes compassion and non-violence
- Understanding the eternal nature of Atman reduces attachment to the temporary

### Practices for Atman-Realization

Various practices aim to help realize the nature of Atman:

- **Self-inquiry** (atma-vichara) - questioning "Who am I?" to discover the true self
- **Witness consciousness** (sakshi bhava) - cultivating awareness as the observer rather than the doer
- **Detachment** (vairagya) - reducing identification with body, mind, and external objects

## Misconceptions About Atman

### Atman vs. Western Concept of Soul

The Hindu concept of Atman differs from the Western concept of soul in several ways:
- Atman is not created at birth but is eternal
- Atman is not separate from the divine but is ultimately one with it
- Atman is not an individual personality but pure consciousness

### Atman vs. Ego

Atman should not be confused with ego (ahamkara):
- Ego is the sense of "I" or individuality that develops through experience
- Atman is the unchanging witness consciousness that observes the ego
- Realizing Atman involves transcending, not enhancing, the ego
