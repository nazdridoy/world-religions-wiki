# The Six Darshanas - Classical Schools of Hindu Philosophy

![Representation of Hindu philosophical schools](darshanas_illustration.jpg)

The term "darshana" derives from the Sanskrit root "drish" (to see) and refers to the six orthodox (astika) schools of Hindu philosophy. These philosophical systems provide different theoretical frameworks for understanding reality, consciousness, and liberation. While each school has its own distinct approach, they all accept the authority of the Vedas and share certain fundamental concepts.

## Overview of the Six Schools

The six classical darshanas can be paired as follows, with each pair having complementary approaches:

1. **Nyaya and Vaisheshika**: Focus on logic, epistemology, and metaphysics
2. **Samkhya and Yoga**: Focus on cosmology, psychology, and practice
3. **Mimamsa and Vedanta**: Focus on scriptural interpretation and ultimate reality

## Nyaya: The School of Logic

### Core Principles

- **Founder**: Gautama (also known as Akshapada)
- **Main Text**: Nyaya Sutras
- **Focus**: Logical analysis, rules of inference, epistemology
- **Goal**: Liberation through perfect knowledge of reality

### Epistemology (Pramanas)

Nyaya recognizes four valid sources of knowledge:

1. **Pratyaksha** (Perception): Direct sensory knowledge
2. **Anumana** (Inference): Deductive and inductive reasoning
3. **Upamana** (Comparison): Knowledge from similarity
4. **Shabda** (Testimony): Knowledge from reliable sources, including the Vedas

### Logical System

- Pioneered a sophisticated system of logic and debate
- Developed a five-part syllogism (pancavayava vakya):
  1. Pratij√±a (proposition)
  2. Hetu (reason)
  3. Udaharana (example)
  4. Upanaya (application)
  5. Nigamana (conclusion)

### Metaphysics

- Accepts sixteen fundamental categories of reality
- Views the world as composed of atoms and distinct selves (atman)
- Acknowledges the existence of God (Ishvara) as the efficient cause of creation

## Vaisheshika: The School of Atomism

### Core Principles

- **Founder**: Kanada (also known as Kashyapa)
- **Main Text**: Vaisheshika Sutras
- **Focus**: Categorization of reality, atomic theory, physics
- **Goal**: Understanding the nature of the physical world to achieve liberation

### Categories of Reality

Vaisheshika proposes seven categories (padarthas):

1. **Dravya** (Substance): Earth, water, fire, air, ether, time, space, soul, and mind
2. **Guna** (Quality): Properties like color, taste, smell
3. **Karma** (Action): Motion and activity
4. **Samanya** (Universal): Generality, commonness
5. **Vishesha** (Particularity): Uniqueness, distinctiveness
6. **Samavaya** (Inherence): Inseparable relation between parts and whole
7. **Abhava** (Non-existence): Absence or negation

### Atomic Theory

- The world is composed of eternal, indivisible atoms (anu)
- Combinations of atoms form all physical objects
- The creation and dissolution of the world involves combination and separation of atoms

## Samkhya: The School of Enumeration

### Core Principles

- **Founder**: Kapila
- **Main Text**: Samkhya Karika by Ishvarakrishna
- **Focus**: Dualistic metaphysics, evolution of cosmos
- **Goal**: Discrimination between Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter)

### Dualistic Metaphysics

- **Purusha**: Pure consciousness, multiple and individual
- **Prakriti**: Primordial matter, consisting of three gunas (qualities):
  - Sattva (purity, harmony)
  - Rajas (activity, passion)
  - Tamas (inertia, darkness)

### Cosmic Evolution

- Creation begins when Purusha comes into proximity with Prakriti
- The interaction causes Prakriti to evolve into 23 principles (tattvas), creating the manifest universe:
  1. Mahat (cosmic intelligence)
  2. Ahamkara (ego principle)
  3. Manas (mind)
  4. Five sense organs (jnanendriyas)
  5. Five action organs (karmendriyas)
  6. Five subtle elements (tanmatras)
  7. Five gross elements (mahabhutas)

### Path to Liberation

- Liberation comes through discriminative knowledge (viveka)
- Realizing "I am not this" - the distinction between self and nature
- Classical Samkhya is notably atheistic, not requiring God for its cosmology

## Yoga: The School of Discipline

### Core Principles

- **Systematizer**: Patanjali
- **Main Text**: Yoga Sutras
- **Focus**: Practical methodology for stilling the mind
- **Goal**: Attainment of samadhi (absorption) and kaivalya (isolation of pure consciousness)

### Eight Limbs (Ashtanga Yoga)

Patanjali's system consists of eight progressive stages:

1. **Yama** (Restraints): Ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truthfulness), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (continence), aparigraha (non-possessiveness)
2. **Niyama** (Observances): Saucha (purity), santosha (contentment), tapas (austerity), svadhyaya (self-study), Ishvara pranidhana (surrender to God)
3. **Asana** (Posture): Steady, comfortable position
4. **Pranayama** (Breath Control): Regulation of breath
5. **Pratyahara** (Sense Withdrawal): Internalization of attention
6. **Dharana** (Concentration): One-pointed focus
7. **Dhyana** (Meditation): Unbroken flow of attention
8. **Samadhi** (Absorption): Complete union with the object of meditation

### Metaphysical Framework

- Largely adopts Samkhya metaphysics
- Adds the concept of Ishvara (God) as a special Purusha
- Views the mind (chitta) as composed of the three gunas

## Mimamsa: The School of Ritual Exegesis

### Core Principles

- **Founder**: Jaimini
- **Main Text**: Mimamsa Sutras
- **Focus**: Interpretation of Vedic rituals, hermeneutics
- **Goal**: Dharma (righteousness) through proper ritual performance

### Scriptural Authority

- Emphasizes the earlier portion of the Vedas (Samhitas and Brahmanas)
- Developed elaborate principles of textual interpretation
- Views the Vedas as eternal, authorless (apaurusheya), and self-validating

### Epistemology

Mimamsa recognizes six pramanas (means of knowledge):

1. **Pratyaksha** (Perception)
2. **Anumana** (Inference)
3. **Shabda** (Verbal testimony)
4. **Upamana** (Comparison)
5. **Arthapatti** (Postulation)
6. **Anupalabdhi** (Non-apprehension)

### Ritualistic Focus

- Detailed analysis of ritual actions and their efficacy
- Theory of unseen potency (apurva) created by ritual actions
- Originally did not emphasize a personal deity, focusing instead on the power of ritual itself

## Vedanta: The School of Culmination

### Core Principles

- **Systematizer**: Badarayana
- **Main Text**: Brahma Sutras (Vedanta Sutras)
- **Focus**: Ultimate reality, nature of Brahman, relationship between self and cosmos
- **Goal**: Moksha through knowledge of Brahman

### Major Sub-Schools

Vedanta developed into several influential sub-schools:

1. **Advaita Vedanta** (Non-dualism) - Adi Shankara:
   - Brahman alone is real; world is illusory (maya)
   - Individual self (atman) is identical with Brahman
   - Liberation comes through knowledge (jnana)

2. **Vishishtadvaita** (Qualified Non-dualism) - Ramanuja:
   - Brahman has attributes and qualities
   - Individual souls and world are real but dependent on Brahman
   - Devotion (bhakti) leads to liberation

3. **Dvaita** (Dualism) - Madhva:
   - Brahman and individual souls are eternally distinct
   - Five fundamental, eternal distinctions exist
   - Devotion to Vishnu is essential for liberation

### Textual Authority

- Based primarily on the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Brahma Sutras (the "three pillars" or prasthanatrayi)
- Developed sophisticated commentarial traditions on these texts
- Each sub-school interprets key passages differently

## Historical Development

### Early Period (500 BCE - 200 CE)

- Formation of the basic sutras for each school
- Oral transmission of doctrines through teacher-student lineages
- Interaction with Buddhist and Jain philosophies

### Classical Period (200 - 1000 CE)

- Development of major commentaries on sutras
- Intense debates between schools
- Systematization of doctrines

### Medieval Period (1000 - 1700 CE)

- Dominance of Vedanta over other schools
- Integration of darshanic elements into devotional traditions
- Development of sub-schools within each tradition

## Philosophical Interconnections

Despite their differences, the darshanas share many concepts and often borrowed from each other:

- **Epistemological Tools**: Nyaya's logical methods were adopted by all schools
- **Metaphysical Framework**: Samkhya's categories influenced multiple traditions
- **Practical Methods**: Yoga techniques were incorporated across schools
- **Interpretive Principles**: Mimamsa's hermeneutics were widely applied
- **Ultimate Goals**: All seek liberation, though they define it differently

## Contemporary Relevance

- **Academic Study**: Continues in traditional institutions (mathas) and modern universities
- **Modern Applications**: Influence on psychology, cognitive science, and logic
- **Spiritual Practices**: Philosophical foundations for contemporary Hindu practice
- **Cross-Cultural Dialogue**: Engagement with Western and global philosophical traditions
