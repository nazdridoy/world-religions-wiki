![Representation of Satya](satya_illustration.jpg)

Satya (सत्य) is a fundamental concept in Hindu philosophy that translates as "truth" or "reality." It represents what truly exists, what is real, and what is unchangeable. As one of the five yamas (ethical restraints) in Yogic philosophy, and as a core value emphasized throughout Hindu texts, satya holds both philosophical and practical significance in Hindu thought and life.

## Philosophical Foundation

### Etymological Roots

- Derived from the Sanskrit root "sat" meaning "being," "existing," or "that which is"
- Represents that which is true, genuine, and enduring
- Contrasted with "asat" (non-being, falsehood, or that which is transient)

### Ontological Significance

- In the deepest philosophical sense, satya refers to ultimate reality or Brahman
- The Chandogya Upanishad states: "Satya eva jayate" (Truth alone triumphs)
- The nature of reality (sat) is considered eternal, unchanging, and absolute

### Epistemological Dimension

- Satya refers to truthful knowledge and correct perception
- The goal of philosophical inquiry is to discern satya from untruth or illusion (maya)
- Various schools of Hindu philosophy developed different means (pramanas) to ascertain truth
