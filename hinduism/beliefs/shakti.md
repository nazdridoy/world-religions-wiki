# Shakti - The Divine Feminine Power

![Symbolic representation of Shakti](shakti_durga.jpg)

Shakti, meaning "power" or "energy" in Sanskrit, represents the divine feminine creative power in Hinduism. It is the primordial cosmic energy that animates all existence and is personified as the feminine aspect of the divine. Shakti is both a philosophical concept and a goddess, embodying the active principle that brings the universe into being.

## Core Concept

Shakti represents the dynamic, active aspect of divinity, often contrasted with the static masculine principle:

- **Universal Energy**: The fundamental force that powers all cosmic processes
- **Divine Feminine**: The feminine aspect of the godhead
- **Creative Force**: The power that enables creation, preservation, and dissolution
- **Kundalini**: The latent spiritual energy residing at the base of the spine in every individual

## Theological Understanding

### In Relation to the Divine Masculine

In Hindu philosophy, Shakti is inseparable from the divine masculine principle:

- **Shiva-Shakti**: Shakti is often conceptualized as the consort of Shiva, representing his creative power
- **Purusha-Prakriti**: In Samkhya philosophy, Shakti corresponds to Prakriti (primordial nature) in relation to Purusha (consciousness)
- **Brahman-Maya**: In Advaita Vedanta, Shakti is related to Maya, the creative power of Brahman

The relationship is described in various ways:
- As complementary polarities (like yin and yang)
- As the active and passive aspects of a single reality
- As the power (Shakti) and the possessor of power (Shaktiman)

### The Principle of Non-Duality

In many Hindu traditions, particularly Tantra:
- Shakti and Shiva are ultimately non-dual
- They represent two aspects of the same ultimate reality
- Neither can exist without the other
- Their union (yoga) represents enlightenment and cosmic harmony

## Manifestations of Shakti

- **Lakshmi**: The aspect of prosperity, abundance, and auspiciousness
