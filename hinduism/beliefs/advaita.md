# Advaita Vedanta - Non-dualism

![Representation of Advaita philosophy](advaita_symbol.jpg)

Advaita Vedanta is one of the most influential sub-schools of Vedanta, a Hindu philosophical tradition focused on the interpretation of the Upanishads. Advaita, meaning "non-duality," teaches that the individual self (Atman) is identical with the ultimate reality (Brahman), and the perception of difference is due to ignorance (avidya).

## Core Principles

### Non-Dualism (Advaita)

The fundamental principle of Advaita Vedanta is that reality is non-dual. According to this philosophy:

- Brahman is the only truth
- The world, as we perceive it, is an illusion (maya)
- The individual soul (jivatman) is not different from Brahman
- The experience of duality and multiplicity is due to ignorance (avidya)

### Levels of Reality

Advaita recognizes three levels of reality:

1. **Paramarthika** (Absolute Reality) - The unchanging, eternal Brahman; the only true reality
2. **Vyavaharika** (Empirical Reality) - The world of everyday experience, which has practical utility but is ontologically unreal
3. **Pratibhasika** (Illusory Reality) - Hallucinations, dreams, and misperceptions that are subjectively real but objectively false

### Maya and Avidya

- **Maya** is the cosmic illusion that creates the appearance of multiplicity from the non-dual Brahman
- **Avidya** is individual ignorance that causes one to misapprehend reality and identify with the body-mind complex

## Historical Development

### Origins and Early Development

While advaitic ideas can be found in the Upanishads, Advaita Vedanta as a systematic philosophy was primarily formulated by Adi Shankaracharya (788-820 CE). Building on the work of his predecessors like Gaudapada, Shankara established Advaita as one of the most influential schools of Hindu philosophy.

### Key Texts

- **Brahma Sutras** with Shankara's commentary
- **Principal Upanishads** with Shankara's commentaries
- **Bhagavad Gita** with Shankara's commentary
- **Viveka Chudamani** (Crest-Jewel of Discrimination) by Shankara
- **Upadeshasahasri** (A Thousand Teachings) by Shankara
- **Aparokshanubhuti** (Direct Experience of Reality) attributed to Shankara

## Philosophical Framework

### Epistemology

Advaita recognizes six pramanas (valid means of knowledge):
- Pratyaksha (perception)
- Anumana (inference)
- Upamana (comparison)
- Arthapatti (postulation)
- Anupalabdhi (non-apprehension)
- Shabda (testimony) - particularly the Vedas and other authoritative texts

### Theory of Existence

- **Satkaaryavaada** - The effect pre-exists in the cause
- **Vivartavada** - The world is an apparent manifestation of Brahman, like a rope mistaken for a snake

### Key Concepts

- **Sat-chit-ananda** - Being-consciousness-bliss, the nature of Brahman and true Self
- **Neti neti** - "Not this, not this," the negative method of defining Brahman
- **Tat tvam asi** - "That thou art," one of the Mahavakyas (great statements) indicating identity of Atman and Brahman

## Path to Liberation

### The Four Qualifications (Sadhana Chatushtaya)

Prerequisites for pursuing spiritual knowledge:
1. **Viveka** - Discrimination between the eternal and transient
2. **Vairagya** - Dispassion toward worldly objects
3. **Shatsampatti** - Six virtues (mind control, sense restraint, etc.)
4. **Mumukshutva** - Intense desire for liberation

### Three Steps to Enlightenment

1. **Shravana** - Listening to the teachings of a qualified guru
2. **Manana** - Reflecting and contemplating on these teachings
3. **Nididhyasana** - Meditation on the truth until direct realization

### Jivan Mukti

Advaita teaches that liberation (moksha) can be attained while still living in the body. The Jivan Mukta (liberated while alive) lives free from identification with the body-mind complex, experiencing the unity of all existence.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Modern Proponents

- **Swami Vivekananda** (1863-1902) - Introduced Advaita to the Western world
- **Ramana Maharshi** (1879-1950) - Taught self-inquiry as the direct path to Self-realization
- **Nisargadatta Maharaj** (1897-1981) - Emphasized the understanding of "I am" as the path to truth

### Global Influence

Advaita Vedanta has influenced:
- Modern spiritual movements
- Western philosophy, particularly through Schopenhauer
- Quantum physics interpretations
- Transpersonal psychology

## Criticisms and Alternative Views

### From Other Vedanta Schools

- **Vishishtadvaita** criticizes Advaita for not accounting for the reality of individual experience
- **Dvaita** argues that the differences between God, souls, and matter are real and eternal
- **Achintya Bheda Abheda** proposes that the relationship between Brahman and the world is simultaneously one and different in an inconceivable way

### Modern Critiques

- Questions about the social implications of non-dualism
- Debates about interpretations of key texts
- Discussions about the practical applications of Advaita in daily life
