This article explores the core concepts of Hindu tantra and their significance within the broader Hindu philosophical landscape.

## Core Philosophical Concepts

### Non-Dualism (Advaita)

  - **Maya**: Creative power that manifests the world
  - **Matrikas**: Subtle sound energies
- Inseparable from Shiva (pure consciousness)

### The Five Acts of Shiva
Tantra views reality as manifesting through five divine actions:
1. **Creation** (Srishti): Manifestation from pure consciousness
2. **Maintenance** (Sthiti): Sustaining of manifest reality
3. **Dissolution** (Samhara): Withdrawal back into source
4. **Concealment** (Tirodhana): Veiling of true nature
5. **Grace** (Anugraha): Revelation and liberation
