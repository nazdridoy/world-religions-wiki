# Hindu Cosmology

![Cosmic representation of Hindu universe](hindu_cosmology.jpg)

Hindu cosmology presents a complex and sophisticated understanding of the universe's structure, origin, and evolution. Unlike linear Western cosmologies, Hindu cosmology envisions a cyclic universe with multiple dimensions of existence, vast time scales, and an intricate relationship between the physical and metaphysical realms.

## Origins of the Universe

Hindu texts offer various accounts of creation, reflecting the diversity of philosophical perspectives within the tradition:

### Nasadiya Sukta (Hymn of Creation)

The Rigveda's Nasadiya Sukta (10.129) begins with a profound philosophical inquiry into existence before creation:

> "There was neither non-existence nor existence then;
> There was neither the realm of space nor the sky which is beyond.
> What stirred? Where? In whose protection?
> Was there water, bottomlessly deep?"

This hymn suggests that even the gods came after creation and questions whether anyone, even the highest deity, truly knows how the universe came into being.

### Hiranyagarbha (Golden Egg)

The Rigveda also describes creation through Hiranyagarbha, the "golden embryo" or "golden womb" that floated in emptiness before breaking apart to form heaven and earth:

> "In the beginning was the Divinity in his splendor, manifested as the sole Lord of land, skies, water, space and that beneath and He upheld the earth and the heavens."

### Purusha Sukta

Another important creation account appears in the Purusha Sukta, which describes the sacrifice of a cosmic being (Purusha) whose dismembered body parts became various aspects of the universe:
- His mind became the moon
- His eyes became the sun
- His head became the sky
- His feet became the earth

### Brahma and Creation

In Puranic cosmology, the universe is created by Brahma, who emerges from a lotus growing from Vishnu's navel as he sleeps on the cosmic waters. Brahma proceeds to create the worlds and beings through various means, including:
- Mental creation (forming beings through thought)
- Physical creation (creating beings from his body parts)
- Secondary creation (delegating creation to other beings)

## Structure of the Universe

### Cosmic Geography

The Hindu universe is visualized as a complex structure with multiple planes of existence:

#### Cosmic Egg (Brahmanda)

The universe is envisioned as a cosmic egg (Brahmanda) floating in the causal waters. This egg contains:

- **Seven upper worlds** (lokas): Bhuloka (Earth), Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, and Satyaloka
- **Seven lower worlds** (patalas): Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala, and Patala
- **Mount Meru**: The cosmic mountain at the center of the universe
- **Seven concentric island continents** (dvipas): Jambudvipa at the center, surrounded by six others, each separated by oceans
- **Celestial bodies**: The sun, moon, planets, and stars that revolve around Mount Meru

#### Three Worlds (Triloka)

A simpler model divides the cosmos into three main realms:
- **Svarga** (heaven): Realm of devas (gods)
- **Prithvi** (earth): Realm of humans and other terrestrial beings
- **Patala** (netherworld): Realm of nagas (serpent beings) and asuras (demons)

## Cosmic Time

### Measurements of Time

Hindu cosmology operates on vast time scales:

- **Yuga** (age): Four yugas make up one cycle of time
  - Satya Yuga: 1,728,000 human years
  - Treta Yuga: 1,296,000 human years
  - Dvapara Yuga: 864,000 human years
  - Kali Yuga: 432,000 human years

- **Mahayuga** (great age): One complete cycle of four yugas (4,320,000 years)
- **Manvantara**: Period of one Manu (progenitor of humanity), equal to 71 Mahayugas
- **Kalpa** (day of Brahma): Consists of 14 Manvantaras (4.32 billion years)
- **Life of Brahma**: 100 Brahma years (311 trillion human years)

### Cyclic Nature of the Universe

The universe undergoes endless cycles of:
- **Creation** (Srishti): Emergence of the universe
- **Preservation** (Sthiti): Maintenance of cosmic order
- **Dissolution** (Pralaya): Periodic destruction at the end of a kalpa
- **Mahapralaya**: Complete dissolution at the end of Brahma's life

After each dissolution, a period of cosmic rest occurs before creation begins anew.

## Multiple Universes

Many Hindu texts describe not just one universe but countless universes:

- Each universe has its own Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva
- Universes are described as bubbles in an infinite ocean
- Some texts describe universes emerging like pores in Vishnu's skin
- The Bhagavata Purana states that even if one could count all the atoms in the universe, one could not count all the universes

## Philosophical Interpretations

Different schools of Hindu philosophy interpret cosmology in various ways:

### Samkhya View

- The manifest universe emerges from the interaction between consciousness (Purusha) and primordial matter (Prakriti)
- Evolution of the cosmos occurs through the unfoldment of 24 tattvas (principles)
- Material creation is guided by the three gunas (qualities): sattva, rajas, and tamas

### Advaita Vedanta View

- The universe is ultimately maya (illusion) or a lower level of reality
- Brahman is the only absolute reality; the manifest cosmos is its appearance
- The world is neither fully real nor unreal but has a dependent reality

### Vishishtadvaita View

- The universe is the body of God, real and not illusory
- Matter (acit) and souls (cit) form the body of Brahman
- The universe undergoes real transformations but remains dependent on God

## Scientific Perspectives

Some modern scholars have noted parallels between Hindu cosmology and contemporary scientific theories:

- The cyclic nature of the universe bears resemblance to oscillating universe theories
- The vast time scales anticipated modern understanding of cosmic time
- The concept of multiple universes parallels multiverse theories
- The description of the universe emerging from a concentrated point has been compared to the Big Bang theory

However, it's important to note that Hindu cosmology operates in a spiritual framework with different purposes and methodologies than modern science.

## Influence on Culture and Practice

Hindu cosmology has profoundly shaped Indian culture:

- **Art and Architecture**: Temple design often reflects cosmic geography
- **Ritual Practice**: Many rituals symbolically recreate cosmic events
- **Calendar Systems**: Traditional Hindu calendars are based on cosmological time cycles
- **Meditation Practices**: Visualization of cosmic structures is incorporated into spiritual practices
- **Ethical Frameworks**: The cyclical nature of time influences attitudes about impermanence and moral action
