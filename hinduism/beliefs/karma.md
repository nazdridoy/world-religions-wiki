# Karma - The Law of Cause and Effect

![Symbolic representation of karma](karma_wheel.jpg)

Karma is one of the foundational concepts in Hindu philosophy and refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence their future (effect). Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and better rebirth, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and worse rebirth.

## Core Principles of Karma

### Definition and Etymology

The word "karma" comes from the Sanskrit root "kri" (कृ), meaning "to do" or "to make." It literally means "action" or "deed." In its broader sense, karma includes:

- Physical actions
- Verbal actions (speech)
- Mental actions (thoughts)

### The Universal Law

The law of karma operates on the principle that every action has consequences, similar to Newton's third law of motion: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." However, karma extends beyond the physical realm to include moral and spiritual dimensions.

### Three Types of Karma

According to Hindu texts, karma can be categorized into three types:

1. **Sanchita Karma** (accumulated karma): The total accumulated karma from all past lives that has yet to be resolved.

2. **Prarabdha Karma** (destiny): The portion of Sanchita Karma that is assigned for resolution in the current lifetime and determines one's circumstances at birth.

3. **Kriyamana Karma** (current karma): The karma being created in the present through current actions, which will affect future experiences either in this life or future ones.

## Karma in Hindu Scriptures

### In the Vedas

The concept of karma first appears in the Rigveda, though not fully developed as in later texts. It was initially connected with ritual action and sacrifice.

### In the Upanishads

The Upanishads expanded the concept of karma beyond ritual to include moral and ethical dimensions. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states: "According to what one does, according to how one acts, so does one become."

### In the Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita introduces the concept of Nishkama Karma (selfless action), where Krishna advises Arjuna to perform his duty without attachment to results:

"You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction." (Chapter 2, Verse 47)

### In the Puranas

The Puranas contain numerous stories illustrating the workings of karma, often through tales of reincarnation and moral lessons about the consequences of good and bad actions.

## Karma and Related Concepts

### Karma and Samsara

Karma is intrinsically linked to Samsara, the cycle of death and rebirth. The quality of one's karma determines the nature of future births and experiences within the cycle.

### Karma and Free Will

Hinduism recognizes the interplay between determinism (karma from past actions) and free will (new actions). While one may be bound by past karma, one always has the freedom to choose current actions, thereby influencing future karma.

### Karma and Moksha

The ultimate goal in Hinduism is Moksha (liberation) from the cycle of Samsara. This involves transcending karma altogether by:
- Exhausting all accumulated karma
- Avoiding the creation of new karma
- Attaining spiritual knowledge that frees one from karmic bonds

## Misconceptions About Karma

### Karma is Not Fatalism

Many misunderstand karma as a form of fatalism or predetermination. However, Hindu philosophy emphasizes that individuals always have the agency to make choices that can alter their karmic trajectory.

### Karma is Not Immediate Retribution

Karma does not necessarily manifest immediately after an action. Effects may appear at any time—in this life or future lives—when conditions are appropriate.

### Karma is Not Reward and Punishment

Karma is not administered by an external deity as reward or punishment. It is an impersonal, natural law operating throughout the cosmos, similar to physical laws like gravity.

## Karma in Different Hindu Traditions

### In Vedanta

Various schools of Vedanta interpret karma differently:
- **Advaita Vedanta**: Ultimate liberation comes from realizing the illusory nature of karma along with all duality
- **Dvaita Vedanta**: Karma operates under the supervision of Vishnu/Krishna
- **Vishishtadvaita**: Karma functions within the divine plan of a personal God

### In Yoga

In Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, karma is seen as creating samskaras (mental impressions) that shape one's personality and tendencies. Yoga aims to burn these impressions through spiritual practice.

### In Vaishnavism

Vaishnavas emphasize Bhakti (devotion) as a means to transcend karma. By surrendering to Krishna/Vishnu, one can be freed from karmic reactions.

### In Shaivism

Shaivite traditions often view Shiva as the lord of karma, who can help devotees transcend karmic bonds through grace.

## Modern Interpretations and Influence

### Karma in Contemporary Hinduism

Contemporary Hindu teachers often emphasize the practical, ethical dimensions of karma—encouraging positive actions and intentions while acknowledging the complexity of karmic consequences.

### Global Influence

The concept of karma has spread globally and influenced various spiritual and philosophical movements beyond Hinduism, including New Age spirituality and popular psychology.
