![Devotee in worship](bhakti_devotion.jpg)

Bhakti refers to devotional worship and love directed toward a personal conception of the Divine. The term derives from the Sanskrit root "bhaj," meaning "to share in" or "to belong to," and represents a deeply emotional and intimate relationship between devotee and deity. Bhakti has been one of the most influential and widespread spiritual movements within Hinduism for over a millennium.

## Core Principles

### Nature of Bhakti

Bhakti is characterized by:

- **Personal Relationship**: An intimate, loving connection with a chosen deity
- **Emotional Engagement**: Cultivation of feelings like love, longing, and surrender
- **Accessibility**: Available to all regardless of caste, gender, or social status
- **Directness**: Emphasis on direct experience rather than intellectual understanding
- **Devotional Practices**: Expressed through various forms of worship and service

### Theological Foundations

The basis for bhakti varies across traditions but commonly includes:

- God's grace (prasada) as essential for spiritual liberation
- Divine love as reciprocal, with God responding to sincere devotion
- The soul's natural longing for union with the Divine
- Devotion as a valid and direct path to spiritual fulfillment

## Historical Development

### Early Roots

While devotional elements appear in the Vedas and Upanishads, bhakti as a defined path emerged more clearly in the late Vedic period:

- The Shvetashvatara Upanishad emphasizes devotion to God
- The Bhagavad Gita (c. 200 BCE) presents bhakti as a primary spiritual path
- Early bhakti elements appear in the worship of Vasudeva-Krishna

### The Bhakti Movement

The most significant development was the Bhakti Movement (c. 7th-17th centuries CE):

- Began in South India with the Alvars (Vaishnava) and Nayanars (Shaiva)
- Spread northward through the influence of saints and poet-mystics
- Flourished in different regional forms across India
- Challenged caste orthodoxy and ritual formalism
- Produced rich devotional literature in vernacular languages
