# Vishishtadvaita - Qualified Non-Dualism in Hinduism

![Ramanuja, founder of Vishishtadvaita](ramanuja.jpg)

Vishishtadvaita, or "qualified non-dualism," represents one of the most influential schools of Vedanta philosophy in Hinduism. Systematized by Sri Ramanuja (1017-1137 CE), this theological and philosophical system offers a middle path between the absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta and the strict dualism of Dvaita Vedanta. It provides a sophisticated framework for understanding the relationship between God, souls, and the world that has profoundly shaped Hindu devotional traditions.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Pre-Ramanuja Influences
- Rooted in the ancient Pancaratra and Vaikhanasa agamic traditions
- Philosophical foundations in the Alvars' Tamil devotional poetry (6th-9th centuries CE)
- Early systematization by teachers like Nathamuni (10th century) and Yamunacharya (Alavandar)
- Draws on Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, and especially the Brahma Sutras

### Ramanuja's Life and Contributions
- Born in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu, in 1017 CE
- Studied under various teachers, including Yadavaprakasha
- Eventually became the head of the Sri Rangam temple
- Composed nine influential works, including:
  - Sri Bhashya (commentary on Brahma Sutras)
  - Vedartha Sangraha (summary of Upanishadic teachings)
  - Gita Bhashya (commentary on Bhagavad Gita)
- Established the organizational foundation for Sri Vaishnavism
- Lived over 120 years according to tradition

### Post-Ramanuja Developments
- Division into two sub-traditions:
  - Vadakalai (northern school): Greater emphasis on Sanskrit texts
  - Tenkalai (southern school): Greater emphasis on Tamil devotional literature
- Expansion through figures like Vedanta Deshika and Pillai Lokacharya
- Influence on other Vaishnava traditions across India
- Development of extensive commentarial literature

## Core Philosophical Concepts

### The Three Fundamental Realities (Tattvas)
Vishishtadvaita recognizes three eternal, real entities:

1. **Ishvara (God)**: The Supreme Being, identified as Narayana/Vishnu
   - Independent existence (svatantra)
   - Possessed of all auspicious qualities
   - Both the material and efficient cause of the universe
   - Personal deity with form and attributes

2. **Chit (Souls)**: The multitude of individual souls
   - Eternally distinct from God yet fundamentally related
   - Possess consciousness and knowledge as essential attributes
   - Atomic in size but pervade their respective bodies
   - Dependent on God for existence and liberation

3. **Achit (Matter)**: The non-conscious substance
   - Undergoes continuous transformation
   - Comprises the entire material cosmos
   - Exists in subtle (sukshma) and gross (sthula) states
   - Real, not illusory, but dependent on God

### The Nature of Brahman
- Brahman is identified specifically as Narayana/Vishnu
- Possesses infinite auspicious qualities (kalyana gunas)
- Both transcendent (beyond the world) and immanent (within the world)
- Characterized by:
  - Satyam (truth)
  - Jnanam (knowledge)
  - Anandam (bliss)
  - Amalatvam (purity)
  - Anantatvam (infinity)

### The Body-Soul Analogy
A key metaphor in Vishishtadvaita:
- The universe (chit and achit) constitutes the "body" of God
- God "ensouling" the universe as the inner controller (antaryamin)
- Relationship is described as:
  - Aprthak-siddhi: Inseparable existence
  - Adhara-adheya: Supporter-supported
  - Niyantri-niyamya: Controller-controlled
  - Shesha-sheshi: Subordinate-principal

### The Qualified Non-Dualism Concept
- "Qualified" (vishishta) refers to Brahman qualified by:
  - Conscious beings (chit)
  - Non-conscious matter (achit)
- Unity (advaita) in diversityâ€”one reality with internal distinctions
- Distinct from both:
  - Advaita's absolute identity of all reality
  - Dvaita's absolute separation of realities

## Theological System

### Doctrine of God
- **Narayana/Vishnu** as the Supreme Being possessing:
  - Transcendent form (para)
  - Manifestation as divine incarnations (vyuha)
  - Descent into the world as avatars (vibhava)
  - Presence in images and icons (archa)
  - Immanence within all beings (antaryamin)
- Relationship with **Lakshmi** (divine consort) as:
  - Inseparable from Narayana
  - Mediator between God and souls
  - Possessing the quality of pure mercy

### Understanding of Creation
- Creation as real transformation (parinama), not illusion
- Cyclical manifestation and dissolution of the cosmos
- Material world evolves from subtle to gross state
- Brahman as both material and efficient cause
- Creation as divine sport (lila) and expression of glory

### Theory of Knowledge (Epistemology)
- Three valid sources of knowledge (pramanas):
  - Perception (pratyaksha)
  - Inference (anumana)
  - Testimony (shabda), especially Vedic revelation
- Knowledge as attribute of the self, not identical with it
- Ultimate knowledge comes through scripture properly interpreted
- Direct intuitive knowledge possible through devotion

### View of the Individual Self (Jiva)
- Eternally real and distinct from God
- Possessing consciousness as its essential nature
- Exists in three states:
  - Bound (baddha): Subject to samsara
  - Liberated (mukta): Released from material existence
  - Ever-free (nitya): Never entered material existence
- Self as agent (karta) with real but limited freedom

## Spiritual Philosophy and Practice

### Path to Liberation
- Bhakti (devotion) as the primary means to liberation
- Three interconnected paths:
  - Karma Yoga: Selfless action
  - Jnana Yoga: Knowledge and discrimination
  - Bhakti Yoga: Loving devotion
- Supported by proper conduct and ritual observances

### Doctrine of Grace (Prapatti)
- Complete surrender (prapatti) to divine grace
- Requirements for prapatti:
  - Anukulyasya sankalpa: Resolution to do what pleases God
  - Pratikulyasya varjanam: Avoidance of what displeases God
  - Mahavishvasa: Absolute faith in divine protection
  - Goptrtva-varanam: Choosing God as one's protector
  - Atma-nikshepa: Surrender of self
  - Karpanya: Sense of utter helplessness
- Disagreements between schools about self-effort versus divine grace

### State of Liberation (Moksha)
- Liberation as positive communion with God, not mere cessation of suffering
- Liberated soul retains individual identity
- Experiences bliss of divine service
- Freed from karmic bonds and material limitations
- Participates in divine qualities except cosmic functions

### Ethical Framework
- Dharma (righteousness) as foundation of spiritual life
- Cultivation of divine qualities:
  - Compassion (daya)
  - Patience (kshama)
  - Non-violence (ahimsa)
  - Purity (saucha)
  - Truthfulness (satya)
- Social ethics based on varnashrama dharma with emphasis on service

## Scriptural Interpretation

### Approach to Vedic Texts
- Harmony of all legitimate scriptures when properly understood
- Six means of interpretation (shadvidha-tatparya-linga):
  - Upakrama-upasamhara: Consistency between beginning and conclusion
  - Abhyasa: Repetition indicating importance
  - Apurvata: Novelty of subject matter
  - Phala: Fruit or result
  - Arthavada: Explanatory passages
  - Upapatti: Logical reasoning
- Integration of Sanskrit Vedic tradition with Tamil devotional texts

### Distinctive Interpretations
- Mahavakyas ("Great Statements") interpreted differently from Advaita:
  - "Tat tvam asi" ("That thou art") interpreted as showing relationship, not identity
  - "Aham Brahmasmi" ("I am Brahman") interpreted as showing dependence, not identity
- Emphasis on personal aspects of Brahman over impersonal aspects
- Reading of texts through theistic, devotional lens

### Canonical Texts
- Vedas (especially Upanishads)
- Brahma Sutras with Ramanuja's Sri Bhashya commentary
- Bhagavad Gita with Ramanuja's Gita Bhashya
- Divya Prabandham (Tamil hymns of the Alvars)
- Pancharatra Agamas
- Vishnu Purana and other Vaishnava Puranas

## Relationship to Other Vedanta Schools

### Contrast with Advaita Vedanta
- Rejects the concept of world as illusion (maya)
- Maintains real distinction between God and souls
- Emphasizes personal rather than impersonal absolute
- Recognizes devotion as primary means rather than knowledge alone
- Views liberation as communion with God, not absorption

### Comparison with Dvaita Vedanta
- Shares theistic orientation and emphasis on Vishnu/Narayana
- Both acknowledge real distinction between God, souls, and matter
- Vishishtadvaita sees closer connection between God and creation
- Less emphasis on eternal hierarchy of souls
- More optimistic about universal salvation potential

### Middle Position Among Vedanta Schools
- Offers synthesis between monistic and dualistic perspectives
- Balances emphasis on divine transcendence and immanence
- Integrates knowledge traditions with devotional approaches
- Combines philosophical sophistication with religious practice
- Provides framework accommodating both unity and diversity

## Ritual and Practice
