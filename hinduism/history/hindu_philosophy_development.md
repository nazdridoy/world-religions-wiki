The development of Hindu philosophy represents one of humanity's most sophisticated intellectual achievements, spanning over 1,500 years of continuous evolution. From the speculative insights of the Upanishads to the systematic schools of classical Indian thought, Hindu philosophical traditions addressed fundamental questions about reality, knowledge, consciousness, ethics, and liberation through rigorous logical analysis and spiritual insight.

## Early Foundations
