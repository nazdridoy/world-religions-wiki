Vedic religion refers to the historical religious practices and beliefs of the Indo-Aryan peoples who settled in the Indian subcontinent during the 2nd millennium BCE. This religious system formed the foundation of what would later develop into Hinduism.

## Evolution and Transformations

### Early Vedic Period (1500-1100 BCE)

## Legacy

Vedic religion provided the foundation for numerous elements of later Hinduism:

- **Ritual Principles**: Though transformed, many ritual structures survived
- **Sacred Language**: Sanskrit remained the liturgical language
- **Deity Evolution**: Many Vedic gods evolved into Hindu deities
- **Social Structures**: Varna system developed into the caste system
- **Sacred Texts**: The Vedas remain revered as Hinduism's most sacred texts

## Differences from Modern Hinduism

- **Deity Focus**: Vedic religion emphasized deities like Indra and Agni who became less prominent in later Hinduism

- **Philosophy**: Less focused on concepts like moksha that became central to later Hinduism
- **Social Structure**: Less rigid social divisions than later caste system

## Historical Significance

The Vedic religion represents one of the world's oldest documented religious traditions. Its extensive texts provide unique insights into the development of Indo-European religious thought and the foundations of South Asian religious culture.
