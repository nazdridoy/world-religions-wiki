Early Hinduism, particularly its Vedic phase, shows significant connections to the broader Indo-European cultural and religious traditions. These connections provide important context for understanding the development of Hindu religious concepts and practices.

## Linguistic Foundations

### The Indo-European Language Family

- **Sanskrit's Position**: Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European language family
- **Cognate Languages**: Related to Ancient Greek, Latin, Old Persian, Avestan, and other European and Asian languages
- **Linguistic Evidence**: Comparative linguistics reveals shared vocabulary and grammatical structures

## Divergence from Indo-European Patterns

While sharing many features with other Indo-European traditions, Vedic and later Hindu religion also developed unique characteristics:

- **c. 1800-1500 BCE**: Separation of Indo-Aryan and Iranian branches
- **c. 1500-1200 BCE**: Indo-Aryan migration into Indian subcontinent
- **c. 1500-500 BCE**: Vedic period with strongest Indo-European characteristics

## Scholarly Approaches

### Comparative Mythology

- **Max Müller**: Pioneer in comparative Indo-European mythology

## Significance for Hindu Studies
