The development of systematic theological and philosophical schools represents a crucial aspect of Hindu intellectual history. These schools (darśanas) emerged as structured attempts to interpret sacred texts, explain reality, and provide paths to spiritual liberation. This page explores the historical formation and evolution of these influential systems of thought.

## Pre-Systematic Period (800-400 BCE)

- **Lack of Systematization**: Ideas presented without formal logical structures or complete systems

### Nascent Philosophical Trends
