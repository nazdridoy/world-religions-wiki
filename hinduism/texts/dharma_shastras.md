# Dharma Shastras - Ancient Hindu Legal and Ethical Texts

![Dharma Shastra manuscript](dharma_shastra_manuscript.jpg)

The Dharma Shastras comprise an extensive corpus of Sanskrit texts that form the foundation of Hindu law, social customs, religious duties, and ethical principles. Considered a subset of the Smriti literature, these texts codified the rules and regulations governing individual conduct, social interactions, and religious practices across different strata of traditional Hindu society. For over two millennia, the Dharma Shastras served as authoritative guides for kings, judges, community leaders, and individuals seeking to live in accordance with dharma (righteousness).

## Overview and Historical Development

  - Developed into more systematic and comprehensive Dharma Shastras
  - Later elaborated through extensive commentaries (bhashyas) and digests (nibandhas)
