The Puranas ("ancient tales") are a vast body of Sanskrit literature that emerged in post-Vedic India, containing narratives about the creation of the universe, mythology, cosmology, genealogies of kings, heroes, sages, and demigods, and descriptions of Hindu philosophy and geography. These encyclopedic texts have profoundly shaped Hindu religious practices and beliefs across the centuries.

## Key Characteristics

- **Purpose**: To present complex philosophical and religious ideas through accessible stories
- **Composition Period**: Approximately 300-1000 CE, though containing much older material
- **Language**: Classical Sanskrit
- **Scope**: Comprehensive treatment of cosmology, mythology, religious practices, and history
- **Literary Style**: Narrative prose and verse combining stories, dialogues, and instructions
- **Classification**: Categorized as Smriti (remembered) texts, as opposed to Shruti (revealed) texts like the Vedas

## The Five Characteristics (Pancha-Lakshana)

Traditionally, a Purana is defined as having five characteristic topics (pancha-lakshana):

1. **Sarga** (Primary Creation) - The creation of the universe
2. **Pratisarga** (Secondary Creation) - Recreation after periodic dissolution
3. **Vamsha** (Genealogy) - Lineages of gods, sages, and kings
4. **Manvantara** (Cosmic Cycles) - The eras of various Manus (progenitors of humanity)
5. **Vamshanucharita** (Dynastic Histories) - Chronicles of royal dynasties

Over time, additional topics were incorporated, including:
- Detailed descriptions of sacred places (tirthas)
