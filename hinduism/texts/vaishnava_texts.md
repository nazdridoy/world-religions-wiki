Vaishnava texts constitute a vast corpus of literature centered on the worship of Vishnu and his various incarnations, particularly Krishna and Rama. These texts span multiple genres, languages, and historical periods, forming the scriptural foundation for Vaishnavism, the largest denomination within Hinduism.

## Categories of Vaishnava Texts

### Canonical Sanskrit Texts

#### Vedic References

Though Vishnu appears in the Vedas, his prominence is limited compared to deities like Indra:
- The **Rigveda** mentions Vishnu as the one who measured the universe in three strides
- The **Yajurveda** expands on Vishnu's cosmic role
- The **Upanishads** contain references that later Vaishnava commentators interpret as indicating Vishnu's supremacy

#### Vaishnava Puranas

Among the 18 major Puranas, six are specifically Vaishnava in orientation:
- **Vishnu Purana**: Foundational text detailing Vishnu's cosmic activities and incarnations
