# Shakta Texts

![Ancient manuscript of Devi Mahatmya](shakta_manuscript.jpg)

Shakta texts comprise a vast corpus of literature centered on the worship of the divine feminine (Shakti), understood variously as the Supreme Goddess, the power of the divine, or the dynamic feminine aspect of ultimate reality. These texts span multiple languages, genres, and historical periods, forming the scriptural foundation for Shaktism, a major denomination within Hinduism that reveres the Goddess as the highest reality. From philosophical treatises to ritual manuals and devotional poetry, this textual tradition has profoundly shaped Hindu conceptions of divinity, power, and spiritual practice.

## Categories of Shakta Texts

While the fully developed Shakta tradition emerged later, elements of goddess worship appear in ancient Vedic literature:

- **Rigveda**: Contains hymns to goddesses like Ushas (dawn), Aditi (boundless heaven), and Vak (speech)
