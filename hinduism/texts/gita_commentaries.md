The Bhagavad Gita, or "Song of the Lord," is one of Hinduism's most revered texts. This 700-verse dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra has inspired countless commentaries over the centuries. These commentaries (bhashyas) not only interpret the Gita's teachings but also serve as vehicles for expressing diverse philosophical perspectives within Hinduism.

## Historical Development of Gita Commentaries

### Early Period (700-1200 CE)

The earliest known systematic commentary on the Bhagavad Gita is attributed to Shankara (8th century CE), though references to the text appear in earlier works. This period established the Gita as a foundational text worthy of serious philosophical exegesis.

### Classical Period (1200-1700 CE)

This era saw the development of major commentarial traditions as the heads of various Vedantic schools used the Gita to articulate their philosophical positions. Ramanuja, Madhva, Nimbarka, and Vallabha all composed influential commentaries during this period.

### Modern Period (1700 CE-Present)

Modern commentaries have emerged both from traditional lineages and from reform movements. This period has also seen the internationalization of the Gita, with commentaries appearing in multiple languages and traditions.
