# Interpretive Frameworks for Hindu Texts

![Ancient Hindu commentary manuscript](interpretive_manuscript.jpg)

Hindu textual traditions have developed sophisticated and diverse interpretive frameworks over thousands of years, creating a rich hermeneutical landscape that continues to evolve into the present day. These frameworks—ranging from traditional exegetical methods codified in classical Sanskrit works to contemporary critical approaches—provide methodological tools for understanding, applying, and reinterpreting Hindu sacred literature. Each interpretive tradition establishes specific principles for resolving textual contradictions, hierarchizing diverse scriptural sources, and extracting meaning relevant to different contexts and purposes. Understanding these interpretive frameworks is essential for appreciating how Hindu texts have remained vital and applicable across dramatically different historical, cultural, and philosophical environments.

## Traditional Interpretive Systems

### Mimamsa Hermeneutics

The Mimamsa school developed the most systematic traditional approach to textual interpretation in Hindu thought:

  - **Hierarchical Text Classification**: Distinguishing primary (shruti) from secondary (smriti) texts
  - **Contextual Integration**: Methods for resolving apparent contradictions
