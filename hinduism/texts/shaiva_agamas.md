# Shaiva Agamas - Texts of Shiva Worship

![Ancient Shaiva Agama manuscript](shaiva_agama_manuscript.jpg)

The Shaiva Agamas are a collection of Sanskrit texts that form the scriptural foundation for Shaivism, the Hindu tradition centered on the worship of Lord Shiva. These authoritative texts detail temple architecture, ritual practices, philosophical doctrines, and yogic disciplines related to Shiva worship.

## Overview and Significance

The Shaiva Agamas are considered direct revelations from Lord Shiva himself. Within Shaivism, they hold equal or sometimes greater authority than the Vedas for matters of worship, temple construction, and spiritual practice. These texts are essential for:

- Guiding temple rituals and priesthood
- Establishing correct methods of Shiva worship
- Providing philosophical frameworks for understanding Shiva's nature
- Outlining yogic and tantric practices for spiritual advancement
- Detailing iconography and temple architecture principles

## Classification and Structure

The Shaiva Agamas are typically classified into three major groups:

### Siddhanta Agamas (28 texts)
These form the scriptural basis for Shaiva Siddhanta, a prominent school of Shaivism especially influential in South India. The 28 principal Siddhanta Agamas are:

1. **Kamika**
2. **Yogaja**
3. **Chintya**
4. **Karana**
5. **Ajita**
6. **Dipta**
7. **Sukshma**
8. **Sahasra**
9. **Amshuman**
10. **Suprabhedha**
11. **Vijaya**
12. **Nihshvasa**
13. **Svayambhuva**
14. **Anala**
15. **Vira**
16. **Raurava**
17. **Makuta**
18. **Vimala**
19. **Chandrajnana**
20. **Mukhabimba**
21. **Prodgita**
22. **Lalita**
23. **Siddha**
24. **Santana**
25. **Sarvokta**
26. **Paramesvara**
27. **Kirana**
28. **Vatula/Parahita**

### Bhairava Agamas (64 texts)
Associated with the fierce form of Shiva known as Bhairava, these texts often contain more esoteric and tantric elements. Many of these texts are now lost or exist only in fragments. Some notable ones include:

- **Svacchanda Tantra**
- **Netra Tantra**
- **Vijnanabhairava Tantra**
- **Mrigendra Agama**
- **Matanga Parameshvara Agama**

### Kashmir Shaivism Texts
While not strictly "Agamas" in the traditional sense, these influential texts form the scriptural basis for the non-dualistic Kashmir Shaivism tradition:

- **Shiva Sutras** of Vasugupta
- **Spanda Karikas**
- **Pratyabhijnahridayam**
- **Tantraloka** by Abhinavagupta

- Temple architecture and construction
- Installation and consecration of Shiva lingams
- Daily worship procedures
- Initiation rituals
- Various forms of Shiva

A principal text of the Bhairava Agamas, covering:

## Philosophical Concepts

### Shaiva Siddhanta Philosophy
The Siddhanta Agamas elaborate on this dualistic or pluralistic philosophy, which holds that:
- God (Shiva), souls, and the world are distinct realities
- Souls are bound by three impurities (malas)
- Liberation comes through Shiva's grace and initiation (diksha)
- After liberation, the soul attains similarity to Shiva but not identity

### Non-dualistic Shaivism
The Bhairava Agamas and Kashmir Shaiva texts often present a more non-dualistic view:
- Ultimate reality is Shiva as pure consciousness
- The world is a manifestation of Shiva's creative power (Shakti)
- Recognition (pratyabhijna) of one's true nature as Shiva leads to liberation
- Emphasis on direct experience rather than ritual alone

## Ritual Practices

### Temple Worship
The Agamas provide detailed instructions for:
- Daily temple rituals (nitya puja)
- Special occasion ceremonies (naimittika puja)
- Festival celebrations (utsava)
- Processions and chariot festivals (rathothsava)

### Lingam Worship
Central to Shaiva practice is the worship of the Shiva Lingam:
- Installation procedures (pratishtha)
- Bathing rituals (abhisheka)
- Offerings of flowers, incense, lamps, and food
- Recitation of mantras and hymns

### Initiation (Diksha)
The Agamas emphasize the importance of initiation:
- Different levels of initiation for different practitioners
- Transfer of spiritual energy from guru to disciple
- Purification of the soul's bonds
- Use of mantras, mandalas, and fire rituals in the process

## Historical Development and Transmission

### Origins and Dating
- **Traditional View**: Revealed directly by Shiva at the beginning of creation
