The Samaveda, or "Veda of Melodies," is the third of the four Vedas and contains a collection of sacred hymns meant to be sung during Vedic rituals. Its name derives from the Sanskrit terms "saman" (melody) and "veda" (knowledge), reflecting its musical nature and liturgical purpose.

## Key Characteristics

- **Purpose**: Provides the musical notation for chanting Rigvedic hymns during sacrifices
- **Composition Period**: Approximately 1200-1000 BCE
- **Language**: Vedic Sanskrit with musical notation
- **Length**: Contains approximately 1,875 verses
- **Musical Nature**: Oldest known example of a written musical tradition in India
- **Religious Role**: Forms the textual basis for the Udgatar priest, who sings the sacred chants during rituals

## Structure and Composition

### Sources and Arrangement

- Approximately 75 verses are original to the Samaveda, while the remaining 1,800 are derived from the Rigveda
- The same Rigvedic verses are often repeated with different melodies for different ritual contexts
- The verses are arranged according to their ritual application rather than their content

### Main Divisions

The Samaveda is traditionally divided into two major parts:

1. **Archika** (Collection of Verses)
   - **Purvarchika**: Contains verses addressed to Agni, Indra, and Soma
   - **Uttararchika**: Arranged according to rituals and ceremonies

2. **Gana** (Song Books)
   - **Grama-geya-gana**: Songs to be sung in villages
   - **Aranya-geya-gana**: Songs to be sung in the forests
   - **Uhya-gana**: Songs for public sacrifices
   - **Uhya-gana**: Songs for secret sacrifices

## Musical Elements

### Svaras (Musical Notes)

The Samaveda is the foundation of the Indian musical tradition and employs seven svaras (notes):
- Prathama (first)
- Dvitiya (second)
- Tritiya (third)
- Chaturtha (fourth)
- Mandra (low)
- Kruṣṭa (high)
- Atisvārya (very high)

These eventually evolved into the modern Indian musical scale: Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni.
