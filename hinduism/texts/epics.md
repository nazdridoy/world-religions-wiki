The Hindu epics are monumental narrative texts that form a central part of Hindu literature and culture. Known collectively as the Itihasa ("thus it happened"), these texts blend historical events with mythology, philosophy, and religious instruction to create comprehensive worldviews that have shaped Hindu thought for millennia. While technically classified as Smriti (remembered texts) rather than Shruti (revealed texts), the epics hold immense religious and cultural significance across all Hindu traditions.

## The Major Epics

Hinduism recognizes two principal epics:

### Ramayana

- **Author**: Traditionally attributed to the sage Valmiki
- **Length**: Approximately 24,000 verses in seven books (kandas)
- **Period of Composition**: Between 7th-3rd centuries BCE
- **Central Characters**: Rama (avatar of Vishnu), Sita, Lakshmana, Hanuman
- **Core Narrative**: The exile, trials, and eventual triumph of Prince Rama, whose wife Sita is abducted by the demon king Ravana
