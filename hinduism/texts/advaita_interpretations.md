# Advaita Interpretations - The Philosophy of Non-Dualism

![Advaita text manuscript page](advaita_manuscript.jpg)

Advaita Vedanta (Sanskrit: अद्वैत वेदान्त, "non-dual Vedanta") represents one of the most influential schools of Hindu philosophy, systematically interpreting the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Brahma Sutras through the lens of absolute non-dualism. This philosophical tradition asserts that Brahman (ultimate reality) alone exists, while the perceived multiplicity of existence is ultimately illusory. Formalized by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century CE, Advaita has profoundly shaped Hindu thought and continues to be a vibrant intellectual and spiritual tradition.

## Overview and Core Principles

Advaita Vedanta is founded on several fundamental principles:

- **Absolute Non-dualism**: Reality is fundamentally non-dual (advaita); Brahman alone exists without a second
- **Identity of Atman and Brahman**: The individual self (Atman) is identical with the ultimate reality (Brahman)
- **Doctrine of Maya**: The empirical world is an appearance (maya) superimposed upon Brahman
- **Three Levels of Reality**: Distinction between absolute (paramarthika), empirical (vyavaharika), and illusory (pratibhasika) levels of reality
- **Liberation through Knowledge**: Freedom (moksha) from the cycle of rebirth comes through direct recognition of one's identity with Brahman
- **Superimposition (Adhyasa)**: The fundamental error of attributing characteristics of one thing to another

The central teaching is captured in the Upanishadic mahavakya (great statement): "Tat Tvam Asi" (That Thou Art), indicating the essential identity between the individual self and ultimate reality.

## Historical Development

### Pre-Shankara Advaita
- Proto-Advaitic ideas in the early Upanishads (Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya)
- Gaudapada's Mandukya Karika (7th century CE), the first systematic exposition of Advaita
- Predecessors mentioned by tradition: Govinda Bhagavatpada, Gaudapada

### Shankaracharya and Classical Advaita (8th-9th century CE)
- Systematic interpretation of prasthanatraya (triple canonical texts)
- Establishment of monastic orders (mathas) in four corners of India
- Development of comprehensive philosophical system refuting Buddhist and other Hindu philosophies

### Post-Shankara Development
- **Vivarana school**: Founded by Prakashatman (10th century), emphasizing epistemological aspects
- **Bhamati school**: Founded by Vachaspati Mishra (9th century), emphasizing logical aspects
- **Vartika school**: Following Suresvara's direct disciplic interpretation

### Modern Revival (19th-20th century)
- Neo-Vedanta movement drawing on Advaitic concepts
- Swami Vivekananda's presentation of Advaita to the West
- Academic study and global dissemination of Advaitic philosophy

## Interpretative Framework

Advaita provides a comprehensive method for interpreting sacred texts:

### Hermeneutical Principles
- **Samanvaya**: Harmonizing seemingly contradictory Upanishadic statements
- **Lakshana**: Recognition of indirect or implied meaning
- **Badhitanuvritti**: Negation of provisional truths by higher truths
- **Arthavada**: Identification of supplementary or eulogistic passages
- **Six Marks of Interpretation** (Sadlinga): Beginning and conclusion, repetition, originality, result, praise, and reasoning

### Interpretation of Scriptural Categories
- **Sruti** (Revelation): Primary authority, particularly Upanishads
- **Smriti** (Remembrance): Secondary texts interpreted in light of Sruti
- **Nyaya** (Logic): Used as supportive tool, not independent authority
- **Anubhava** (Experience): Direct spiritual realization confirming scriptural truth

## Key Advaitic Interpretations of Sacred Texts

### Upanishadic Interpretations

#### Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7 - "Tat Tvam Asi" (That Thou Art)
- Interpreted as direct identity statement, not mere similarity
- Explained through "jahad-ajahad-lakshana" (selective negation-retention method)
- The statement negates limiting characteristics while retaining the essential identity

#### Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.10 - "Aham Brahmasmi" (I am Brahman)
- Interpreted as direct realization statement
- Not egoistic assertion but recognition of true nature
- Primary reference for self-knowledge (atma-vidya)

#### Mandukya Upanishad
- Four states of consciousness (waking, dream, deep sleep, turiya)
- Turiya as the transcendent fourth state identical with Brahman
- AUM as symbolic representation of Brahman

### Bhagavad Gita Interpretations

#### Shankara's Gita Bhashya
- Interprets the Gita primarily as a text of knowledge (jnana)
- Action (karma) and devotion (bhakti) as preparatory and purificatory
- Krishna's teaching of "inaction in action" interpreted as recognition of the Self as non-doer

#### Key Verses Interpreted by Advaita
- **Gita 13.2**: "Know me as the knower of the field" - identity of witness consciousness with Brahman
- **Gita 2.16**: "The unreal has no being; the real never ceases to be" - ontological foundation for Advaita
- **Gita 18.66**: "Abandon all dharmas" - interpreted as transcendence of all conditional activities through self-knowledge

### Brahma Sutra Interpretations

#### Shankara's Brahma Sutra Bhashya
- Systematically establishes Brahman as both efficient and material cause of universe
- Refutes dualistic Samkhya and other rival philosophies
- Establishes metaphysical non-dualism while allowing practical dualism at empirical level

#### Key Sutra Interpretations
- **Sutra 1.1.1**: "Now, therefore, inquiry into Brahman" - establishing Vedanta as investigation of ultimate reality
- **Sutra 1.1.2**: "Brahman is that from which the origin etc. of this world arise" - cosmological approach to Brahman
- **Sutra 2.1.14**: "Non-difference of effect from cause" - material causality supporting non-dualism

## Philosophical Concepts in Advaita Interpretation

### Brahman and Its Nature
- **Nirguna Brahman**: Brahman without attributes, beyond conceptualization
- **Saguna Brahman**: Brahman with attributes, manifested as Ishvara (God)
- **Sat-Chit-Ananda**: Being-Consciousness-Bliss as Brahman's nature

### Theory of Error and Illusion
- **Vivarta Vada**: Theory of apparent transformation rather than real change
- **Adhyasa**: Superimposition of the unreal on the real
- **Anirvachaniya**: The empirical world as neither real nor unreal but indefinable

### The Individual Self (Jiva)
- **Three Bodies**: Gross (sthula), subtle (sukshma), and causal (karana) bodies
- **Five Sheaths** (Panchakosha): Food, vital energy, mind, intellect, and bliss sheaths enveloping true Self
- **Three States**: Waking (jagrat), dream (svapna), and deep sleep (sushupti) as conditioned states

### The Process of Liberation
- **Fourfold Qualification** (Sadhana Chatustaya): Discernment, dispassion, six virtues, and desire for liberation
- **Threefold Path**: Hearing (shravana), reflection (manana), and meditation (nididhyasana)
- **Jivanmukti**: Liberation while still living in the body
