![Yajurveda manuscript page](yajurveda_manuscript.jpg)

The Yajurveda is the second of the four Vedas and serves as the primary liturgical collection of mantras for Vedic rituals and sacrifices. Its name derives from the Sanskrit terms "yajus" (sacrificial formula) and "veda" (knowledge), making it literally "the knowledge of sacrifice."

## Key Characteristics

- **Purpose**: Provides specific formulas, mantras, and instructions for performing various Vedic rituals
- **Composition Period**: Approximately 1200-800 BCE
- **Language**: Vedic Sanskrit
- **Length**: Contains approximately 1,975 verses (varying by recension)
- **Religious Role**: Forms the core textual basis for the office of the Adhvaryu, the priest who performs the physical aspects of the sacrifice

## Main Divisions

### Krishna (Black) Yajurveda

The Krishna Yajurveda contains mantras and prose explanations intermixed. The name "Black" refers to this unsystematic arrangement. Major recensions include:

- **Taittiriya Samhita**: The most widely used recension, followed in South India
- **Maitrayani Samhita**: Prevalent in the Gujarat and Maharashtra regions
- **Kathaka Samhita**: Once popular in Kashmir and northwestern regions
- **Kapishthala Samhita**: Lesser-known recension, closely related to the Kathaka

### Shukla (White) Yajurveda

The Shukla Yajurveda contains only the mantras without the explanatory prose. This cleaner, more systematic arrangement gives it the name "White." Its main recensions are:

- **Vajasaneyi Madhyandina**: Followed primarily in northern and western India
- **Vajasaneyi Kanva**: Popular in parts of eastern and southern India
