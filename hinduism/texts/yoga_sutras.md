![Yoga Sutras manuscript](yoga_sutras_manuscript.jpg)

The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali constitute one of the most influential texts in Indian philosophy and the foundational work of the classical Yoga school (Yoga Darshana). Composed around 400-500 CE, this concise Sanskrit text systematically outlines the science and practice of yoga, offering a comprehensive psychological system aimed at integrating mind, body, and spirit. Through 196 terse aphorisms (sutras), Patanjali presents a methodical eight-limbed path (ashtanga yoga) designed to lead practitioners toward samadhi (enlightenment) and kaivalya (liberation).

## The Eight Limbs of Yoga (Ashtanga Yoga)

Patanjali's most enduring contribution is the systematic eight-limbed path:

### 1. Yama (Ethical Restraints)

Five universal moral principles:

- **Ahimsa**: Non-violence in thought, word, and deed
- **Satya**: Truthfulness and honesty
- **Asteya**: Non-stealing and respect for others' possessions
- **Brahmacharya**: Ethical use of vital energy, often interpreted as sexual restraint

### 2. Niyama (Personal Observances)

Five self-discipline practices:

- **Saucha**: Purity and cleanliness of body and mind
- **Santosha**: Contentment and gratitude
- **Tapas**: Discipline and austerity
- **Svadhyaya**: Self-study and study of sacred texts
- **Ishvara Pranidhana**: Surrender to a higher power

### 3. Asana (Physical Postures)

- Defined as "steady and comfortable posture"
- Originally focused on seated meditation postures
- Later developed into the numerous physical postures of Hatha Yoga
- Purpose: Preparing the body for prolonged meditation

### 4. Pranayama (Breath Control)

- Regulation of breath through specific techniques
- Control of inhalation, exhalation, and retention
- Emphasis on making breath "long and subtle"
- Purpose: Calming the mind and increasing vital energy

### 5. Pratyahara (Sensory Withdrawal)

- Withdrawal of senses from their external objects
- Internalization of awareness
- Freedom from distraction by external stimuli
- Bridge between external and internal practices

### 6. Dharana (Concentration)

- Focusing the mind on a single point
- Initial stage of mental discipline
- Training attention to remain fixed on one object
- Preparation for deeper meditation

### 7. Dhyana (Meditation)

- Continuous flow of attention toward the object
- Distinguished from dharana by its uninterrupted nature
- Absence of awareness of self as separate from the object
- Precursor to samadhi

### 8. Samadhi (Absorption)

- Complete absorption in the object of meditation
- Dissolution of subject-object duality
- Various stages from cognitive to non-cognitive samadhi
- Culmination of the yogic path

## Key Philosophical Concepts

### Purusha and Prakriti

The Yoga Sutras incorporate Samkhya philosophy's dualism:

- **Purusha**: Pure consciousness, the seer, unchanging witness
- **Prakriti**: Nature, material reality, the seen
- **Entanglement**: How consciousness becomes identified with material phenomena
- **Liberation**: The re-establishment of purusha's distinction from prakriti
- **Kaivalya**: The final state of purusha existing in its own pure nature

### The Five Kleshas (Afflictions)

- **Relationship to Practice**: Devotion as an optional but effective path
- **Theological Position**: Neither requiring nor rejecting theism
