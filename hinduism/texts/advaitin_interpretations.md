# Advaita Vedanta Interpretations

![Ancient manuscript of Shankaracharya's commentary](advaitin_manuscript.jpg)

Advaita Vedanta represents one of the most influential interpretive traditions in Hindu philosophy, offering sophisticated non-dualistic readings of sacred texts that have profoundly shaped Hindu thought for over a millennium. Founded by Adi Shankaracharya (c. 788-820 CE), this hermeneutical tradition approaches scriptures through the lens of absolute non-dualism (advaita), interpreting diverse texts to reveal the ultimate unity of Brahman (the Absolute) and Atman (the individual self). Through an intricate system of exegesis that distinguishes between levels of truth and employs strategic hermeneutical principles, Advaita commentators have created a comprehensive philosophical vision that continues to influence contemporary Hindu scholarship and spiritual practice.

## Core Hermeneutical Principles

### Levels of Truth (Satya-bheda)

- **Paramarthika (Ultimate Reality)**: The absolute non-dual level of truth
- **Vyavaharika (Empirical Reality)**: The conventional, transactional level
- **Pratibhasika (Apparent Reality)**: The illusory level (like mistaking rope for snake)
- **Textual Applications**: How texts are interpreted differently at each level

### Six Interpretive Criteria (Shad-linga)

- **Upakrama-upasamhara** (Beginning and conclusion): Consistency between opening and closing statements
- **Abhyasa** (Repetition): Emphasis through repetition indicates importance
- **Apurvata** (Novelty): Teachings not available through other means
- **Phala** (Fruit): Purpose or result of the teaching
- **Arthavada** (Explanatory praise): Contextual importance of laudatory statements
- **Upapatti** (Logical argumentation): Rational coherence of interpretation

### Harmonization Techniques

- **Samanvaya** (Reconciliation): Methods for resolving apparent textual contradictions
- **Primary and Secondary Meaning**: Distinguishing between mukhya and gauna interpretations
- **Implied Meaning**: Use of lakshana (indication) where literal reading is problematic
- **Reinterpretation of Dualistic Passages**: Strategies for non-dual readings

### Indicative Method (Lakshana)

- **Jahallakshana**: Completely setting aside primary meaning
- **Ajahallakshana**: Retaining part of the primary meaning
- **Jahadajahallakshana**: Partly retaining and partly abandoning primary meaning
