# Shaiva Texts

![Ancient Shiva-related manuscript](shaiva_manuscript.jpg)

Shaiva texts form one of the most extensive and diverse textual traditions within Hinduism, encompassing philosophical treatises, mythological narratives, ritual manuals, devotional poetry, and esoteric tantric works. Centered on the worship and understanding of Shiva—the deity associated with destruction, transformation, and transcendence—these texts span over two millennia of continuous development and have profoundly influenced Hindu thought, practice, and culture. From the sophisticated non-dualist philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism to the devotional Tamil hymns of the Nayanar saints, Shaiva literature represents a rich tapestry of religious expression that continues to shape contemporary Hindu spirituality.
