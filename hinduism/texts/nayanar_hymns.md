The Nayanar hymns, collectively known as the Tirumurai, constitute the sacred canon of Tamil Shaivism. Composed between the 6th and 10th centuries CE by the 63 Nayanar saints, these poetic works represent one of the most significant bhakti (devotional) movements in Hinduism, laying the foundation for the development of Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and practice in South India. Rich in emotional fervor, theological insight, and literary merit, these hymns continue to play a central role in Tamil Shaiva religious life.
