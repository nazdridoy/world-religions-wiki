# Alvar Hymns

![Ancient manuscript of Divya Prabandham](alvar_manuscript.jpg)

The Alvar hymns, collectively known as the Nalayira Divya Prabandham ("Divine Collection of 4,000 Verses"), form the sacred canon of Tamil Vaishnavism. Composed between the 6th and 9th centuries CE by the Alvars (literally, "those immersed in God"), these poetic works represent one of the earliest and most influential bhakti (devotional) movements in Hinduism, laying the foundation for the later development of Vaishnava theology and practice, particularly in South India.

## The Alvars

### The Twelve Poet-Saints

Tradition recognizes twelve Alvars, each with a distinctive voice and contribution:

1. **Poigai Alvar**: Composed the first hundred verses of the Divya Prabandham
2. **Bhutattalvar**: Continued with the second hundred
3. **Peyalvar**: Completed the third hundred of the introductory section
4. **Tirumazhisai Alvar**: Former Shaivite who converted to Vaishnavism
5. **Nammalvar**: Considered the greatest of the Alvars, composed about 1,350 verses
6. **Madhurakavi Alvar**: Disciple of Nammalvar, composed only ten verses, all in praise of his guru
7. **Kulasekhara Alvar**: A royal poet who renounced his kingdom for devotion
8. **Periyalvar**: Known for composing verses imagining himself as mother Yashoda to baby Krishna
9. **Andal**: The only female Alvar, daughter of Periyalvar, known for her bridal mysticism
10. **Tondaradippodi Alvar**: Known for emphasizing humility and service
11. **Tiruppan Alvar**: Born in a socially marginalized community, exemplifies bhakti's transcendence of social barriers
12. **Tirumangai Alvar**: Former chieftain and initially a brigand who became a devout composer

### Historical Context

The Alvars lived and composed during a period of significant religious and cultural transformation in South India:

- The period saw competition between Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Buddhism, and Jainism
- The Alvars helped establish Vaishnavism as a major tradition in the Tamil region
- Their work represents an indigenous South Indian expression of devotion that would later influence northern traditions

## The Nalayira Divya Prabandham

### Structure and Organization

The Nalayira Divya Prabandham consists of 4,000 verses organized into four sections:

1. **Mudal Ayiram** (First Thousand): Mainly works of the first three Alvars
2. **Irandam Ayiram** (Second Thousand): Includes Tirumangai Alvar's works
3. **Munram Ayiram** (Third Thousand): Contains the Tiruvaymoli of Nammalvar
4. **Nankan Ayiram** (Fourth Thousand): Contains works of several Alvars, including Andal

### Major Works Within the Collection

Several works within the Divya Prabandham are particularly renowned:

- **Tiruvaymoli** (Sacred Utterance): Nammalvar's magnum opus, considered equivalent to the Vedas
- **Tiruppavai**: Andal's 30 verses on the Margali observance, among the most beloved devotional works in Tamil
- **Periyalvar Tirumoli**: Periyalvar's poems imagining Krishna's childhood
- **Tiruppallandu**: Periyalvar's benedictory hymn
- **Tirumalai**: Tondaradippodi Alvar's work focusing on Ranganatha of Srirangam

## Themes and Theology

### Emotional Dimensions of Devotion

The Alvar hymns explore various emotional modes of devotion:

- **Parental love**: Periyalvar's verses expressing motherly love for baby Krishna
- **Romantic love**: Andal's bridal mysticism and Nammalvar's use of feminine voice
- **Friendship**: Intimate, personal relationship with the divine
- **Servitude**: Humility and service as expressions of devotion
- **Desperation**: Intense longing for God in separation

### Theological Innovations

The Alvars developed several theological concepts that influenced later Vaishnava thought:

- **Accessible deity**: God who responds to devotion rather than ritual expertise
- **Divine grace**: Emphasis on God's initiative in salvation
- **Universal salvation**: Bhakti as available to all regardless of caste or gender
- **Temple-centered devotion**: Focus on specific sacred sites and temple icons
- **Incarnational theology**: Detailed reflection on divine descent (avatara)

### Sacred Geography

The Alvars sang about specific sacred sites, creating a devotional geography:

- **Divya Desams**: 108 sacred Vaishnava temples praised by the Alvars
- **Tirupati**: Venkateshwara temple as a major focus of devotion
- **Srirangam**: Temple of Ranganatha, considered especially sacred
