Dvaita Vedanta, also known as Tattvavada (the philosophy of reality) or Bhedavada (the philosophy of difference), is one of the major schools of Vedanta philosophy within Hinduism. Founded by Madhvacharya (1238-1317 CE), Dvaita Vedanta presents a strictly dualistic interpretation of the Vedantic texts, emphasizing the eternal distinction between individual souls (jivas), material world (prakriti), and the Supreme Being (Brahman/Vishnu).

## Core Principles of Dvaita Interpretation

### Fundamental Dualism

The central tenet of Dvaita interpretation is the existence of five fundamental differences (pancha-bheda):

1. **Jiva-Ishvara Bheda**: The eternal difference between individual souls and God
2. **Jiva-Jiva Bheda**: The difference between individual souls
3. **Jada-Ishvara Bheda**: The difference between insentient matter and God
4. **Jada-Jiva Bheda**: The difference between insentient matter and souls
5. **Jada-Jada Bheda**: The difference between different forms of insentient matter

These differences are considered real, eternal, and not subject to reconciliation or unity.

### Interpretation of Key Vedantic Concepts

- **Brahman**: Unlike Advaita's impersonal absolute, Dvaita identifies Brahman specifically with Vishnu/Narayana as the Supreme Personal God
- **Atman**: Individual souls are distinct from God, eternally dependent, and subject to hierarchy
- **Maya**: Not an illusion but a real power of God that creates the diverse material world
- **Moksha**: Liberation through devotion to Vishnu, not through realization of identity with Brahman

## Madhvacharya's Textual Approach

### Basis in Traditional Texts

Madhvacharya wrote commentaries on all the principal Vedantic texts:

- **Brahma Sutras**: His commentary "Brahma Sutra Bhashya" refutes monism and establishes dualism
- **Upanishads**: Commentaries on ten principal Upanishads interpret passages to support dualism
- **Bhagavad Gita**: His "Gita Bhashya" emphasizes devotion to Krishna as the highest path

### Hermeneutic Principles

Madhvacharya's approach to textual interpretation includes:

1. **Shruti Pramanatva**: The authority of the Vedas as the primary source of knowledge
2. **Logical Analysis**: Rigorous use of logic to support interpretations
3. **Rejection of Metaphorical Readings**: Preference for literal interpretation of texts
4. **Hierarchical Understanding**: Texts organized in a hierarchy of authority, with apparent contradictions resolved by giving precedence to clearer statements

## Key Dvaita Texts and Commentaries

### Primary Works by Madhvacharya

- **Anuvyakhyana**: Detailed explanation of his Brahma Sutra commentary
- **Vishnu Tattva Vinirnaya**: Establishes the supremacy of Vishnu
- **Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya**: Dvaita interpretation of the Mahabharata
- **Dashopanishad Bhashya**: Commentaries on ten principal Upanishads

### Works by Later Dvaita Scholars

- **Nyayamrita** by Vyasatirtha: Defends Dvaita against Advaita arguments
- **Tarangini** by Jagannatha Tirtha: Commentary on Madhva's Brahma Sutra Bhashya
- **Parimala** by Raghavendra Tirtha: Commentary clarifying difficult aspects of Dvaita philosophy
- **Bhavaprakashika** by Jayatirtha: Commentary on Madhva's Gita interpretation

## Philosophical Arguments in Dvaita Interpretation

### Critique of Non-Dualism

Dvaita philosophers systematically critique Advaita interpretations through:

1. **Logical Analysis**: Demonstrating logical inconsistencies in the concept of non-duality
2. **Textual Evidence**: Presenting Vedic passages that explicitly affirm differences
3. **Experiential Reality**: Arguing that experience confirms the reality of difference

### The Doctrine of Inherent Nature (Svabhava)

Dvaita maintains that each entity has an inherent nature that cannot be changed:

- Souls are eternally dependent on God
- Material objects have inherent qualities
- God has inherent perfection and independence

## The Three-Tier Reality

Dvaita interpretation organizes reality into three tiers:

1. **Svatantra**: The independent reality (only God/Vishnu)
2. **Paratantra**: The dependent sentient reality (souls)
3. **Asatantra**: The dependent insentient reality (matter)

## Contemporary Relevance

### Living Tradition

Dvaita Vedanta remains a living tradition, particularly through:

- The Madhva matha institutions, especially in Karnataka
- Scholarly works continuing to develop and defend Dvaita interpretations
- Integration with Vaishnava devotional practices

### Academic Study

Contemporary academic interest in Dvaita includes:

- Comparative studies with Western philosophical dualism
- Analysis of Madhva's logical techniques
- Exploration of theological implications of strict dualism

## Comparison with Other Vedantic Interpretations

### Contrasts with Advaita

- **Reality**: Real multiplicity vs. apparent multiplicity
- **Brahman**: Personal God vs. impersonal absolute
- **Liberation**: Eternal communion with God vs. merger with Brahman

### Contrasts with Vishishtadvaita

- **Soul-God Relation**: Eternally separate vs. body-soul relationship
- **Nature of Difference**: Absolute vs. qualified
- **Creation**: Real creation vs. transformation of God's body
